    "content": "Love the oriental fragility here, like an ink drawing. Re. your lens withdrawal... I pulled out my not-recently-used  Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM this AM. It was early, but bright  yet I was in the city's canyons. Set the ISO at 330 and started harvesting street portraits. Without chimping the images closely. Bad idea... Managed to get, um, really creative blurs. At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it. \n\nYes... yes... it is a very good idea to either voluntarily or involuntarily go the bench and pull out the least used players. Especially when they can perform as you've managed here."
