The photo of the couple is equally engrossing not only for the composition and crop which I think is perfect but for the story it tells. However the story I got from it (before reading your post) is different to yours. I see the girl as being in front of the man and so I see it as a missed opportunity, a chance meeting that was not meant to be, two people who came so close to each other and yet may never know of each other's existence.\nIn any case it's wonderful photography Andreas."
