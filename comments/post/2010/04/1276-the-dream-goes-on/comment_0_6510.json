    "content": "Well, I confess being a little prejudice. I've been a fan for a long time, and was his lighting designer on tour in '79 - '80. That Wikipedia write-up is very accurate. I tell people a joke for shock value. I'll say \"I once went to a pool party where Liv Tyler was naked.\" Beat. \"The only issue was she was four years old at the time.\" Todd used to have summer pool parties for his crew, and Liv was living at his house when she thought she was his daughter, not Steven Tyler's. And the kids were all running around without clothes. It's a cheap joke, I'll admit. However, I really like Todd's music quite a bit and someone with your seeming encyclopedic knowledge of music might appreciate him"
