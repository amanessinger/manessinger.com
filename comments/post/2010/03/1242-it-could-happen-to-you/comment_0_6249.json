    "content": "LOL, the cyclist was going the wrong way, therefore had a crash?\n\nEinbaum - according to 2 German to English dictionaries, means a \"dug-out canoe,\" with \"baum\" meaning \"tree.\" But when I saw the street sign, I thought it meant a one-way street. So - what does the sign mean? Dug-out canoes can be found in this direction?\n\nSo I really don 't understand the point of your image, unless it means what I thought it meant - the shadow or wet place to the left of the bicycle could be blood - the rider got hurt when he collided with the arrow-bearing post.\n\nThe 2nd image with the graffiti and the out of focus man - I like this very much and do not consider it a failure. It is a failure only in your eyes, Andreas, because you didn't capture the man where you wanted him. But just look at it from another viewpoint: the man is walking towards the center of the image. The graffiti, altho seems to be spelling out a word, also has little feet attached to ends of each downward stroke - which to me means that the letters forming the word are also walking toward the center. The image itself is cut down the center into two distinct images - but they work together. Andreas, as far as I'm concerned, this image is a resounding success! \n\nThanks, also, for the link to that TEDx talk. Funny, but also enlightening."
