    "content": "Once upon a time I swore I would always buy the disc. I wanted to know that I had something physical and I wanted the booklet that usually accompanied the CD. Then one day I decided to rip all my CDs to a hard drive so that I could create play lists and sync my songs to my portable player. It was then that I realised that I rarely looked at the booklet and that my CDs were taking up a lot of shelf space. Further it wasn't long before I realised that I was listening to my music much more often now that it was so accessible and didn't involve finding CDs, loading them etc. So now I buy downloads, easier, quicker and often cheaper. Now I can't wait for downloadable films and I can stop buying DVDs.\n\nbtw, love your shallow dof images Andreas."
