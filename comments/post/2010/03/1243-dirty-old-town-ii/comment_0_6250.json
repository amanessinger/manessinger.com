    "content": "Andreas, I hope that by this time, you are feeling much better and back on your feet again. Winter returns, winter goes away, over and over, all spring, it seems. Right now my area is engulfed in a predicted 3-5 inches of rain, which if it were below freezing would become 3-5 feet of snow!\n\nAbout graffiti, I've often said that I wish there were a way for society to provide these artists - some of them really are super artists - with a way to beautiful the community plus earn a living for themselves. How about murals? Or painting on panels that people could buy? But so far, no one has come forward to help these people who feel the need to express themselves artistically, but who have no means or place in which to do so.\n\nHowever, the particular person who did this painting that you photographed doesn't measure up in my eye to the true graffiti artists. So in this respect, I agree with Ted. But, like you said, what would the grimier parts of cities be without graffiti? They have no beautiful wildflowers to look at, so they make their own kind of beauty.\n\nThere have been a few cases of companies offering graffiti artists fence or wall space to beautify - construction companies who have to put up wooden fences around their sites - and a couple of towns - but these are few and far between. I doubt that the graffiti artists were paid for their efforts."
