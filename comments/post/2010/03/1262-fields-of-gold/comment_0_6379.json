I traded in my Tamron 90mm macro, as the autofocus completely would not work. And also I didn't like the way it worked. I got a speedlight instead - SB-900, which I have use for more often than a macro lens.\n\nI like this image and the one with the road and railing and trees from your previous post. It seems like everywhere you go in Austria, there are beautiful scenic landscapes to shoot. The only problem for me would be - which way to I point the lens, and how much to crop out!"
