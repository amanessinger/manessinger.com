You tried your best and that's what counts, not all the \"even ifs\" - so, shake out your mental cobwebs and \"snap to it\"! Just remember that you have an overwhelming amount of excellent images that any photographer would be proud to have made. Tomorrow is a chance for a new slate, a tabula rosa upon which you can lay down those pixels and \"make visual music\" again!\n\nAnyway, I see nothing wrong with this image and I like it - but probably it doesn't fit what you saw, as you seem to feel you didn't successfully capture the glow of the sun's reflection the way you saw it while there."
