    "content": "Andreas, I love this image. It's feeling is warm and cozy - I've just come from outside where it's hovering at the freezing mark! \n\nIf you were a songwriter or composer of music, you'd feel just as proprietary about your hard work as photographers do about their images! It doesn't matter whether an image has been printed, or if it exists as a film negative that has never been printed, or as a bunch of pixels/photons on a hard drive, that image represents a photographer's hard work - and is given the same copyright protection as other property, such as paintings and sculptures, whether it ever is published or not. So I don't understand why music should be any different.\n\nAll of us have seen paintings, sculptures, photo images, and other art work that we'd just love to be able to own - but we can't just go and take them for our own use. But you want songwriters and composers to be willing to fork over their hard work to you for nothing, if they choose not to publish their work! I'm just not sure I understand what you mean by \"publish or give it up.\" You give something up only after you die, as you certainly can't take it with you!\n\nShould I give up all my images because I choose not to \"publish\" them, which means putting them on the internet or printing and hanging them in a gallery?"
