    "content": "Excellent essay on the price-setting from the customer point of view. \n\nOne potentially interesting area for artistist of various kinds to explore is the area of \"unique\" objects or events where the pricing can be quite flexible, and might in fact sustain the artist in the long run better than selling digital material: concerts, autographed objects, performance-type events, fan-club activities etc. This might mean returning from the mass-produced art to the level of an \"individual artist\"."
