I like dreamy blurs and this is so nice and dreamy.\n\nThat said, thanks for the advice about the IS/VR lenses, Steve. And Andreas, now I have another reason to avoid Tamron lenses in the future. I'm going to try to trade in my fairly new Tamron 90mm macro, mostly due to the autofocus problem with Nikon bodies - but I just don't like the lens anyway.\n\nFlo"
