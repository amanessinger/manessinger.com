I guess it's like those who do crosswords and math puzzles and brain teasers - it's a good mental exercise.\n\nAs I look at this image, I wonder whether, if you were to photograph this same scene 4 times, once for each season, which I'd like better. Perhaps some day you'll post the 4 seasons, if you have such for any particular scene?"
