    "content": "A \"little thing\"?  Talk about understatement!  For most images, I think most will agree that light makes all the difference.  I know there are those who downplay the importance of light, but I've always had trouble with that argument.  Your comparison here is an excellent example.  The first image is OK, but this one instantly grabs you.  And I think the timing was perfect.  If you'd waited for the street lamp in the foreground to come on, it would have spoiled the effect (in my opinion)."
