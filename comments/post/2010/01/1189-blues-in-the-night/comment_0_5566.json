In this case it was just the kind of tilt where the camera had the best support from the wall ðŸ˜„\n\nNormally when I make a tilted image, I decide by feeling. If it feels good to me in terms of lines, proportions, balance, weight of the different parts of the image, I do it that way. So much of what I do is experimental, but of course you get to like some things more than others, and that way you develop sort of a style, even when your tools introduce a random component."
