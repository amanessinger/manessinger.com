I agree about one of the nice things about winter, lol, shorter days in which we have a greater chance to catch sunrises and sunsets, moon rises and moon sets.\n\nBTW, when native English speakers move their belongings from one place to another, we say simply that we're moving. We reserve the word migration for animals and birds when they go south for the winter and then come back for the summer.\n\nWe also say that human populations migrate out of the cities to the suburbs or back from the suburbs to the cities. A migration in this sense is describing a trend that groups are following. But for individuals, we usually say we're moving. Hope you don't mind my comments on migration versus moving.  Wish I could speak German as well as you handle English! I can count to 10 and that's about it, plus yes or no. ðŸ™‚\n\nI'm glad you were successful finally, getting Michael to his new \"digs\"."
