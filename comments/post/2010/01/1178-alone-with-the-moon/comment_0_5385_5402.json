When Germans combine two nouns and thus create a new word, this word is still derived. It is very uncommon that we make up new words of nothing. We frequently borrow English words though and in earlier times French.\n\nOn the other hand, in English it is quite normal to simply create a word from a sound, a feeling, and sometimes I think even I could do it and I possibly could be understood. Why? Because it is in a way expected. This language is open to innovation and it happens all the time. \n\nBut it's always good to get a helping hand. Thanks again ðŸ™‚"
