It's more fun to be out and about when it's snowing - but not blizzarding - just nice gentle huge fluffy white flakes.\n\nProbably a job as a meteorologist is the only job in which you won't get fired for being wrong much of the time, lol!\n\nNow if I were a kid again, I'd want to run right over there and start playing."
