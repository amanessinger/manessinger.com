    "content": "Thanks. While I take photographs or even during post-processing, the title or the Song of the Day play no role whatsoever. This only happens when I sit down to write.\n\nThe first thing I do is to associate words. I try to find words that match either aspects of the image or of its genesis. Then I search for these words in a file with a list of all my songs. If something inspires me, then I search for an online copy via Google video search. If I find something, this is it. It's really an afterthought, although the whole process may consume more time than the whole photographic part."
