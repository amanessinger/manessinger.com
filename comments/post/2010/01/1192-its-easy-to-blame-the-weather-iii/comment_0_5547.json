    "content": "Well, the line of thought went something like this... \n\nIn southern Europe, the plage hit mostly to the poor people, but in the well-to-do classes the effect was much more slight. And those who survived had a rather good monetary situation (less people to divide the property), and could afford to take it easy. \n\nOn the other hand, it seems that in England the situation was a bit different. The plague hit both aristocrats and poor, almost in equal measure, and the rise of the middle classes was speeded up because of this.\n\nWhat was interesting was also the rapid spread of the disease (end of 1347 to 1348, from Italy to England). And some of the factors, such as the fact that cats were thought to be evil (church...) and killed in masses, and rats being used as pets.\n\nBut I don't know much about this, although the time period is indeed very interesting.\n\nHaiti earthquake - that's another matter entirely. Help is sorely needed, in any case."
