    "content": "I like both images for different reasons The colour one has an interesting contrast between the warm glow from the sun and the cool blue while the b&amp;w highlights the shadows and tones nicely.\n\nI'm equally fascinated with Ted Byrne's comment. I will admit to never having thought of the points he makes regarding colour vs b&amp;w. Rather thought provoking though interestingly enough I have never associated b&amp;w with melancholy, nostalgia or gloom. I will usually associate those feelings with the subject matter rather than with the rendering of the image. Having said that I will add that I am a big fan of Ted's colour work and I will readily admit that I find many of his images exceptionally uplifting."
