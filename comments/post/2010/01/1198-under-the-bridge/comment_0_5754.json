    "content": "After a half century of overwhelmingly monochrome photography, the liberation into a full color palette which digital permits enervates me. Which is why I have created no more than a half dozen B&amp;W images in the past decade. However, there's something else that discourages me from further exploring the two color world. \n\nMonochrome has an inherent melancholy bias. Yes it can be overcome, but it's as if the artist starts up a hill with a bag filled with lead. Recently I began reading a large retrospective on the works of the great photographic artists of the first six decades of the last century. Most of them were struggling to communicate political feelings, almost entirely in B&amp;W. In fact Cartier Bresson was an arch opponent to color photography under any circumstances. \n\nIt's one thing to intend to communicate a grim feeling, or an idea grimly. It is another to carry a message within an unintended shell of gloom. Perhaps this scene you represent does speak to the excretions and detritus - the negative bi-products of culture, or the human condition. And perhaps that message is best conveyed by surgically removing any romanticism carried by a hint of colored light. \n\nPerhaps... But perhaps it is the easy way out? After all, color is dimension of the human condition, right? There is still much to be discovered in monochrome, but I wonder if there would be much enthusiasm to seek it out if the photographic magazines did not have a major economic incentive to print monochrome as opposed to full dimensional color? Is a lot of the enthusiasm for monochrome determined by economic necessity, or is it driven by either a nostalgia, or desire to seek the quickest way to assert an edgy grittiness? \n\nIn the words of Yule Brenner.... \"It is a puzzlement.\""
