    "content": "I always use the most automatic metering, i.e. matrix metering on the D300 and the equivalent, whatever it is called, on the LX5. This is not film. You can always look at the display and repeat with some exposure correction dialed in.\n\nBut yes, exposure is difficult with such a wide lens, because the bigger the scene, the wider the tonal range. In many cases I use HDR."
