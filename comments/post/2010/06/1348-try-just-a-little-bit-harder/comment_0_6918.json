I should give it a try this year.\n\nI'm looking forward to what you come up with. Urban Dreams I is a superb visual revelation, and a very clever way of conceiving of compositional elements. Pattern recognition is apparently a significant part of intelligence, but you have to notice the pattern first. The book is a great reminder of what we usually don't \"see.\""
