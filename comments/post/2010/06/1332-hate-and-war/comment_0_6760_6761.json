It never happened peacefully, but if you look at what today's Italians are, that's a wild mixture of Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Normans, Langobardians, East Goths, West Goths, and whatever Germanic tribe rushed through. Today it's just Italians. On the other hand, today the north hates the south and there are strong forces struggling for secession ðŸ˜„\n\nI still have hope that the EU may fuse Europe together over the course of maybe 100 years, maybe 200, essentially making for United States of Europe, but the only chance for long-term peace is a world-government with strong delegation to regional units. Thus not some large countries and many small, but one overall Earth and many semi-autonomous regions of roughly the same head count. Or size. Or something in between.\n\nThanks for visiting ðŸ™‚"
