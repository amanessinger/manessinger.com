    "content": "I always found it a bit strange that Image Stabilisation is so rarely available for those critical lenses. It's exactly the same in the Canon part of the world. Canon itself only produces the 17-55mm f2.8 lens with IS, which is a lens \"only\" for crop-cameras. Nothing is available for full format. \n\nHowever, truth be told, that lens is absolutely fabulous."
