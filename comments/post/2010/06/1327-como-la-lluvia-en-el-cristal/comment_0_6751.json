Okay, I know that the song of lenses from the store windows is so sensuous that we will have to lash you to the mast Ulysses-like lest you run your wallet into the rocks each time you pass. But, there may be a muffler to their singing? I'm wondering if http://www.topazlabs.com/denoise/ or the newly released Topaz DeNoise 4 might allow you to exploit some high resolution but slower pieces of glass? \n\nIf DeNoise legitimately grabs two-three additional stops... If... if... if... would it change your longing for lens openings the size of automobile tunnels? One thing though... the lenses you carry save you money. After all, carting them around avoids the necessity of buying a gym membership, right? \n\nSeriously, I'm wondering if Topaz (or one of its competitors) might be a serious alternative to super bright lenses... but on the other hand, they probably just allow us to still buy the f1.2, or f1.0 tubes and shoot in available darkness, eh? BTW... the image is brilliant."
