I'm so jealous of Europeans (and Asians). This hemisphere is just too new.\n\nIt's a great blog post, by the way. A lot of photos and commentary is appropriate for the subject. They're great, even the highly processed ones. I'm liking the looks of the 70-300 too. The compression effect works more beautifully with these colourful buildings that it does with the dull monochrome of steel and glass skylines. At least, it works really well in *these* images."
