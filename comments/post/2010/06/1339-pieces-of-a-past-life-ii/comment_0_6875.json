How very very sad that people would move on and not try to create opportunities, like you suggested can be done to enliven this area.\n\nTwo images each show one car. And someone still cares enough to hang baskets of flowering plants in the platz. So there's probably still interest there, but no vision. Sometimes it takes an outsider to come in and revitalize the local residents' vision."
