    "content": "Good grief! WHAT is holding this tall modern building up? I'm expecting it to come crashing down at any moment on unsuspecting cars and people! I feel unsettled. Visually, this is shocking for me. Perhaps if I could see it in person, I'd feel differently. I find myself wishing that this building is not there. I'd love to return this lovely section of this town to its former beauty.\n\nI do like the 2nd image. I think I'd crop up from the bottom a bit more to get the couple out of the \"rule of thirds\" position - just to give the viewer a little hint of something different from what they've been trained to expect as far as subject placement goes."
