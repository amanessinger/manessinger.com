I love how that \"fence\"  or barrier interrupts the eye's movement from upper left along the implied major diagonal on its way to the lower right corner. The dark poles stop the eye and make it back up a tad to see the man and scooter.\n\nHad I been the one to try to frame this scene, I'd probably have tried to avoid getting that barrier in the image - and so would have missed this interaction among the elements of this image.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your vacation!"
