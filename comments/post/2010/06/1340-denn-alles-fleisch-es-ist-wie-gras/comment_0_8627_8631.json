So far I've made 24 Images of the Day with it, which more or less means that I have had 24 days since I've bought it, where I have used it almost exclusively. Otoh, I've bought it, when? Must have been June 4 or 5 this year. That's not even half a year. Well, if I look at it that way, 24 IotD are not that bad ðŸ™‚\n\nMy main lens is the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC. Since June the only lens wider than the Tamron, that I've used, was the Sigma 8-16. I have no scientific approach though. If you ask me for a hyperfocal length, honestly, I have no idea. It's not in my style. I don't shoot for total sharpness, yes, it's rather the opposite. Most of the time I go into the macro range and use my lenses at distances, where complete sharpness wouldn't even be possible. I don't care.\n\nBut of course if you do care, it's easy to make the test. Just shoot a sequence of images, focused further and further away. Then see what works for you, what is an acceptable range for you.\n\nThis is very subjective, and it depends mostly on how near a foreground you want to include (some people love the wide-angle distortion, some don't), and whether you want everything sharp or accept (or desire) a bit of foreground blur.\n\nDoes this sound vague? Sure, but what I try to tell you is, that there is no objective answer to such a seemingly simple question."
