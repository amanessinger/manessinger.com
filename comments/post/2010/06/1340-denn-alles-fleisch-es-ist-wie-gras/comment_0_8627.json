    "content": "Thank you very much for your review of this lens. I just bought one yesterday to replace my aging Sigma 10-20. You're absolutely right about having to know how to use an ultra-wide effectively, as I've learned from my own experience shooting land and seascapes. Even at 10mm on my old lens, at first I was blown away, but after a while I felt the itch to go even wider. It's amazing how only 2mm makes such a huge difference. I recall my first word being \"Wow!\" when first looking through the viewfinder. Now that I think about it, I think I said the same thing 2 years ago when I bought the 10-20.\n\nI've done a bit of architecture to give the lens a test run, and I must say I am in love already! Just in curiosity though, what have you discovered to be the best hyperfocal length? I haven't had a lot of time to experiment yet, but so far I got pretty good results setting the focus ring to 2 feet while shooting at f/16 at the widest end of the zoom. I guess diffraction might be a bigger issue with a lens of this type, so I'm thinking I shouldn't go past f/11 if I can help it.\n\nYou've had a few months longer to play around with the 8-16, so I was just wondering if you could pass along any tidbits that might help out a fellow photographer. Cheers!"
