    "content": "Hehe, thanks all. I already have a 64 bit driver, whether it will install or not, that's to be seen. If I manage to get the NVIDIA card to work under 64 bit, I just have to install Photoshop et al., and my games for those log train sessions, and then I'm done.

Those were the days when cars could be fixed by lay people without computers to aid them ðŸ™‚"
