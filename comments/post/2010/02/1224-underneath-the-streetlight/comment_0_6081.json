The sky was still bright, but because of the light and the resulting underexposure, it all came out much more colorful than I had seen it for real. And not only that: The yellow light pushed automatic white balance far into blue territory, giving me nice color contrast.\n\nThis is one of those things that you just have to find out. Of course, with much experience you begin to know such things, but because you can't see it, it always stays a little bit awkward. Seeing is so much easier than having to remember ðŸ™‚."
