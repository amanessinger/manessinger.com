    "content": "I just found the points here on this blog that convince me again to buy this lens ...soon.\n\nIf the fact wasn't wrong and I wasn't wrong, wouldn't it f/2.8 will be soft due to DOF? ...even the subject is a Landscape. Things will be even softer when below f/1.8 (ofcoz that the center is SHARP)\n\nI do think it is sensible when we inspect corner sharpness below f/4 on any lens would more or less produce the same result. I had tested f/3.5 on my kitlens ... under low light in the evening with hand held. It will be a bit blur when shot on 17mm at 1/4 speed, ISO 3200 with Image Stabilizer Off.\nIt was hack a lot of difference when IS is switch ON  .... on the same setting. Hence, VC is very helpful on low light environment. \n\nIndoor low light, ISO 1600 only gave me 1/80 on f/4 ... but it will be double as 1/160 with f/2.8 (it will be less different when speed drops to 1/30 on very low light)\n\nI strongly support your findings and verdict here ^^\n\nCheers n God bless~"
