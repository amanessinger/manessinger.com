The man could also be thinking that he wishes he could be free of the chore of having to walk the dog periodically. Even tho he probably loves the dog otherwise.\n\nYour experiences with trying to install Windows 7 on your laptop remind me that I always have the experts do stuff like this for me! Sure, it costs money, but in the long run, I don't lose whatever stuff I didn't remember to back up before trying to install some stuff and in so doing, crash the computer. I'm mostly \"thumbs\" when it comes to doing things like this for myself. Good luck."
