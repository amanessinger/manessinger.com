    "content": "This street does have a couple of funny wiggles in it. I like it because it gives the street character as well as gives character to your images of it.\n\nI like the time of day - a little hard to tell from the clock face - 5:40? - but the sky is blue, light enough to register in the camera, but not light enough to turn off the lights - and it looks like a cloud bank in the distance.\n\nWhen you shoot at 1/4 second, surely you are standing perfectly still, with arms braced against your body or the camera braced against a pole or wall, aren't you? In other words, you are shooting with more care than when you shoot at 1/100 second, aren't you?"
