I don't feel like I'm going to fall out of the image - for some reason, this tilt just seems natural to me!\n\nIt might make an interesting image if, when you are back at this place, to put your camera on the pavement and shoot without looking through the viewfinder. Better with a little more light, tho, as you'd probably have to tilt the camera slightly upwards, which wouldn't be steady for a longer shutter speed."
