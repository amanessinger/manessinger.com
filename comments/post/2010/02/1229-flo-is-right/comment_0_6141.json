    "content": "\"Flo's Law of the Cozy Tilt\" - ROTFLOL! Sorry I'm getting here a little late. But you just illustrated what I meant when I made that comment on tilted images a while ago.\n\nAs for a song with Florence in it - there was an old song that people used to tease me with when we were in college - about late 1940s-early 1950s - its first line went something like: \"Down the river St. Lawrence, I went hollering \"Florence\" - - - I don't remember the rest of that song - you'd think I would, as for a while it became the bane of my existence."
