It almost makes me smile, and  I think of the word pizzicato.\n \nWhen I was quite young at home in  Philadelphia … there came at night a New York station onto our radios… WOR. And they had a bouncy jingle which this image evokes…\n\n“Pizzicato always makes me happy,\nPizzicato never makes me blue.\nSo we’ve recorded our station call letters\nIn pizzicato style for you.\nW ! O! R!”\n\nThe minarets, their perky colors, the needles spiking into the sky. The way the window corridors look like the picket fences that boys will rake a stick across as they run by….. Tickety-tickety-tickety…. \n\nAnd then the vehicle domes perking up below… Like a plucked base line...\n\nThis is a jingle. A lighthearted melody of palette and shapes that dance … leap … up into the vertical to fill the negative space way way up there. \n\nLuvvit…."
