    "content": "Development in Camera RAW with much fill light and contrast, balanced by brightness. I did that to even out the enormous contrast and light falloff from Top to bottom. The result was flat and with dull colors.  \n\nTopaz Adjust 4 filter \"Spicify\", applied with a mask, practically everywhere, but only sparingly in the sky. \n\nAdded a neutral blur (see <a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/04/542-show-is-over-say-good-bye.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">542 - The Show Is Over, Say Good-Bye</a>).\n\nBoosted saturation with a combination of three Hue/Saturation layers. See <a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/08/683-welcome-to-republic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">683 - Welcome To The Republic</a>. Adjusted by de-saturating reds slightly and by blending a magenta filters in the shadows.\n\nAdded a vignette, levels and sharpening."
