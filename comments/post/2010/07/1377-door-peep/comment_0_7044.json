So I do feel a certain fascination and often get rewarded by paying attention to the doors, especially the most modest ones like those I found in Sri Lanka. But Vienna and next to it Budapest sport an abundance of wonderfully decorated doors that still are life, showing signs of wear and tear and still do not loose their beauty. So I will now lean back and enjoy \"Door Peep\"!"
