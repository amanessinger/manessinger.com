    "content": "Wood was much more plentiful on the North American continent than stone. Forests extended from the east coast to the Mississippi River. So wood was the material of choice for home builders. Today when we want something permanent, it's built of steel and cement, not stone and brick. And the more permanent structures are office buildings, not homes or even factories.\n\nToday, most of the forests are long gone. So wood now comes from the west. What we'll use for building materials when the western wood is gone, I sure don't know. At least some wood is being recycled into plywood and pressed wood."
