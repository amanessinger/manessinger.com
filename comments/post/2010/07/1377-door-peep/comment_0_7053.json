Where I live, on a suburban street in west-central New Jersey, USA, our doors are only a few generic styles and very boring.\n\nIn this image, I love the angle of the light - just perfect for showing all sorts of textures and other interesting details, like the shadows of the wrought iron below the 2nd floor windows."
