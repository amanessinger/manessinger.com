    "content": "These houses are from between 1880 and 1900, I guess. The problem here in Europe is, that so much has been destroyed in WWII. Still, though Vienna was hit hard, it was not nearly as hard as in some German cities. But it's the same in Italy: La Spezia, where we spent the morning in a museum, before we went on to the marble quarries of Carrara, La Spezia was always a military harbor, therefore it was bombed heavily, and the result is, that almost nothing of the historic center remained.\n\nAnd the US? Well, you have another attitude towards houses, towards staying in a place for a lifetime. I just saw images on the Boston Globe blog \"The Big Picture\" of houses in the mid-west hit by tornadoes. It's all wood. It has become fashionable here among the environmentally conscious to build wooden houses, but in general we build with brick and concrete, meaning to build for a lifetime and beyond. Contrastingly, there is much more mobility in the US, and when you don't intend to stay, you probably have less incentive to make your house distinct. You move on anyway."
