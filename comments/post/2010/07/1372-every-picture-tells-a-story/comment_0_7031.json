    "content": "Thanks. Yes, the real problem is the actual image ðŸ™‚\n\nIn order to homogenize a set of images, you really have to twist and coerce every one of them. It was extreme for the walk through \"Tscheppaschlucht\" two years ago. I had made the images for my first book in one afternoon, under greatly varying light conditions, on a walk through this canyon, begun in sunlight, ending in rain, with images taken in different directions relative to the sun. Thus even two images made within a minute could look totally different, have different color temperatures, a different \"glow\", and therefore needed to be brought in line.\n\nIt was not at all difficult last year. \"Urban Dreams II\" had a very loose concept, and I enforced this by using different processing techniques. This time the requirements are not as strict as with my afternoon walk, but I want a more homogeneous look than last year. Or maybe not. We'll see. Without time constraints this may as well change when I first try to assemble an actual sequence and then decide to re-work half of the images ðŸ˜„"
