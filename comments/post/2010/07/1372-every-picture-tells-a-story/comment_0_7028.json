    "content": "Great image Andreas!  Love all the textures, colors and angles!\n\nThere really is no easy way to homogenize the processing for a body of work is there?  One can try and develop a recipe for post-processing but the main ingredient, the underlying image, can add a great deal of variation to the end result.  The process reminds me of the unofficial mantra for the  US Marine Corps : \"Improvise, Adapt, and Overcome\"!.  Or maybe I'm just doing it incorrectly? ðŸ™‚\n\nGood luck with your publication!\nBarry"
