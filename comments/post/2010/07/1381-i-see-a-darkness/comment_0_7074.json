    "content": "I love this post processing interpretation. It makes me feel something more than had you just presented the image plain and straight out of the camera. It makes me want to go see this marvelous scene and lighting and time of night for myself. I feel that the crowd of people - or is this a scene from a play - are having lots of fun and I want in on it!\n\nYour addition of the branches snaking across the building and the poles that some people seem to be using are what made me wonder whether this was  a staged event - or what!"
