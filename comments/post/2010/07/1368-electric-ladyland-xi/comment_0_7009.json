I wish I had more of his POVs, but perhaps more frequent exposure to his ideas will spark some of mine, just as this quoted comment of his has seemed to have sparked yours, Andreas.\n\nI love the irony in this image. My first impulse, tho, would have been to try to move to a POV which eliminated the modern distraction - but you included it. Congratulations for successfully following through with this idea."
