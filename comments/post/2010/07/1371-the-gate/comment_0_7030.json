    "content": "Thanks. I think there is something amazing in our ability to concentrate on parts of a scene, and somehow this is lost when we look at an image. I don't know why. Maybe it's because we see the image as flat and artificial, as unreal. Fact is, at least for me, it's true: I don't see images like I see the real world. \n\nMaybe it's a 2D vs 3D thing. I remember, when I first saw \"Avatar\" in IMAX 3D, I had a similar impression: I did not look at the whole image, I scanned it piece for piece. Of course I do it with images as well, it's only to a lesser degree.\n\nThis kind of processing is sort of a substitute for that diminished ability to isolate detail in 2D space. It's not subtle, I guess it can easily be overdone and one could argue I have so, but I think that it works well here."
