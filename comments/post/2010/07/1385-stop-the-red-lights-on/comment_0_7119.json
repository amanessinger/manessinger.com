Then comes that imposing and rigid metal rod separating us from something red which cries for attention, too, but we can't get far enough around that metal divider to view it further.\n\nThis also gives me the feeling that I have when under an umbrella and it's raining and blowing so much that I can't see where I'm going, even tho I know where I am, lol."
