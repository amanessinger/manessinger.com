    "content": "I really am intrigued by how you've evolved to allow me (that'a a plural me) to grasp a sense of place as opposed to a micro feeling which ignited as your lens explored places. And yet, you continue to frame subjectively so that the story arc is still distinctively yours. It is as if in the past year, you have zoomed out to find how this moment interacts with the assertions of past cultural statements. I sense a greater cultural swirl in your captures. And yet you do it without demanding an ideological position from your audience. This is a new \"period\" for you Andreas... and it's happened so subtly that I was unaware when it started but comparing now to then... it is - not better - but clearly different. You continue to grow."
