In the end, it's probably better if you take your time, relax, and create the book you envisioned. There's something kinda cool about shoving so much work into a small period of time (I procrastinated and did mine in 5 days -- it was a nightmare), but I think the books usually suffer some serious deficiencies in layout, design, and sequencing. Doesn't mean it's not worth participating, but I agree with your decision... because I want to see what you create. ðŸ™‚"
