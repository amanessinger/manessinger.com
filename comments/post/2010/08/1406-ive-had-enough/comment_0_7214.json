    "content": "Argh, I certainly understand your frustration! Problem is, that those odysseys also seem to happen with Canon (or Nikon) service, if you're running out of luck. Which makes things even worse. I still haven't sent in my half-broken Canon lens, and your story certainly doesn't motivate me! But I guess, dissembling a lens yourself is a bit like open heart surgery on the kitchen table...\n\nSo in the end, the customer service of any brand simply has all the leverage they want. One can only hope and pray."
