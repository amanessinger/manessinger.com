    "content": "Thanks all. Regarding brand snobbery, as you may know, I have recently bought the Sigma 8-16, and when I was at the camera shop on Friday, I held the new Sigma 17-50/2.8 in my hands. Wow! It's the same excellent finish, and I can honestly say that these new Sigmas feel like expensive, precision instruments. I definitely own some Nikkors that don't come even close ðŸ™‚"
