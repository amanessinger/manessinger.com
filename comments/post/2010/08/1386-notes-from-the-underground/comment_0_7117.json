    "content": "Andreas, this image brings back memories of a recurrent nightmare I used to have whenever I'd eaten something that disagreed with me! I'm in a car hunting for a parking place. I see an entrance, so drive into it and it leads me down, down and around and then along come some railroad tracks and I can see the ever-descending tunnel disappearing into darkness.\n\nAfter I finally figured out the relationship between this particular dream and my digestive system, I no longer have to experience the dream!\n\nSo when I saw your image, I got goose bumps!\n\nI'm sorry that you're finding out that this image, which you like, had such unpleasant connotations for one particular viewer. But also I'm sitting here laughing at myself. So now I can appreciate the image for its good qualities.\n\nI like that we can see into the distance in the left side, but, our vision blocked by that cement support wall, we can't see where the tracks might lead us."
