But then: that's the tragedy and the source of all capitalism: How can you even try to approach Communism in a world where nobody cares for their neighbors's (or even a communal) flower pot? It's impossible!\n\nBut, you know, I'm a romantic, and the romantic's strength and weakness is to deny reason and reality. In that sense: I wish you a Happy New Year.\n\nHasta la victoria siempre!"
