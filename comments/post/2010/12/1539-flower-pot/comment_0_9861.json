Maybe... maybe this is just another of those distractions which have occurred regularly over the last 600 years - each of which seemed portents of doom, predicting the final crackling of civilization's veneer? \n\nMy money's on the last. Happy New Year... to you, Irene, Michele and your family...  2011 and 2012 will be dramatically more exciting, um, in the best way. \n\nTed"
