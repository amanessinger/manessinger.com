Slush and having to scrape it off of cars and when standing on the curb wanting to cross a street hoping I don't get splashed with slush from a passing vehicle. But your composition is very good, lol.\n\nI liked the bike portrait, too. I think the comparison with the textured in the plastic and those in the snow is very interesting. Neither plastic wrap nor snow is permanent. Yet they have a way of making themselves known to us.."
