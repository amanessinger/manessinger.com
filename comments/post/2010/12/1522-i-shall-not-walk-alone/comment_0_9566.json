    "content": "Your image of the day is almost like a diptych - but an internal diptych due to that pole that separates the one bus from the rest of the image that includes the 2nd bus and the pedestrian. I think that frame works wonderfully well with snow images.\n\nIn the 2nd image with the guy crossing from left to right, the pavements looks icy - and you're further emphasized the slipperiness in my mind by the slant. There are lots of echoes of curves and curvy wedges among the wires at the top and the tire patterns at the bottom. Craig would have fun analyzing this image, lol.\n\nThe 3rd images is so amazing! The pedestrian is practically echoing the silhouette in the flag above him! A great capture."
