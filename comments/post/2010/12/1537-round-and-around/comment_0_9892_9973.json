    "content": "Yup, viewfinders are much worse than they could be. But then, cameras are much cheaper now than they would be with a reasonably magnifying viewfinder. As it is, there is just no optical magnification in the viewfinder. You see it the size it falls on the sensor. Bigger sensor, bigger viewfinder. Magnification would bring another expensive piece of precision optics into the equation and another source of focus errors. I don't believe that it can be made for a reasonable price, at least not as long as we insist on optical viewfinders. And so far I do ðŸ™‚\n\nBut, one more priority for me is a 100% viewfinder. I had considered the D700, but for composing my images, I prefer the smaller 100% on the D300."
