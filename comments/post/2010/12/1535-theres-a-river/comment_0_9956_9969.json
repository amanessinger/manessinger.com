Actually this was the third time that I was there and the first time that I was satisfied by the result. \n\nThe problem with this particular image was, that this was taken at 8 mm (though later cropped), and that I had to point the camera down for the dramatic curve of the bridge. As a result, the verticals in the background off-center were not so vertical at all. Later in Photoshop I have separately corrected the perspective for the far bank of the river, the sky and the reflections. Due to the horizontal layering of the image, it turned out quite convincing though."
