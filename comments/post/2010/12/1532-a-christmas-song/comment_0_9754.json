    "content": "Andreas, you may not be a believer in anything - but science and religion are very very close - they just use different terms for the same concepts. But until we can learn the language of each - as you have done with German and English - then we tend to think that they are far apart.\n\nI also do not like organized religions that try to control us by telling us what to think and what to believe. So I consider myself spiritual, rather than religious. And I try to follow the so-called Golden Rule which is included in all major and minor religions. I think that this is what counts - how each of us has lived our life in relation to other people, animals, plants and the earth. When we shed this earthly shell, then we'll finally learn the truth. I'm sure it'll surprise all of us."
