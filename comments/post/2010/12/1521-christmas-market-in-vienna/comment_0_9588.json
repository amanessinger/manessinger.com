    "content": "Are they permitted to call it a \"Christmas\" Market in Austria? Increasingly the term is forbidden in public places in this country. Recently the Philadelphia government ordered the word Christmas removed from a Christmas Village collection of holiday shops. This weekend I read of the Federal Reserve ordering one of the private banks it regulates to remove all Christmas references. I expect that soon this administration will ban church trucks and busses from public roads.... Then what? A censoring of parochial speech within the automibiels? The regulators are worried that the words will offend the non Christians, particularly the muslim population which appears particularly prone to bring complaint. Sigh... Oh well, it's a phase, right?"
