Basically Topaz Adjust preset \"Spicify\" applied to parts of the image, some local color and contrast manipulations (some would call it \"dodge and burn\" to hide the fact that they do Photoshop), some locally applied color filters, ... , whatever. Perhaps the most drastic adjustments come from Topaz Adjust.\n\nIn the end the image does not look so much different from what the camera captured, only much more vivid and tonally better balanced. It's grunt work ðŸ™‚"
