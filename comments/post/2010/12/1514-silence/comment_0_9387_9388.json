If you want to see something extremely picturesque, consider <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallstatt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hallstatt</a>. It is a beautiful rural place at a lake, and from Vienna you can reach it in less than four hours. Two hours more will bring you on to Salzburg. From Salzburg you could go west to Innsbruck (and then probably on to Germany or Switzerland), or south to my homeland of Carinthia, and from there either to Slovenia or (probably more likely) Italy.\n\nGraz in south-eastern Austria (two hours from Vienna) is a nice city as well, and it's three hours from there to Hallstatt.\n\nHmm ... five days, that's actually pretty short. This could mean 2 days in Vienna and Salzburg each, with a day of travel, either via Hallstatt (rural) or Graz (probably not so much different from Salzburg). Yeah, I guess I would do Vienna, Hallstatt and then Salzburg. \n\nKeep me informed of your decision ðŸ™‚"
