    "content": "Hi Andreas,\n\nLovely shot - I'm a sucker for reflections like this.\n\nI've been experimenting with Photomatix myself, and overall I'm sorta, kinda satisfied.  Lately, I'll do a shot in HDR using Photomatix and, like you, take it into Topaz and fiddle with it a bit more.  The trick is to make it look natural (like your previous post).  Then there are times when you want more out of the shot and it doesn't look natural, but the final result is appealing nevertheless.  It's fun, but it does take time and before you know it you could blow two or three hours on a shot you really had no intention of doing anything with.  \n\nThanks for the post,\nJohn"
