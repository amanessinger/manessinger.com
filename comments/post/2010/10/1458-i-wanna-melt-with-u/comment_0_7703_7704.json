The problem is, they will be attracted by your mighty lens ðŸ™‚\n\nWell, it's a nice toy. There is a lot of lateral CA (the type that you hardly can get rid of), but what it makes to backgrounds, that's pure magic.\n\nNow imagine an upcoming Olympus m4/3 camera, sensor-stabilized, with an F-mount adapter. Imagine it has good high ISO, just as the D300 or even better. This should be in the reach of Oly. That would be a 170/1.4 as regards light, or at least equivalent to 170/2.0 as regards DOF. Stabilized! Can you spell C.O.N.C.E.R.T. L.E.N.S?"
