At first I thought the second was an album cover for your \"Song of the Day\" -- maybe from Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\". ðŸ™‚  Beautifully strong colors, textures, layers and reveals.\n\nYour point of view in creating the first image is brilliant, IMHO, and it's a delight to be brought along for the ride."
