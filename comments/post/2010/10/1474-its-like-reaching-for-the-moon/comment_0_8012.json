I'm sometimes annoyed by powerlines - here, it seems the prettier the location the more likely you are to have a powerstation or at least the lines intersecting the most interesting views.  It just means you have to work harder for the shot you may want.  Or, you can make them part of it, like you've done here.  Nice!\n\nJohn"
