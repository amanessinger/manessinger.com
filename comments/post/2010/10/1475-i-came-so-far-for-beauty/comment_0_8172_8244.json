Modern trains lack the curtains the compartments had it earlier times, thus even when you turn off the lights, there are always the lights from the corridor. You can't dim them down, so forget about any images taken through a train's windows at dusk. But even when it's reasonably bright outside, there are still reflections from inside lights. Our mind is pretty effective at canceling them out, but the camera can't, and so the reflections invariably show up in your images.\n\nOne way to get around that, is to hold the lens flush to the glass. This obviously avoids reflections, but the price is the total loss of any choice of perspective. But then, yes, I probably should do that sometimes and just see what happens. Thanks for the inspiration!"
