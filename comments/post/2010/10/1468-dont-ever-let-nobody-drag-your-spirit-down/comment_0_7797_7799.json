    "content": "Oh, I have the CD and have ripped it myself. No idea if it's available via iTunes. I don't use it. It's a closed ecosystem as everything from Apple. In order to buy their music, I have to install iTunes, but iTunes won't play most of my music, that I have ripped from my own CDs to OGG format. As regards my needs, iTunes is severely crippled software. They don't like my music, I don't like theirs ðŸ™‚"
