I didn't want to change, but after having to use Chrome for a very nice wee website (http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/ - worth a look if you've got time), I have to say I'm hooked and haven't gone back. Sure, there are some extensions I have to fire up Firefox for, but for the most part - Chrome is my browser. It just seems slicker and somehow easier."
