You had only less than a minute before the light would change and then this scene would have broken up into hustle and bustle. So you caught a magical moment - a pause between actions and decisions. \n\nWonder whether any of those people appreciated this forced pause in their activity? Did some of them \"foam at the mouth\" to get going again? What did they use this suspended minute in time for - resting one's body, resting one's brain - or worrying, stewing about things still to be done?"
