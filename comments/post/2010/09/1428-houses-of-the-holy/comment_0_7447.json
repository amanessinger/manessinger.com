    "content": "Wow a very modern and striking architectural design for a church.  I too like the dark colors and materials. My first thoughts were, \"back in the womb.\"  Churches and the concept of rebirth are certainly not strangers to one another. Just first impressions. \n\nOn stabilization at this range of zoom lens, this shot obviously proves it can be very useful. However, at this length I consider it to be a great convenience but certainly less \"needed/required\" then on longer focal lengths.  Perhaps this qualifies me for a hard knock...but I doubt the reboot results would be any better. ðŸ™‚"
