It's not often I'll look up the X2 size of your image and examine it, but today, I enjoyed digesting this scene.\n\nThe building on the right seems quite bright, considering it is fully shaded. If it was brightened up, how did you do this? There's very little noise there, something I always suffer from if I try and brighten up shady areas."
