I use that button on my D300 to zoom in also... but I don't do it so often that I couldn't live without it.\n\nI'm curious about the D7000 in that maybe it could replace my D200 for event photography.  But that's a pretty low priority for me, and I doubt I'll spend the money as I have other things I need to fix first."
