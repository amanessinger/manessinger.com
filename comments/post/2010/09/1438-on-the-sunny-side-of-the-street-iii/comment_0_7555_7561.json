Fact is, film burns out much more gracefully than digital, but you have more problems getting detail in the shadows.\n\nWhen I do images like this one, there's always a lot of Photoshop manipulation involved. Basically the trick is, to re-distribute contrasts, but without making the image flat. This often means to do certain things only locally. An example is the rim light on the woman. I have accentuated it only locally. This won't help you with film though. Sorry, that's one area where I have no experience at all."
