Probably then there would have been something else in the way, lol.\n\nSo how about flipping it horizontally? Perhaps you'd like that tree better as a visual stop at the right side? But then that would make the light seem to come from the right, and I like it better coming from the left. Oh what to do, lol?\n\nI like this image anyway, big tree or no. I love the quality of the light and how the light in the background forms an opposite diagonal to the slight diagonal of the twigs in the foreground."
