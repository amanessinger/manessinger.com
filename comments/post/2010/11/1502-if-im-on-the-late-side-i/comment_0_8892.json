However I feel that one of the things that you are doing is presenting a collection of bicycles.  As a collection I feel that they are very interesting..and in the context of that collection...this photo is more interesting.  From my perspective you never need to apologize for publishing your bicycle photos.  They are great.\n\n-Jim-"
