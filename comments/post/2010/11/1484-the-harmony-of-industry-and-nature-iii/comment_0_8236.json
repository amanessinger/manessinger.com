    "content": "Oh, Andreas, how much you sound like a kid in a toy store! I too was mesmerized by the iPad - but - well, all the \"buts\" that you stated applied to my thinking, except, even tho Apple has some business practices that I don't like, I've always had Apple computers. They are so much easier for me to figure out and use than pcs running Windows. \n\nI think Microsoft is even stinkier in their policies than Apple.  And furthermore, their browsers get attacked all the time. With Apple I don't have to worry about hackers - they just aren't interested. Microsoft is also very short-sighted about what customers want - I've had a WebTV/MSN-TV since 1996, before Microsoft bought and ruined it. But that's another story for another day.\n\nAs for Linux, I've never used it as a browser, but my host server runs Linux - don't remember the version, tho. But the server is controlled by a great scripter who knows absolutely what he's doing. We've never been hacked and have never had any problems that were server based. Upstream, yes, but only twice in 6 years.\n\nOh, you did post an image, right! It's so nice and warm and glowy - but I'm sure the fog was due to some sort of chill in the air, lol. It does look warm and cozy, tho."
