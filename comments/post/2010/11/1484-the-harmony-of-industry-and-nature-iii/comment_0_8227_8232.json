    "content": "Well, yeah, but it is still a little too inconvenient. Ideally it would be a netbook like the new Sony VAIO P (probably neither in pink, nor orange, nor green). It is really, really expensive, but it weighs about the same as the iPad, has 2GB memory and an orientation sensor, i.e the screen rotates, although the screen format in portrait mode is only for portraits of very slim people ðŸ˜„ \n\nIt comes with Windows 7 though (would be no problem), but of course it has no touchscreen. And really, a touchscreen is an incredibly nice UI for browsing and image viewing. A touchpad does not even remotely come close.\n\nAs it is, well, it costs four times the price for the same CPU, twice the memory and half the weight. Hmm ... \"half\", \"twice\", in a way that may even be worth a factor four, especially given the much higher screen resolution. But anyway, the Sony, apart from the fact that I didn't even know it exists, was quite over the budget, that I was willing to spend on an experiment."
