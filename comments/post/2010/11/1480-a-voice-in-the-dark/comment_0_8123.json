    "content": "Andreas,\nYou mention the D7000 - are you using that now? \nAh, the DX/FX conundrum.  For most of us, it's easy - can't afford FX.  But then there's the issue of lugability; much easier to carry around a DX camera for hours than FX. Still, whenever I see a photo from a full-frame camera there just seems to be a different 'feel' to it.  Sorry I can't be more specific, but it seems to be true for me.  The thing is, if you were to place two shots of the same subject next to each other, one from the D300 and the other from a D3 or D700 and not say which is which, could you tell the difference.  I doubt it, but when I'm looking at a shot and subsequently find out it's fullframe, I feel a little ah-ha! moment, as if I kind of suspected it.\nFor me, if money were no obstacle I'd go FX.  Since it is, it looks like I'll be going the D7000 route next year.\nJohn"
