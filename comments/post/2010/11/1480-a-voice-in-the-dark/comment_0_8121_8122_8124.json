It's standalone and not bound to a certain Photoshop version like Camera RAW. Adobe distributes it in a bundle together with Camera RAW, and I remember having seen some batch importers (camera or card to file system), that support running the converter automatically upon import.\n\nAs far as image quality goes, I don't think I can see any noise in my D300's images as long as I have exposed properly. Of course, you know what I do to pixels, when I begin with extreme processing in Photoshop, I frequently unearth noise, even in images taken at base ISO. But that's normal: as soon as you begin rising shadows, you are amplifying the signal, and that's not different from what raising ISO in-camera does."
