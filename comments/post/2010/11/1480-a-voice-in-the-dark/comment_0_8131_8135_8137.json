With my stable of lenses I doubt I will shift, even though at times I was temped.\n\nAs for image quality, Nikon DSLR images have a certain look (again hard to quantify) that seem to be vibrant where the Canon files seem to be neutral.  The 7D files in the today's testing seemed to lean towards the Nikon spectrum, so maybe Canon is juicing it up a bit to meet the comp.  I went ahead and processed the files down to the size I share and post (10\" W  long side at 96 PPI) and all the noise and stuff that worries photogs disappeared.  The rich colors on the 7D images stayed in place.  I now have some equipment rethinking to do for my landscape work.\n\nOne last comment, if you haven't tried the pro Nikon glass, see if you can rent a lens of your usual working range for a few days when you have time to work with it.  Your eye will tell you if the 3x factor in money is worth it to you."
