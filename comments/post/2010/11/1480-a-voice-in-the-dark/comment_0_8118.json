    "content": "Can't speak for the 5D MII, but the files from my 5D MI are better than those from my 7D.  Easier to work with and for the lack of a proper word, lush in comparison.  I toyed with the idea of selling the 5D when I got the 7D as a retirement gift, but after seeing the files from it I couldn't.  What I find is that I use the body best suited for the purpose, 5D for landscape/portraits and the 7D for action/wildlife.  Unless one sees the files from both cameras on a good large monitor, I doubt anyone could see the difference.    \nGiven my vintage, IS (VC) is a must on my general purpose lenses.  I opted for the 24-105 f/4.0 IS when purchasing the 5D and use a EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS on the 7D.  After seeing images using Canon's pro glass I was spoiled."
