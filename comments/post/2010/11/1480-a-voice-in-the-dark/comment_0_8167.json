You have yellow and blue, orange and blue, magenta and green - and there's even a hint of purple in the lighted area in the right. I like how the street curves away to the right. I want to go there to see what's to be seen next. I like how the shadows at the bottom ground the image, and how the tree puts a protective canopy over the rest of the scene."
