    "content": "Andreas,  noise is a large part of it and I often find I have to use Canon's DPP software to get a 7D image acceptable for both noise and sharpness.  In all fairness to the 7D I most often use it at higher ISO than the 5D to keep the exposure time as fast as possible.  I will do a side by side comparison using a subject that I would normally use the 5D for and see if my statement is still valid.  Will let you know the outcome.  It does help some to set the 7D to record a medium raw file to mimic the 5D 12 mpx.   \nNow that I think it through, there are two other issues that are not the fault of the 7D.  First and foremost since wildlife is often done at distance it normally requires extensive crops.  50-60% is not uncommon and presents challenges and takes time to keep the image clean.  I rarely crop a 5D file and often do not have to do NR or sharpening.  Second is my fault in not upgrading my software and the 7D is not supported in PS CS3.  This requires me to start in Lightroom with the raw and then save it in DNG to port over to CS3.\nI feel Nikon made the right call at limiting most of their bodies to 12 mpx, especially in the DX line.\nI am not disappointed with the 7D as it gets me images that would be impossible with the 5D because of the much better AF, FPS and wonderful shutter release.  Very much like the 1D MII I had for the same type of photography."
