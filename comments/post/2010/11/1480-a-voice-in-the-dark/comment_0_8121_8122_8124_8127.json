After I posted my reply I got in the shower (why do so many good thoughts come while in the shower) and remember I had installed it and then forgot about it when LR started supporting the 7D.  It is also available as a stand-alone download.  I will now start using it.\n\nAnd when one starts messing with noise then the sharpness go to pot.  Except that I have noticed the NR in Canon's DPP doesn't soften the image as much as LR or PS.\n\nI see John mentioned \"feel\" with FX images and with my experience he is correct.  Very hard to find an adequate description.  If I were thinking about a new body I would look for the largest dimensioned photosites/pixel I could afford and make FX/DX and # of MP secondary considerations.  Probably most important is ergonomics."
