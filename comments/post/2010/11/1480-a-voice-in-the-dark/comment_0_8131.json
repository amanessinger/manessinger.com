    "content": "Ok I made a side by side with the 5D and 7D and it created more questions than answers.  But, Andreas thank you for bringing up the question of DX vs. FX.  I learned a lot about how the 7D 'sees'.  In short, all settings were the same and I used the same lens on both bodies (24-105 f/4L IS) with adjustment for crop factor.  The workflow was identical, except to get the image dimensions the same.  I noticed that cramming 18 MP of info in a 12 MP space heightened the noise in areas of solid color and created a file that was 14.9% larger.  1/3 the frame was clear blue sky and just to rub it in the temp was a nice 75 F (23.9 C).  The 5D file was cleaner, flatter in color and more even on the histogram.  The 7D file was darker, richer in color and the histogram made a large step up at about 1-1/2 stops down from highlight end.  It seems there is a highlight priority built into the processor/firmware that is not user programable, as I have highlight priority disabled in menu.  As a bit of an aside I also made an image at the MRAW (approx. 10.1 MP) setting and it came out nearly as clean as the 5D file.\n\nMy thoughts at the moment are get which ever body you want for the features and learn how the meter/sensor sees.  Buy the best glass you can afford and disregard the rest of it."
