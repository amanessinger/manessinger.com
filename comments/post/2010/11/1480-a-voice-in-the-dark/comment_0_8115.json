    "content": "You make some very sensible and practical points about camera bodies. Over the last year I've formed the opinion that for most of my needs, both my GF1 and 5D MkII will provide good enough quality. That's great because I end up carrying my GF1 around more and because of it I make far more satisfying pictures than I ever did when I used film. However, I don't want to give up my FX body and it's expensive lenses. I'm sure that a large proportion of that decision is based around emotion rather than practicability. I came to FX from owning and using  pro standard large and medium format so it was a natural migration. No, most of the time it doesn't produce better images, and yes it is more flexible with it's TS-e lenses some of the time. The biggest reason for ownership though is that I like it! I'm sure that I would be satisfied with a 7D if it was the only choice though I would rue the fact that my 24mm lens wasn't so wide."
