Working with a Canon or another non-Nikon camera, I'd have to un-learn what my body knows, and then learn the new camera. Makes me shudder ðŸ™‚\n\nAs regards image quality, I suppose as long as you don't print extremely big and look from close, the differences between modern DSLRs are negligible. Heck, with good light even compacts are acceptable. And that's a good thing. After all, cameras are mostly for taking pictures, not for worrying about image quality. At least they say so ðŸ˜„"
