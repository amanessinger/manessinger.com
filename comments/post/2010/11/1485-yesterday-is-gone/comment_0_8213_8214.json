    "content": "Thanks. Actually the image suffered from inadequate framing, but I may have gone over the top with that ðŸ˜„\n\nColor-wise it's mostly the sky that I've enhanced. I had used a polarizer, and due to the wide angle, the darkening of the sky was not even. I could have polarized less, but the color contrast at full polarization was real nice. There were other defects like a strong perspective distortion due to me shooting upwards with a wide angle, thus I had to stretch the lower left corner strongly down, and that impacted texture quality. The actual processing with the strong burning from the edges inward is mostly an attempt to fight these defects."
