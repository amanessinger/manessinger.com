The other problem with ISO-based profiles is, that ISO as recorded in the meta data does not tell that much about the actual noise reduction needs. A high-contrast night shot is different from a twilight shot with sky, and it so much depends on where your information is. In difficult situations I tend to use \"Select Color Range\"-based masks, for instance to restrict smudging over details to the sky. In the end though, I think noise reduction algorithms are as good as their ability to detect edges within random noise. That's something that the Topaz products do very well."
