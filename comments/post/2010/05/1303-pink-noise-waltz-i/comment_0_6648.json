Unfortunately, I noticed that we never received a response from our original invitation to join our affiliate program.\n\n What separates the B&amp;H affiliate program from other affiliate arrangements is our ability to assign a personal relationship manager who can answer all of your questions and coach you along the way to greater success.\n\n We are still very interested in discussing the ways in which we can help you provide additional value to your site audience and further monetize your site. Please feel free to contact me with any additional questions that you may have.\n\n Best regards,\n     \n      Yechiel \n\n » Click here to sign up for B&amp;H affiliate program \nhttp://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/affiliates.jsp\n\n » Click here to view bhphotovideo.com \nhttp://www.bhphotovideo.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYechiel Orgel \nOnline Marketing Analyst \nBH PHOTO VIDEO  \n212 239 7500 ext 2785\nyechielo@bhphotovideo.com"
