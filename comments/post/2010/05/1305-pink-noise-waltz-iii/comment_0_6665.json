    "content": "I'm a Neat Image user. NI works in lots of dimensions simultaneously: spatial frequency, colour channel and tonal value. this means you can tune it (even in auto mode) to work on only the dark, even areas and largely ignore the others if you want. Or maybe work on only the flat areas (low spatial frequency) and igonre the detailed bits. And so on.\n\nIt has lots of controls which take some time to learn if you want fine tuning but the auto tuning is good for 99% of images and the profile builder is easy to use, too. Haven't used the very latest version but I think it's excellent."
