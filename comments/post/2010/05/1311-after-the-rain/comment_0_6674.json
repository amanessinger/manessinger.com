    "content": "I agree with Marcus. When using HDR for a landscape that's supposed to look natural, this is the way to do it. But sometimes a fun application of HDR is nice to produce a poster-like effect or some surrealistic type of colors and drawing. Depends on the subject and the intended end use.\n\nAndreas, I love the details of the grasses and flowers in the foreground. I would have thought that you had shot 2-3 images, each with a different focus, and then combined them. Can you do this when shooting specifically for HDR - include the focus differences, too? How would the software handle this?"
