These latter I think are esp powerful - they lead me into the scene and make me want to know more about what's along the way in the out-of-focus distance.\n\nAs for copyright laws, it's sure be nice if the whole world could come together with some sort of unified agreement - and then we'd know where we stand. Only a lawyer may be able to figure out US copyright laws!"
