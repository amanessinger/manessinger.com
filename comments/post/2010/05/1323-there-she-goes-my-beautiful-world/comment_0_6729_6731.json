    "content": "Yeah, but isn't that a strange thing? Here we have a big corpus of law that nobody understands, that is seen as one of the most important areas for modern societies, and when it clashes with reality, it is widely ignored. \n\nThe phenomenon really amazes me. I mean, how long can you hold up laws against a vast majority of your people? How damaging is it for an industry (and for the law system as well), when mothers are brought to court for 24 songs that they or their children did or did not download? How damaging is it for an industry, when they seek statutory damages of $1.92 million for 24 songs and how damaging is it for the law system when that amount is granted? How long can you govern for the industry and against the people? And what happens when they still ignore you?\n\nThat's the reason why we see lawmakers around the world feverishly trying to use child porn as an excuse to establish a completely undemocratic content filtering and censorship system for the Internet. Some people even swallow it, some always do, but in the meanwhile majorities are hard to be found, and that although the establishe media, struggling with loss of reach as well, help to spread the propaganda.\n\nInteresting times indeed, and the general loss of credibility of the ruling establishment, induced by the financial crisis, does not help either."
