    "content": "Andreas, thanks for writing clearly on how you feel about governments and transparency. \n\nFor me it is becoming more and more apparent that significant new problems in the so-called digital era arise from (political or any other) speech getting increasingly detached from reality, either by intention or by inability to understand how things work. \n\nOf course this getting-detached-from-reality aspect of (political) speech has existed as long as politics has existed, as demonstrated by the classic (e.g., Greek and Roman) art of getting people do what you want them to do via rhetoric. \n\nBut in the current digitalized reality the ability to understand how (digital) things work is not easy to gain, and if citizens are uneducated, then they can be made to agree to things which can be extremely harmful to the society and to the people, with global implications.\n\nBut is it possible to teach (at least to the young people) thinking which can tackle issues of a rather novel type, never before faced in the history of mankind? I hope so, but I also fear that our society is becoming too much pleasure-seeking, too much geared to individual success stories to care about the \"big picture\" or questions such as \"who has the real power in the digital world\"."
