    "content": "Every halfway intelligent and clear-sighted person must agree with your diagnosis about the actual \"development\" - rather retogression - of the society in  many respects since approximately the middle of the eighties.  I am getting the feeling, a kind of \"Biedermeier\" escalates, but \"fortunately\" we simple citizen can feel absolutely \"safe\", thanks to the permanent monitoring by so wonder- and helpful organisations, like NSA, CIA, BND, BVT, AbwA, HNaA and others worlwide.\n\nSome humans with aerials for the future have anticipated the (our ?) future, as can been found in distopian novels, as Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" (1931), George Orwell's  \"Ninety Eighty-Four\"(1948), Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\"(1953) and Anthony Burgess \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1962)."
