    "content": "Interesting thoughts. I read Duong's article and found it interesting mainly because my experience with both the OM-D and the NEX cameras amount to a similar conclusion but I would have put it much more simply. For me, as much as I want to like it, the OM-D simply does not feel right when I hold it and feels completely wrong when I use it. The exact opposite is true for any of the NEX cameras.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that I don't know why I want to like the OM-D in the first place. I'm not one to care much about the gear; I don't even care much about lenses since the technicalities that make a lens great are not the things that I look for in a photograph.\n\nAs you've concluded, in the end it's up to each of us to understand our own needs; horses for courses as it were."
