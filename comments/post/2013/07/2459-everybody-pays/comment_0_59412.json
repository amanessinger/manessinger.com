Nobel-Lauriate Obama, is little better than our dismal George Bush (both of 'em) in protecting anyone from the We-Can-Do-It-So-Why-Not? psychosis of Big Government hubris. All of these characters seem to believe that as long as they are in the saddle that they can control the rampaging beast to ride the path of goodness as they imagine it. Of course they can't, won't, and don't. And when we discover that our George Bush or Barack Obama's are either fools or knaves... we become just a hair more cynical. Pity... Because cynics are the easiest for the beast to corral and herd. What we must become are skeptics. Cynics ignore facts, skeptics navigate by them. Which is why emotional arguments rule cynics, while the skeptics are fueled by the rational. We need more Spocks and fewer James T. Kirks. Not just here in America BTW... Just as you appear to feel pity for America, I gotta' admit that there's a lot to go around for the populations of most of the EU as well. Sigh..."
