Photographs like this captivate me; my imagination mixes with my memories and I'm off on a ride through time and space.\n\nAs for your sentiment, I know what you mean. In Brisbane, developers must propose and build a park with any new housing development and they invariably choose the worst bit of land, often quite small and always placed in an area to exactly conducive to making parents feel comfortable about letting their children play there. In the end they remain mostly empty and become just one more patch of grass for the local Council to maintain."
