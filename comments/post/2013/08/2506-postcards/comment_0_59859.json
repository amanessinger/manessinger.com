You're lucky living where you do in that you don't have to pay a tax to leave your country (i.e. negotiate a tunnel!). I guess I'm a bit ignorant on these matters but until now the word \"Croatia\" has for me conjured up nightmare images of war. I'll have to blame myself and perhaps our media for that. I'm glad it's not so."
