    "content": "Andreas,\n\nNice pictures from that lens. The 9-18 has been tempting my for some time now. I like the idea of super wide, especially in a small package. My 12-50 is pretty wide too, so I keep thinking, the extra 3mm may not add much extra, or does it? Thinking in terms of 35mm equivalent (as most of us do) that really is 6mm of difference.... still not that big of a difference.\n\nWhat I think I would really like is a super wide prime. I have the 20mm and that is only a bit on the wide but I love the size and the image quality. The Oly 12mm is tempting but a bit pricey for me. The Pany 14 is not really wide enough and has not had great reviews. Not interested in fisheye. So...\n\nMaybe I should just be happy with what I already have."
