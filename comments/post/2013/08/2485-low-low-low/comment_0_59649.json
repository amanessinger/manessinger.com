    "content": "Andreas, I've enjoyed following your recent thoughts and impressions of different lens for the Olympus.  This image is a very creative use of the both the width and DOF this particular lens and camera offers.  I also have the Olympus 9-18 and find it a fun lens to use with the OM-D. \n\nPerhaps not everyone would weigh the merits of a \"fun factor\" but it ought to be a part of everyone's selection process -- if it's not fun to use you're not likely going to use it much."
