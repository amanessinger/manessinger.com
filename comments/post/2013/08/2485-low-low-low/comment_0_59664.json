The \"fun factor\" (along with portability) will always trump quality for me. I'm sure my view would be different if I was dependent on my photography for a living but since that is not the case, fun rules.\n\nThis particular shot is engaging. The ground level viewpoint creates a lot of impact, especially with the pattern on the carpet. Very cool."
