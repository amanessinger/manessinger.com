    "content": "George Orwell's \"1984\" showed us only too well the power that implied danger has over people who are by nature fearful. It makes it so easy for the few to control the many. The so called \"war on terror\" is perfect for this kind of activity; how to erode basic liberties and rights without anyone complaining. Even religion with its threat of hell (or its equivalent in what ever religion we pick) has a lot to answer for."
