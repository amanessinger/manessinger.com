    "content": "As Frank Herbert said in the immortal \"Dune\", \"Fear is the mindkiller\".  More often than not I completely forget what I've read, but that quote has been forever burned into my brain.  And it's especially true today.  With today's social media, fear can be spread almost instantaneously.  Just read social sites like \"The Drudge\" or \"The Blaze\".  Talk about paranoia.  Buy your guns and trust no one!\n\nAs Cedric points out, this makes it very easy for the few (dare I say the \"1%\" without risking Paul's wrath?) to keep the many on the straight and narrow.  The irony is overwhelming.  People are made to believe that they're protecting their own interests when, in fact, they're doing everything but that."
