    "content": "I must say I feel much the same way. Where you researched music I researched art. And you are right, asking question is out of fashion and so is critical thinking. Today it is easy to feel small and insignificant, to feel like we know nothing and that the world is passing us by. The Internet's power might be seen as bringing information to the people but it is more likely that it is bringing mob-mentality to information. All that knowledge at our finger tips and yet no way of knowing its validity but that doesn't matter does it, it's all about hits and views. With a great headline who cares about the content?\nMy son's math class in his last year at school was what I learned in my second year at University. My daughter, 4 years younger, was given an assignment which my son did only last year. Where does it end?\nI do not know where the answers to our woes lie. I have not found them in art or philosophy beyond the personal level but then again, maybe that's all the answers we can ever expect to find. I don't know."
