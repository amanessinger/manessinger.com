There will always be bias in knowledge but it is better to have access to the information than not. However when access comes so easily there is always a risk that it is simply believed without question, without analysis. When things become easy, people become lazy (and yes I am generalising ðŸ™‚ ).\n\nAs for the sustainability of learn more and more knowledge, I do not know. I can say though that it surprises me how easily my 17yro son learned what I had once been taught in a Pure Mathematics class in second year University. Perhaps our brains are evolving in ways that will help us cope or perhaps some of the new research happening with DNA which seems to indicate that ancestral memories may be stored in DNA strands might help us find ways of accessing that information. I'm guessing and fantasising. Maybe as you suggest, we will simply lose interest in those topics that take simply too long to learn. I really have no idea.\n\nYou've certainly raised some interesting thoughts."
