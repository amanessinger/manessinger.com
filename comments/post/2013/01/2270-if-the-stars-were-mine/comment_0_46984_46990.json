    "content": "No, I strongly feel that the Internet is vast progress over what we (not) had. I can't check the validity of everything that I read in Wikipedia, but there are a few things that I know, and when I look them up, I can find what I know, plus an immensity of what seems plausible in the context of what I know.\n\nSure, much of Wikipedia's content must be biased, but so were the big encyclopedias of the past. Only that I didn't have them for financial reasons, and if I had had them, I couldn't have used them to look up the publishing year of my Song of the Day ðŸ™‚\n\nSome disciplines must really suffer today though. Look at physics: You can easily understand apples and stones, it took a genius and enormous doubt of the scientific community to come to grips with relativity, but quantum physics? Particles? Strings? Yes, we pump money into those disciplines, but at one point it will be hard to get people interested at all. I suppose it takes a long time today until you understand enough of it to even judge whether you are interested in a career in physics or not. It's maybe not a problem of today, but once you need years of education until you get even in sight of where the bleeding edge is, the productivity of science must slow down terribly. Or its quality and credibility must suffer. Or likely both ðŸ™‚"
