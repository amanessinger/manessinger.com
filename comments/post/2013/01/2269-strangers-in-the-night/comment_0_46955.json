    "content": "I think words do matter, and even though one word does little, more of them do have the power to change thinking, and thus also behaviour.\n\nIn Finland the President traditionally makes a New Year's speech on tv, and this year there was an interesting new word in the speech, \"residency society\" (in Finnish, oleskeluyhteiskunta), in the context of \"we can not afford a residency society\", meaning that each and everyone must work to support the society, to keep up the economic growth and the global competitiviness of Finland. \n\nThis raises the question of whether all human beings are equal, or should all be judged by their ability to work. And this brings to mind The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the points noted there about rights and responsibilities of each person. \n\nI feel that the society should recognize also other values than just striving for economic growth, but in Finland the big thing seems to be competitiviness, competitiviness, competitiviness, and everything else is secondary, such as education, culture, or health care.\n\n(In the English <a href=\"http://www.tpk.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=266194&amp;nodeid=44807&amp;culture=en-US\" rel=\"nofollow\">press release</a> about the speech the translation of the word \"oleskeluyhteiskunta\" was \"a society in which one can merely exist\".)"
