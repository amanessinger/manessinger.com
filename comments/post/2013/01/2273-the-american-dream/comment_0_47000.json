    "content": "Sorry, Andreas, but what a bunch of anti-American sentiment that is.  From my point of view, as an American who has worked hard, despite prejudice, racism, and other manner of social ills to have some manner of success, I find this rather offensive; however, you are entitled to your own opinion, for sure. But, it is an opinion, probably based on news reports, etc, of what you believe America to be about. Not to worry, soon it will be bankrupt like Europe as more and more people start to ride on that \"gravy train\" that \"the rich\" are supposed to pay for. I'm not rich, but neither am I exactly poor. I made decisions to go to school and keep the straight and narrow. I lived in the \"hood\", watched friends get hooked on drugs, and go to jail, so I didn't grow up in a rich, or even middle class neighborhood.\n\nI believe in helping those in need, but also believe in earning your keep and that there will always be strata and that socialism/communism does nothing to help people, only hinders them. I know several people who are milking the system and it is disgusting, especially with the assistance and opportunities available to those who want to work for it.\n\nAlso, for everything to be well, who says that you have to be a millionaire?"
