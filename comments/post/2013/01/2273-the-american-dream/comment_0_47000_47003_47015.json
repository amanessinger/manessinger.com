    "content": "During the recent presidential election, I was curious, so I read Marx's Communist Manifesto and found it, as you guessed, appalling.  The huge fault that I see with Communism is in that it completely removes any will of anyone to do better. There is no point in doing better. There is no point in excelling. It's very similar to the unions. Just do your time. Collect your money.\n\nThis whole idea of class warfare, us against them, the rich against the poor, the widening gap of rich/poor is, I believe, nothing but \"spin\" put forth by those who are not well meaning, simply envious.\n\nDo I think a completely market based economy, pure capitalism, similar to what Ayn Rand spoke of in her book, will work? Probably, for a while, but in the end, some governmental agency would need to step in and take control, which is why we have government oversight, anti-monopoly legislation, etc, to try to keep the market somewhat free, but prevented from taking too much advantage of the individual.\n\nAndreas, certainly, you and I were raised in different cultures. I was raised to get an education, work hard/ work smart, manage my money, and be accountable for the choices that I made. This, too, is how I raised my children. Were we communists, from what I understand, there would be no point in this. They'd get something for nothing as part of the collective; however, as long as money is involved, who's there to earn it? There's no one to give a crap.\n\nIf you want to talk about corruption, all you need to do is look at the various communist regimes that tried to survive and you'll find a very small percentage that were exceptionally rich, while the masses were exceptionally poor. At least with capitalism, everyone, and I mean everyone, has the opportunity to do better."
