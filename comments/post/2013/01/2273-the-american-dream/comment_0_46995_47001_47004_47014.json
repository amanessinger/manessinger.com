    "content": "My response would be, why not? You have producers and consumers. You have job providers and workers. If a worker agrees to work for a given wage, all is fair. Why should he/she get more than they bargained for. Further, if a given worker should decide to go it on his own, make more money, take more risks, why is it that those who don't want to take that risk should have the right and ability to take what someone else has. I just see no sense in it whatsoever. Some might look at it as altruism, I look at it as envy and coveting. Period."
