I wonder why there is no standard filter that you just apply. We have dozens of useless sepia filters, but why not something like that? Give it a distance slider and a haze density adjustment and that must be it. Or maybe not?\n\nActually what I did is certainly not a correct reversal of the modification the atmosphere applies to light. It's a good looking fake, but still, I can't really figure out why the process should not be reversible, at least under the approximation that we look at something more or less flat."
