Software programs (and cameras) are becoming incredibly smart and I can see the day when post-processing will simply be a button push, Instagram style. Wellâ€¦ speaking for myself ðŸ˜‰ As it is I am doing less and less processing in Photoshop. With LR, it might not be a button push but it's getting close for some of the shots I take.\n\nI also concur with your view of sepia filters. Does anyone ever use those?!"
