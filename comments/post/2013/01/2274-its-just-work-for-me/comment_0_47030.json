Your last few posts have certainly kept me engaged.\n\nI too feel like we are standing on the edge of something new but perhaps we are only at the beginning of the end of the something old. We may well have quite some distance to go before any one comes up with new ideas and methods and even further to go before there is enough people around to see the sense in those ideas. As someone I knew once used to say: evolution only comes after revolution."
