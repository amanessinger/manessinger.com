Until about one year ago I liked my day job enough that I didn't need to view photography in that way but a lot has changed since, not only in my work place and my industry but also within myself. I find that I go to work each day more out of necessity than desire now, which is quite foreign for me. I have to say that I'm grateful that I have photography. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's a life saver but it's definitely a sanity saver."
