The foreground may be the feeling... the idea... the point... or.. no, it may be the mood, the setting, the proposition. I hesitate to write, \"as usual\" when thinking about your artwork Andreas... it seems as if I'm dismissing your work as formulaic when it is nothing if not... \n\nBut here I've got to write, \"as usual, you've stimulated my imagination with yours.\" You see life through frames in a way that continually intrigues and moves. This jagged foreground in such tack-sharp... no, make that shard-sharp... focus is part of a continuum within the borders and what they frame becomes, well the frame to this proposition. Yeah, that's it, you've framed the foreground with ordinariness of the world, making it all seem brittle and temporary in it's  unchallenging routine. Boredom shattered.\n\nLove it man."
