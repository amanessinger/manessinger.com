    "content": "Markets are making a big comeback in Australia, especially farmer's markets. There's also community gardens popping up in a few places which are also popular. I am not sure if they are making an impact on large stores but I suspect maybe yes because the larger ones have introduced new advertising campaigns and sections of \"farm fresh\" foods picked specifically from local farms etc.\nI prefer the small shops and the markets. Trouble is that you do end up paying a premium, especially at markets. The small delicatessens, butchers and fruit and vegetable shops are good value once you become a regular as they then start to look after you. One thing for sure, even if it does cost more, the quality is far higher. So much so that my kids can always tell the difference even when I don't tell them.\nBut for me, one of the big drivers for using privately owned stores and markets is the shopping experience. It is much more pleasant than the soulless experience one gets at large corporate chains."
