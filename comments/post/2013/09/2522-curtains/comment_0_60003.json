    "content": "What sets my mind at ease when I become attached to the idea that I need APS-C or FF instead of my m4/3 system is reminding myself of the end output and use of my photographs. For the past three years I print only 5X7 color prints and occasionally create an Apple iBook. There is not much need for a larger sensor camera in my situation. I do admit I am infatuated with the latest and greatest but there will always be something new around the corner. I own and ride four bicycles and a friend asked  \"How many is enough?\" The answer of course is one more than I currently have!"
