Many years ago as a teenager, I argued, as part of an assignment, that if a bird built a nest or termites built huge mounds and this was called \"nature\" then, men constructing buildings was also nature. My teacher failed me saying that man-made objects were not part of nature. He went as far as to say that man himself was above nature and therefor not part of it. I've heard that said by others since but never understood that point of view, especially the part about putting man above and separate from nature. We are no more exempt from natural laws than a leaf on a tree as far as I know.\nThanks for the post Andreas."
