    "content": "I switched from Firefox to Chrome last year, due to stability problems, and version updates which seemed to cause compatibility problems. I have been happy with Chrome, but maybe Firefox has matured since then. Anyway, it is good to have working alternatives. Memory consumption is a worry, as all my computers start to be quite old.\n\nFeedly has proved to be a good alternative to Reader, I'm happy with it so far.\n\nOne worry is the potential hazzle the service-providers can cause to users by their actions. Recently my Twitter account got suspended for some strange reason, and it took three days to re-gain access. No explanation was provided by Twitter why they suspended the account. I guess some automatic system of theirs decided I'm have too subversive opinions to be allowed to use Twitter. ;-)"
