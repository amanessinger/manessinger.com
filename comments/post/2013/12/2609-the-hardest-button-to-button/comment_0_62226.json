I'm not sure if my camera has as many configuration settings as the EM1 (very doubtful) since I haven't looked into the menu other than to reformat my card when I'm out of space which hasn't happened since I upgraded to a new, larger card. My daughter's PEN is certainly pretty good menu wise with lots of ways for her to configure the camera in a way that works well for her. Maybe it's time I took a closer look at my own camera."
