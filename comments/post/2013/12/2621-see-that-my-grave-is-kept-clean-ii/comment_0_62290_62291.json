They don't produce completely the same results as Olympus' in-camera processing, but I think at least \"Natural\" is fairly close. That's what I use when shooting color, that's what I can compare. On the other hand, I don't shoot RAW to just emulate the camera's JPEGs. Therefore I don't care a lot about profiles and their accuracy.\n\nThe other major change, and for me that's the big one, is that fact that the in-camera aspect ratio is no longer baked. You can change the crop after the fact, but of course the default is exactly what you saw in the viewfinder and what you've composed for.\n\nThus I'd say, go for it. It's definitely an upgrade."
