I like this picture a lot, the composition and colours all work beautifully.\n\nI'm thinking of upgrading to Lightroom 5 and I'd be interested to know your opinions on the Olympus camera profiles (I have an E-M5). Are they reasonably accurate? At the moment I use Lightroom 4.4 which doesn't have any Oly profiles and sometimes the Adobe conversion is a bit too saturated for my taste. \n\nRichard"
