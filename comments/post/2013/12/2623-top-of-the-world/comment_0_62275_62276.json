I am absolutely lousy when it comes to Hip Hop and most forms of Rap ðŸ˜„\n\nFact is, I don't hear radio, I hardly go to concerts, I tend to explore epochs though. Over a period of about eight years I've made it through around 1000 CDs, from Vivaldi back to the Troubadours, and then up to SchÃ¶nberg and Webern, skipping Haydn, Schubert, Brahms and Mahler, but spending almost a year with Wagner. Some other years I hear mostly Jazz, but in general I consider my taste broad. Some friends on the other hand call it no taste at all ðŸ˜„"
