    "content": "I have made an - expensive - mistake. First I have bought the E-M1, not even thinking about the new zoom lens. Two months later I could try one directly from Olympus. And I have bought it a week later. And I am very satisfied , even when I own more ore less the same primes like you. Instead of the 17mm 1.8 - which I have sold a year ago already - I have kept the Panalux 25mm, which I like very much.\n\nAnother thing, what I didn't expect, that I will ever buy an extra battery pack for a camera. But I did now. The E-M1 + battery pack + 12-40 mm in a small bag is not to heavy but the handling is better (for me of course). And another small bag contains the primes and the camera without battery pack for another day."
