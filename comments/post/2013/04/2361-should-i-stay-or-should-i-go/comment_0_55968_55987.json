    "content": "Sam, the reason why I began using Photoshop was, that it was the only program on the market with 16-bit colors, and almost every tutorial on the Internet is about Photoshop. I then switched to Lightroom, because my version of Photoshop does not support the OM-D, while otherwise it completely suffices for the few cases when I want to do things that are not possible in Lightroom. I like the user interfaces and with current prices for Lightroom I can't imagine switching to another software solution. Additionally by switching to Lightroom I got rid of my separate image database IMatch. While IMatch is a good DAM tool, its interface is dated. Lightroom works just as well for me and it's even faster and much easier to use.\n\nAt work I really like using Free Software. For years I've compiled my own GNU C compiler, gdb, emacs, TeX, X11, etc, and while these times are long gone, I still prefer open solutions like Eclipse. Often they are the best tools for the job, and where they don't lead significantly, they are still among the best.\n\nIn image processing, things are pretty different. I like The GIMP for what it is, but it is not anywhere near the leading commercial solutions, and even if it were, I wouldn't switch, because I wouldn't want to learn the new UI."
