I mention this mostly because it fascinates me to see what type of image catches my eye. This image is the kind that stops me and makes me look and yet I imagine most people would not give it a second glance (and I don't mean to be rude here, I hope you understand what I mean). It is the kind of image I would not hesitate to put on a wall in my house. More so than some pretty landscape or other such work."
