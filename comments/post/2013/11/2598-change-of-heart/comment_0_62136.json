I've postet a short review with my findings here: http://lensblues.com/articles/gear-reviews/olympus-m-zuiko-ed-12-40mm-f2-8-review/.\nIt would be great if you could also give a short resume of your experience with the lens in some days on your blog. I'm really courious about the opinion of someone who's using mainly primary lenses ðŸ˜‰\n\nBest regards and have a nice day,\nAndrew\n\nBtw: the 'Night Vision'-shot from monday is very nice - great colors - luck was with you ðŸ˜‰"
