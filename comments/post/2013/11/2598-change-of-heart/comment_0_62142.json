    "content": "I look at your posts daily, Andreas, especially since you started using the EM-5 and associated Olympus lenses.  Mostly because I have the same camera and lenses and I love to compare your results with what I'm seeing (and with my Canon 5D MK II).  So I look carefully at your images in the X2 display mode you offer (a little bit of pixel peeping, I guess).  In any case, I come away with the same conclusion that I'd drawn with my own results - which is that, generally speaking, the EM-5 is just as good as the Canon.  And a whole lot easier to handle.  \n\nI've also been watching the EM-1 reviews for quite a while.  But I must say that when I looked closely at your image today I was very impressed.  Of course I don't know if it's the camera that's making the difference, the lens, or a combination of the two.  But it's very, very good.\n\nBottom line, I'm thinking about it.  Time to finally sell the Canon stuff, I think, before everyone else gets the same idea (to switch, that is)."
