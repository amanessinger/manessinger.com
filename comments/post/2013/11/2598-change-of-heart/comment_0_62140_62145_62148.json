These days I only ever go out with whatever lens I have on my camera but someday when I have more time to dedicate to making photos that may change and any benefits gained by small APS-C bodies (or even 35mm bodies with the A7R &amp; A7) are instantly negated as soon as you need multiple lenses. But the body still needs to feel right and try as I might the EM5 just doesn't. Maybe the EM1 will."
