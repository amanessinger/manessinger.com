She has been in court several times for demonstrating against industries' practises, latest one was against Arctic drilling for which she was jailed in Russia.\n\nI'm sure many people would label Saarela a terrorist, but from the viewpoint of societal \"industrial decay\" I feel that there is something of value in what she has been doing, even though she has been on the wrong side of the law. The younger generation (or at least some of them) may understand more of the world than we do.\n\nA couple of days ago I walked with my daughter by the meat product shelf in a shop, and she said \"A lot of animals were killed here\". I'm not really a vegetarian but lately I have been selecting the vegetarian choice more and more often."
