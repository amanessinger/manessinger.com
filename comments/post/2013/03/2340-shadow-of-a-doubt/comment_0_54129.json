    "content": "Once upon a time I was almost 100% Google. Then they started removing some of their services. At first it didn't matter so much but it started to hurt when they closed Google Notebook, iGoogle and various other services I'd invested time in.Google Reader is the last of the Google products I use and it is the one I use the most. It is my primary portal to the Internet. The problem with Google is two-fold as I see it. First their customers are corporate companies not the people who use their products. Second, they do not provide a subscription option for most of their products. As such since we do not pay them and we are not even customers we have no retort when they close down a service.\nI would guess that the primary factor which played a role in gReader's demise is the fact that it didn't make any money for Google. There was no easy way for them to plug adverts in the feeds.\n\nHaving said all this, the end of gReader is probably not a bad thing. I suspect there will be new players now that it will not be around. Anyway, I too am looking for an alternative and have been for some time as it's been clear for a while that gReader was on the way out. There isn't much out there that offers the ease of use that gReader offers. Feedly is fairly good, a little buggy but no use to me as it is only iOS and Android. There's bloglovin which I have yet to try, newsblur, netvibes and a couple of others but none provide an app for WP so I might be left out completely come July."
