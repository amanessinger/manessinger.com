Shooting snow (or white sands on our beaches) is always a little tricky. With snow I used to add 2 stops of exposure when metering off the brightest part of the scene. Once upon a time I carried a grey-card and metered off that. Though in your case it sounds like it was mostly the white balance that was off but that seems odd to me. I haven't shot snow in a long time but I don't recall having it look blue on a sunny day. If I failed to adjust the exposure it used to look grey. Perhaps my memory is failing me.\n\nOne thing for sure: our eyes and our brains are truly amazing at automatically taking care of such bothersome things ðŸ˜‰"
