As an aside, it turns out that the 'Pale Male' , in the song is, or rather was, an actual red-tail hawk which lived near Central Park, NYC.  I say was, because it made the news last summer when it was found dead.\n\nNice pic. Another example of your ability to  find images where most, myself specifically, would just pass them by."
