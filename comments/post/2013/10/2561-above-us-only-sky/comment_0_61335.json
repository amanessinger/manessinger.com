    "content": "We are HADD hyperactive agency detection devices. We detect agency is things that have no agency.  Its better to have false positives than false negatives.  Religion is based on ascribing agency to the world around us even though no agency exists.  People find religion comforting because its comforting to be in groups of like minded herd members, and for the \"just so\" stories.\n\nIf we can't get off the planet, we had damn well better take care of it.  It's what makes the specter of global warming so terrifying."
