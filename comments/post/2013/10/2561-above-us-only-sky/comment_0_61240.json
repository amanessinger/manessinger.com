Another way of putting it is that physics doesn't care about our feelings. Which is why, I believe, people turn to religion. Religion is physics with personality. Which makes people feel like life isn't totally pointless. Of course, odds are that it is in fact, totally pointless. In the great scheme of things at least.\n\nWhat's interesting about this, is that rather than depressing me, these ideas make my life exceptionally easy to bear. Why that is, I cannot say for sure.\n\nBTW, that is a cool photo Andreas."
