Normally that would be sports with long lenses under extreme weather conditions ðŸ™‚\n\nOther than that you can just use whatever you want to carry or what satisfies your desires for shallow DOF. For me I found out that shallow DOF can be achieved with Micro Four Thirds if you want it, though you sometimes have to get closer. It's not my prime concern these day though. Overall a very portable kit is my personal sweet spot. Ymmv."
