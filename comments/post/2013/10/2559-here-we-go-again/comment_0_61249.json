    "content": "My first love was a little Fuji bridge camera -- which I still have, in a shoebox. ðŸ™‚\n\nEventually, it couldn't satisfy my needs so I acquired my new best friend forever: the D300. At some point, that's going to bite the dust and I'll have to enter into a new relationship. Ack!\n\nAll a roundabout way of saying: When I moved to the D300, I knew what I wanted that I couldn't accomplish with the Fuji. Now, I'm not sure what my criteria are for changing to another system. Your posts keep me thinking about that, instead of being seduced."
