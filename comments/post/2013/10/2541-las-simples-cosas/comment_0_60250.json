    "content": "I miss European forests. Our forests here tend to have thick underbrush making them impenetrable, forcing people to stick to the path (when there is one).\nI would say you succeeded in getting a natural feel and look for this scene. I usually find it difficult to render forest scenes to look as I see them. As you say, cameras tend to be fooled and the standard dynamic range of sensors simply can't cope with the contrast that is usually created by the dappled sunlight. Resorting to post-editing is the only way to try and save such images."
