Since more than 45 years I am reading everything what is available (for me) about all kinds of photography and photographic topics. I am searching every day in the internet for interesting news, interesting photographers and their work. In my life I have taken many 10.000 of pictures myself, I am (better: was) also collecting photographs from famous (beginning with A, like Ansel Adams) and also not so famous photographers, if I liked the pictures. Nowadays I am  reducing the time, reading, looking, etc., and  I am trying to concentrate on few intersting sites like yours, books, pictures. I have found your blog by chance via a link on a blog from Far East some months ago and now I am a little bit caught by your pictures, which have for me a very special character, which cannot be seen at a first glance.Theyt seem to be \"only\" everyday pictures . But I have the feeling, there is a second layer behind the \"curtain\", which brings my interst up. I like you pictures, also your thoughtful comments about this and that, and last but not least I am also surprised about you stunning choice of music, you are linking with the titles of your photos."
