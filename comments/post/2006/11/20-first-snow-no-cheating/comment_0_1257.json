    "content": "The artist, as opposed to the audience,experiences a special rush, unique only to him. That's what the process is all about. Performing artists can be observed doing it, but even there, the audience cannot know what is happening as the artist goes from nothing to something. Photoshop is a tool analagous to a clarinet, a tu-tu, a paint brush, a fountain pen, or a hunk of clay. Tools and materials allow the artists to enter the process... it's very good of them to do that. It's the process, even more than the product, which keeps so many of us coming back.<br/><br/>Odd though, when's the last time you heard anyone saying, nice job Ad... you give good process?<br/><br/>Great work... love the cable...<br/><br/>Ted"
