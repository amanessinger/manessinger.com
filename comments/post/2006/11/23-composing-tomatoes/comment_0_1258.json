    "content": "You are so obsessed with the \"organic\" nature of the perfect composition-through-the-lens!l Weeeerd. Your art form transends that. You have the power to find more in an image during the post-processing. You don't \"alter\" things there... you both find and improve them. Stop apolgizing for making art. Start enjoying what you are doing in toto. You are doing art-photography, not some sort of Nikon ad. What the camera produces is a step. One that you controlled, what the image concludes is the result of a wonderfull process... frequently many steps beyond what that Nikon can do!<br/><br/>Ted"
