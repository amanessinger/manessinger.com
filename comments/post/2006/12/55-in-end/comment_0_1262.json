    "content": "Whoa! It's the comic-book-art angle which injects so much power into this abstract. I love it that it's a monochrome filling the space with NOIR! Noir is king in so many prescient images. And the grainy fog pierced with beams and glows allow the twin triangles to compress the information against the huge negative space in the southwest. I can hear minor chords played loud here. This must be astonishing in a large print. Great work skipping rignt along the line between \"Wow!\" and \"Hmmm...\" <br /><br /><br />Thanks for sharing it.<br /><br /><br />Ted"
