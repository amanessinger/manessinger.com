Vienna, one of the legendary cities of Western civilization... a city littered with the debris of the world's greatest artists... a place of museum-preserved facades... <br /><br />And yet, it does grow increasingly difficult to see the unusual in a place which to you is 'usual'. Try this... go onto any street and snap randomly in as youslowly twirl completely around. Then do it again, zoomed in. Try the same process, assuming the street is well lit... at night. <br /><br />I guarantee you that you will have more enticing images than most will ever experience. Especially with your post processing imagination."
