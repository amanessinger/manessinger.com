  "content": "Sigh. I  was once interested ... no fascinated ... no addicted ... to government. Over the years. I developed many close acquaintances  among politicians and officials. Now, not so much. It’s fascinated me to unlock the motivation of politicians. Who, I wonder, seeks  a political vocation? Especially since none of those people in the business could really explain how it works. As a child I had a Plastic Man toy. He could be stretched into myriad shapes, then slowly reform. That’s all he did;  bend, stretch, scrunch, then reform. Otherwise he was useless. His utility was solely in reforming after abuse. \n\nI wonder why your fascinating essay brings that toy to mind? Hmmmmmm..... hope you are well particularly after your daring (and beautiful) trip through northern Italy. Please take care. ",
