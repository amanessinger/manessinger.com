  "content": "You know those images which have two distinct meanings but need to be studied before a second appears. Like the twin faces which suddenly pop into an urn, an urn which you cannot ever again not see? Well that happened to me with this image. Until I read your explanation, what I saw was a recently uncovered Roman floor mosaic. The POP! now I cannot unsee the construction hardware. The thing about these deal images things is that both - unrelated - world's exist simultaneously. Which led me to wondering how the interpretation of art by a myriad of visitors is just like those dual meaning urn-images. Regardless of an artist's intent... it is the interpretation of the viewer that matters - to that viewer. What is it that artists like you (and me) are creating? Story arcs beyond... beyond our own imaginations? Hmmm.... thanks for this image and now I gotta go off and think on what artistic meaning is... if it that term isn't a puzzling oxymoron at base? Oh, btw, I totally like this entire series of found texture. ",
