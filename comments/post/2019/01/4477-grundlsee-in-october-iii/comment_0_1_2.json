  "content": "Funny, yes, it's pretty much the opposite :)\n\nI wouldn't have bought an iPhone. There never was a lack of potent Android phones, and since the introduction of Android One, we are almost back to what we had with Nexus phones: excellent update policy and affordable prices. \n\nTablets were a problem though, after Google decided to give up on their Nexus line. I had the Nexus 7, then the Nexus 9, but after that, nobody had acceptable hardware but Samsung. Samsung was out of the question, because they used to swap \"Back\" and \"Active Apps\" navigation buttons. I would have been forced to use a Samsung phone. It's only recently that Samsung allows to configure the nav button order.\n\nAnyway, that's the reason why I ended up with an iPad Pro. Gorgeous hardware and a software that I still don't like and that I can't configure to look and feel like my phone.",
