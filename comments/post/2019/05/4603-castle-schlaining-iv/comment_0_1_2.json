  "content": "I think what we see here is the erosion of democracy by capitalism and technology. You are the center of capitalism, the center of the Empire, the biggest prize on the planet, therefore it is only fitting that the erosion has progressed more than elsewhere :)\n\nWell, of course that's a stupid simplification, but when we look at how campaigns are made these days, then it is clear you need tremendous amounts of money. It is also clear that we are witnessing widest-spread corruption and completely uninhibited lying in real-time. \n\nIn a way that is understandable. Throw out a lie, wait for the opponent to try to disprove it, and while he is still at it, attack him for it with another lie. Or use an unrelated lie. It really does not matter, it works always. It's only immoral, destroys truth and reality, but nobody cares about them anyway.\n\nThroughout the electorate this behaviour causes irritation, but at the same time a big part of it enjoys the spectacle. The less respectful the better. And then they vote for Trump. Or Strache. Believing that they throw a wrench into the despised machine. Which they are not.\n\nPeople are not so stupid to not recognise when they are being lied to, but when everybody does it, they take the liar with the biggest entertainment value. Maybe people in the US are just more desperate than in Austria, because in the US it has been going like that for a much longer time.",
