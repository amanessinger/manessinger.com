I don't share a love of them either, despite playing extensively with the process (inspired by your earlier work, I have to say).\n\nI also shoot Micro Four Thirds and these days I go for more blocked up images, such as you would get from a transparency film. Blacks and shadows are good! I'm also mindful of the limits of my equipment (Mk 1 EM-5D)\n\nThis is inspired partly because I grew up shooting slide film and also because of photographers such as Saul Leiter, Fred Herzog, Pete Turner. Masters of contrast!"
