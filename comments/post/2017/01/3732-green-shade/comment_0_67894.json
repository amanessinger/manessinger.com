That's why although I still shoot with an E-M1, I also kept an E-P2 with detachable EVF, a Sony A6000 and even a Lumix LX3. I've sold off three Nikons but can't seem to get rid of these others. I like using the smaller cameras when in public and the relatively large E-M1 for the more solitary landscape work. Decisions, decisions!"
