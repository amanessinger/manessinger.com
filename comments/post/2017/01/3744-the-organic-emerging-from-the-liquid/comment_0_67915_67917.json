In reality I've been using it for a few months now. \n\nIt has a noticeably smaller viewfinder and I don't ever use that pretty wheel at the front. That's OK though. I think I can clearly say that it is my most favorite camera so far. It's small, it's beautiful (as an object), it makes fine images and I love that exposure correction wheel. That gives me the back wheel for ISO control, which makes for a completely different shooting style. If I have a complaint at all, then it is, that Olympus has designed this for the PEN-F only. Switching between PEN-F and E-M1 is not as easy as it used to be between different Olympus models.\n\nOther than that, or if you just look for a single camera, the PEN-F is simply gorgeous."
