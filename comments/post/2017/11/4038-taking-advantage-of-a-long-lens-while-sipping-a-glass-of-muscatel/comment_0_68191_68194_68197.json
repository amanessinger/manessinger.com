    "content": "I see. That sounds like a powerful combo. I still only have the E-M10 (1st gen), and I mostly use the 14, 25, and 45mm primes with it - so nice and small. But I also love my older ZD 50/2 Macro (with MMF-2 adapter), which I guess is about the weight of a 12-40mm/2.8 zoom or thereabouts. As \"long\" lenses, we only have the 40-150mm/4-5.6, also with adapter so they're a bit slow on the non-phase-detect cameras."
