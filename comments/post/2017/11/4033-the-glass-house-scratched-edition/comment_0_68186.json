I thought that your bicycle images were wonderful.  That said...I can understand why it might have been boring for you and why you need to do other things.  Bottom line...you are the most important person in your life and you need to do what is best for you.\nThanks for all of your effort...and a special thanks for your bicycle images.\n-Jim Coffee-\nSan Diego, CA"
