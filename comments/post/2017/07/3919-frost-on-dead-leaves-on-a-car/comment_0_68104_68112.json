I really don't know whether it should console or further disturb me, that it always has. \n\nI have no idea if you know Viktor Klemperer's \"<a href='https://www.amazon.de/Language-Third-Reich-Bloomsbury-Revelations/dp/B01NGZZ6UG' target='_blank' rel=\"nofollow\">Language of the Third Reich: LTI: Lingua Tertii Imperii</a>\". I also can't guarantee for the quality of the translation, but that's what is available. Maybe you can get it at a library, maybe you can even read it in German. It's not all that hard language, but some of the subtle points may be hard to get.\n\nAnyway. Klemperer demonstrates how language has been weaponized by the Nazis. Of course you can pick out any epoch and find similar things, only probably not so well documented by contrasting evidence. I mean, much of what we know from Roman authors has to be taken at face value, because no contrasting account has survived.\n\nTo say it in one popular word: Sad ðŸ˜›"
