    "content": "There is a German three book edition of his diaries that I've read. It contains most of the material from LTI plus lots of autobiographic context. I suspect that your translation is based on an older edition, probably from GDR times. Klemperer stayed in Germany and ended up in GDR. He was some functionary there in the 1950s and I think he later got pretty disillusioned with the party, probably 1956 due to the Hungary crisis, but I can't remember.\n\nAs to the comments: I think you should be subscribed and everything should be set up fine. Obviously it ain't. Weird.\n\nDo you get asked for an email address when posting? Maybe you need to check a box? Hard to tell, because I'm obviously logged in as owner all the time. Must make an experiment with Safari ðŸ™‚"
