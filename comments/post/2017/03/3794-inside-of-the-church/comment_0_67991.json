I recently came upon a trove of 1970 Popular Photography mags. Frankly the small craft was primitive. Everything was softer than a pillow. Contrast bled terribly. Neither the optics, nor the focal plane shutters were up to the demands of the images... Don't even start to talk about the processing. \n\nIf what you mean is that among today's tech... then ok... it is the indian. And generally speaking an artist can do his stuff with almost anything off the shelf. But don't give me a Nikon or even a Leica from the 60s, 70s, or 80s. Or even a Hasselblad from the 70s. We got some pretty awesome tools today and this image up above proves it. Look how astonishingly clean it is, yet sharp and perfectly toned. \n\nSure, you are a master. But I do not think that the ancient tools of the last mid century would allow you to do anything like that... Especially as you waited ten days for Agfa, Fuji, or Kodak to send back the little cardboard boxes. Right?"
