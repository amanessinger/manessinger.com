    "content": "Yes, waiting for images was awful. It even prevented me from taking up photography, because I couldn't afford to by development gear myself, and waiting for labs as well as having no control over the results sucked out any joy.\n\nAs to sharpness, etc, I am sure that with proper technique you could make fine images on film that wold hold up well even to today's standards, but most of the time you didn't. If I make an image today, I almost routinely have a look at it on pixel level, and if it lacks the proper acuteness, well, I just take it again. Same with composition. And even for \"decisive moment\" images digital's perfectly honed autofocus does wonders. And now that mirrorless has more or less caught up in terms of autofocus speed, lens variation is out of the equation as well.\n\nYou're right, I'm really talking about today's gear."
