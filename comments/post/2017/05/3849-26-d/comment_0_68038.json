That they were milking a dead bottle of Dektol. When in fact I'd become a digisnob. You are, of course, correct to pull b&amp;w from your holster - especially to tug contrast (and meaning) onto a flat scene. And your b&amp;w version sports at least a hundred times more shades of grey than a recent best seller. \n\nReally enjoy grabbing inspiration from your work Andreas, have for years. BTW, we'll be cruising down a river in your very neighborhood this summer. Drop me an email sometime. Happy summer..."
