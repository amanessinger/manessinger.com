There are some things you'll recognize, most likely the treatment of corners, but but everything else is moods and fads. And that's perfectly ok for me. Now, in times of shooting much less, I also tend to meditate longer about certain images. Just two days ago I finished one that took me weeks to get \"right\", if that's what it is now.
