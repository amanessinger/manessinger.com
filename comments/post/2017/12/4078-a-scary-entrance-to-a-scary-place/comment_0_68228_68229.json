    "content": "Well, I've seen Auschwitz I and Auschwitz Birkenau a few years ago. Auschwitz I, the former Austrian army barracks, then turned KZ, still looks much like it must have looked. Pretty nice brick buildings actually, some electric fences, but somehow you fail to recognize the monstrosity. It could be just a normal prison. \n\nAuschwitz Birkenau, that's the vast area with the infamous entrance, behind which lay a an enormous area of primitive wooden barracks, and that's the Auschwitz that we know, the \"Vernichtungslager\", the Auschwitz with gas chambers and ovens.\n\nSome very few barracks remained, but other than that it is a vast and mostly empty area. And in a way this is, what makes it so impressive. The empty space makes you realize how unimaginable the horror is.\n\nIn case of the risiera it is different but similar."
