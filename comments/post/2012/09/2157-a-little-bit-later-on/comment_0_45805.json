I have a friend in England who still is. He works for one of the big banks and is one of two guys who supports the old legacy Cobol systems. He gets paid quite nicely for it too ðŸ™‚\n\nBy the way, your photo is brilliant. It is the kind of scene that would have me clicking the shutter too. And you've processed it perfectly."
