    "content": "The Nexus 7 is completely smooth, and although I have tried only one game, ZenBound2, it feels exactly as it did when I tried it on the iPhone a year ago. Of course the iPhone had a much smaller screen and the game was originally developed for iOS. Scrolling, browsing, all fast, definitely the fastest and smoothest I have ever seen on Android.\n\nIt comes with batteries loaded, you turn it on, it asks for your preferred language, your choice of WiFi, asks you to login to GMail, and then it begins automatically to download all your apps. I have quite some for my Galaxy S2, thus that took a while and a few are seemingly not compatible with Jelly Beans. It also missed a few that are and that I could install manually without obvious problems. Don't know why. \n\nI kept the original launcher instead of ADW. ADW was installed, probably felt slower compared to stock JB, and it didn't carry over my settings anyway. Apart from that I wanted to try the stock JB launcher.\n\nI also had to login to Amazon to use my Kindle app, but it all works extremely well. No regret ðŸ™‚"
