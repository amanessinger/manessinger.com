    "content": "Yeah, it would be easy to feel offended. I knew it and I still left it in. The reason is, that although it can be a very comfortable niche, it can easily turn into a nightmare if you are ever forced to change jobs, to do freelance work, etc. \n\nCOBOL, CICS, host programming in general, are in steep decline for two reasons:\n\nPeople get older and no new come into the job. This is actually in favor of those who still do it. I remember a funny ad by MicroFocus, the major COBOL vendor still left. The ad showed a team of people who were all in their fifties. It was funny because it is completely against the trend in advertising, but the reason is clear: it reflects reality.\n\nThe other effect is, that companies don't want to rely on their soon-to-be retired developers, and instead of hiring and educating new COBOL programmers, they move projects off the host, to Windows or Java/Linux.\n\nCobol is not dead, but like film it smells funny."
