It's been a long time since I've left a comment, but I've followed your blog since around day 500.\n\nFor the last year and half I've had photos you took (days 1021 and 1588) as my phone's backgrounds: http://goo.gl/xWNKZ\n\nI feel like it's time to change it up, but I'd still love to use some of your photos. I started sifting through your archives, but thought I should maybe pose the question to you. Do you have any favorite images that you think would suit a phone background? I respect your taste and love your photos, so I thought it'd be cool to have your input and opinion.\n\nThanks, and keep the amazing photos coming!"
