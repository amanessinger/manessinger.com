Always post ðŸ™‚\n\nIt's so easy in Adobe's 2012 process: Set color temperature if necessary, use exposure for basic brightness, contrast for contrast, highlights to tame the highlights (here it may well be -100), maybe shadows to open up the shadows, white and black to set levels. Add some clarity and vibrance to taste. Done.\n\nIt's all done in Lightroom, I hardly use Photoshop any more."
