    "content": "Exactly. Of course due to the crop factor of 2 you get more DOF. I like it in everyday shooting, but for images like this, a DSLR, especially FX, would be better. \n\nThe alternative is always to go near, but the 17/2.8 has a near focus distance of 20 cm. You see that the focus is back in the distance. With the LX5 or for example the Sigma 20/1.8 on my DSLR, it is much easier to get that kind of abstractions and an attractive blur.\n\nI think the way to go will be the holy trinity of m4/3, the Olympus 12/2.0, the Panasonic 20/1.7 and the Olympus 45/1.8. At the moment I feel that I've spent enough though ðŸ™‚\n\nFortunately I can always use my Nikon 50/1.2 or one of the Nikon macro lenses. This should suffice for my shallow DOF needs for the moment."
