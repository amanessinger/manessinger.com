Lightweight and compact. I really should have the better and faster and more expensive Panasonic 20/1.7, but the Olympus was part of the kit. I bought the camera on eBay and the most important thing for me was the electronic viewfinder. 550â‚¬ for the former top of the line Olympus E-P2, the EVF and 17/2.8 and a spare battery, that was a no-brainer.\n\nI really like the camera. It's well made, solid, professional, looks very, very good, and the image quality is absolutely good enough. Better than the Panasonic LX5, not quite as good as the Nikon D300, but near enough and in a very comfortable size."
