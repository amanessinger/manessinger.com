You've been putting lots of pressure on yourself for how many years? Don't you think you deserve to give yourself a vacation once in a while?\n\nDiane Varner set up some images to be auto-posted while she took a few days off. So perhaps you can figure out how to do this, also?\n\nI do applaud you for your great effort over the past few years. Since I don't check in here every day, I don't \"need\" to see a different image every day! So just relax.  ðŸ™‚"
