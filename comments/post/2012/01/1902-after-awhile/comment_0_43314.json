    "content": "So it is. But it is interesting to think why this is so. \n\nGreed and power seem to be interlinked in a complex manner. All politicians seem to be corrupted by power the instant they get some (well, there may be one or two exceptions, although I doubt it). And almost everyone wants more, more, more of things to own, selling themselves another way to the same sources of corruption.\n\nI have been reading essays of Emma Goldman, and what she wrote a hundred years ago describes the world we live in: big industry does not care a bit what happens to peole, all that matters is the capability to produce more with less cost.\n\nAnd what she wrote, that all in the end depends on personal choices, that is disturbingly true: there is nobody to blame but each one of us."
