    "content": "By the way, after reading the Nix book I happened to read a book by Jasper Fforde, the first in a (planned) trilogy, \"Shades of Grey 1: The Road to High Saffron\". \n\nThis book also describes a future society, after some big \"change\", several hundred years into the future, a world which seems quite familiar (a satirical version of UK) but at the same time quite frightening (it turns out to be a totalitarian regime of the most awful kind). Fforde mixes science fiction with societal satire in a rather original way. \n\nI have never read anything by Fforde before, and this was a very positive surprise. He has written a lot of other stuff as well."
