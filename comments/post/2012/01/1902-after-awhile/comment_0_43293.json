    "content": "I read the book, and quite a fast read it was, Nix knows how to tell a story. Also the language is relatively easy to read, fitting the \"young adult\" category.\n\nThe basic premise is an interesting mixture of science fiction and fantasy, the story isn't terribly original but there are nice inventions and twists here and there. The four major human characters are not too deeply described, but the action is what matters in a story like this. Some of the plot twists were easy to anticipate, but the intended audience is probably not so jaded by plot intrigue as I am. \n\nAnd I liked the fact that given the rather horrible story setting the novel wasn't very violent. Another writer would probably indulged in much more graphical manner in the gory details, and that would have spoiled the atmosphere.\n\nI couldn't resist reading the last page of the book before reading the novel, a thing which may have spoiled the big surprise at the end. This is a personal failing, I seldom can resist peeking at what is in the end of a book. \n\nThanks for the recommendation, the book was well worth reading."
