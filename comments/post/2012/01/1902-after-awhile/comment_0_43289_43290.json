    "content": "Well, it's not exactly horror, at least as long as you don't try to visualize things ðŸ™‚\n\nLike all of Nix' books it is labeled \"young adult\". I probably wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than 12 years, but on the other hand, if I at 12 had been denied access to books like these on terms of not being mature enough, I would have seen this is a severe violation of my human rights ðŸ™‚\n\nNo, really, the book portrays a world where humans are seen as animals, right to be used as raw material for artificial creatures used in violent war sports of the \"Overlords\". Interestingly enough the question of where those children come from is never really touched. It is assumed that there is some kind of breeding, but really we are never told.\n\nI don't know if he went for that analogy, but in a way this is not so different from how we treat animals. For reasons of convenience we just assume that they have no personality and no consciousness, but of course we assume the opposite from our pets. It's really only to be able to treat them as material. Kinda scary, huh?\n\nThe level of violence in this book is average, probably on par with the LOTR. A certain familiarity with the concept of sex is assumed as well. Two characters at least speculate about having sex (although there is nothing graphic) and in general sex is not treated as a taboo but instead as something positive that happens. Very natural and healthy I'd say. There's a twist to this as well, but I don't want to give it all away.\n\nI suggest you read it for yourself. It's definitely enjoyable for adults, and then you'll see if you feel comfortable giving it to your children, or what sorts of concepts you want to talk through with them first."
