There is social change, there is knowledge spreading, there is political power, enormous agility, and the whole world is rapidly changing.\"\n\nYes, it's this freedom we all have now that's threatening to those who have tried to control us over the centuries. They're afraid now for their lives - for if word gets around via the internet about how these controllers have lied to us, while cheating and stealing our freedoms, then they're afraid they'll lose their power.\n\nIt was via the internet lots of times that people in one part of the world have discovered what was happening in other parts of the world that their own government didn't want them to know about - and therefore these events didn't appear in the controlled mainstream media of his country.\n\nIt's all about control by the few - and well they should be worried about losing their control."
