To his credit, he does he change his view when presented with accurate information. I guess his blog is an opportunity for two-way education. ðŸ˜‰\n\nAnd you made a great point about commercialising the 'net: perhaps we should have two versions. The \"Wild West\" we have now and a more formal + business orientated one."
