    "content": "An excellent write up, Andreas.  I used to read Kirk Tuck, but sometimes found him a bit too arrogant and insulting, so I stopped reading. It's nice that I have that right. I agree with you that the US, nor any other country, should control the internet. I like the free exchange of ideas. I think that you summed it up completely when you said:\n<blockquote>\nNobody asked you to try to make money on the Internet, nobody asked you to “go digital”. Don’t whine when it doesn’t turn out as in your arrogance you thought it would. Leave us alone. Go die somewhere where your foul pestilence does no harm.\n</blockquote>\nThat would be perfect. They could invent their own network, ProfitNet, and have control of everything, but I'm sure that they know that they couldn't compete and that few people would follow them. They are not selling anything at all that's needed. They sell entertainment, period."
