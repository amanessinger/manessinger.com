    "content": "Well said Andreas. I too read Kirk's blog, have done for a long time now and like you I like his take-no-crap attitude. And like you I was surprised by his views on this topic. However it seems he is now a convert as he just posted on Twitter \"I'm ready to run for president. I flip flopped on the whole SOPA thing. You all were right. The ends don't justify the means. Do over?\"\n\nThe thing is I understand Kirk's frustrations as an artist who is trying to make money from his art, the sad thing is that the people who push SOPA try to sell it in such a way that it convinces many who do not/cannot know how the Internet works that it's a good idea for <i>their</i> bottom line.\n\nThe Internet is still in its infancy as far as its potential goes. We can only imagine where it will go and even then we'd be underestimating it. But one thing is sure, if we break it now we might never recover."
