    "content": "Well said Andreas. I had the same feeling when I read Kirk's post yesterday. He had pointed out a quite narrowed view, his view, and when not considering the broader reality, one could sympathize with his point of view. But what I immediately felt he was missing are the other aspects of change - the demise of Kodak is one point where he expresses his mourning, but similar things go on in the printing and publishing industry, made partly obsolete by the digitalisation he so perfectly uses with his bundle of different cameras. (Camera industry - nah, not worth a second thought)."
