Or the Fibonacci series, which this isn't quite, either?\n\nI measured the larger version: from left edge to right side of phone pole = 6.5 cm. From there to the right edge = 13cm. Height is 7.5 cm. Roughly, but close enough. For the Fibonnaci series, you need an 8 to go with the 13, lol.\n\nOh well, I never was good at math. I like the image in this present long pano version. I like the bits of red and green with more bits of yellows - and perhaps a tad of blue in the right half.\n\nI tried cropping off from the left to get rid of the phone pole, but then the scene seemed cramped. Like perhaps those drivers feel as they wait in their cars for the light to permit them to be on their way again?"
