The noise isn't all that bad - sort of what I get with my Nikon D300 at 3200.\n\nMore and more, this Olympus OM-D seems to be the wave of the future. Wish I could afford it right now. Perhaps I could if I were willing to trade in everything else I have in the way of photo equipment, lol. Not ready to let go just yet, tho."
