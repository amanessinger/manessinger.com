    "content": "Actually all cameras of all brands are around there or will be in a generation. I think it's not worth switching based of current best ISO. ISO is a fleeting target. The reason why I made the move was definitely size and weight, and of the smaller cameras the OM-D currently has the feature set that best fits my needs. \n\nIt also seems to be the most perfect camera of them, meaning that it lacks all kinds of annoyances that others have. Fuji seems to be weak at autofocus and the lens range for the X-Pro-1 is small and expensive. Panasonic lacks sensor stabilization, Nikon 1 lacks usability and lenses, Samsung and Sony have too big sensors and thus too big and heavy lenses."
