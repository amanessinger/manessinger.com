But it sounds like this LR/Mogrify 2 can be used as a stand-alone, without having to load it into Lightroom?\n\nI have used the Image Magick interfaces countless times, so I am familiar with that software. I even have friends who use it in its command line form. Not me. I don't want to spend time hunting through lines of code to find the one I want to change, lol. I just like to click on buttons instead.\n\nThat term, mogrify, sounds like gnomes and trolls and fairies invented it, lol."
