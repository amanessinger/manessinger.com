    "content": "At the Ministry of Education and Culture I'm currently involved (thought this is not my main responsibility) in things related to cultural heritage in the so-called \"National Digital Library\" project, which is trying to preserve and make available (also for the next generations) material from Finnish libraries, museums and archives, for all kinds of uses. \n\nBut the complications seem enormous, and when the commercial side seems to be a) overly aggressive and b) shooting their own foot, I feel there is a real possibility of the situation developing into very bad directions. I hope I'm wrong."
