Lightroom did OK with the noise, too.\n\nAs for the song, I like both Sinead's and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yymONwzP7o&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bulu Benton's</a> versions. I like to just consider the human voice as another instrument and listen to it that way, instead of trying to make out each word. The rhythm is bouncy and makes me feel like getting up and dancing."
