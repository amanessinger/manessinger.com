I had to laugh when I saw the silhouette image.\n\nYour image of 2 pedestrians in the bicycle lane and no vehicles in the vehicle lanes - altho it's an austere, totally man-made area/scene, is quite intriguing. I'm assuming you were the 2nd, but unseen, pedestrian.\n\nThe image of the bicycle makes me wonder what on earth its owner has to lug around - and whether he has a hard time balancing to get started. (Remembering my kiddie days having a hard time trying to get started while balancing a heavier than normal load.)"
