    "content": "Those are the bikes of people (from the looks I assume many of them are Pakistani, don't know why, they satisfy my prejudice of Pakistani looks, but certainly most or all of them are foreigners) who work for a private mail service. They distribute newspapers and advertising material all over Vienna. In fact that's what happens when a working, state monopoly like the Postal Service gets destroyed in the name of privatization.\n\nJobs are lost, the work gets done by people who (have to) do it for much less money and no security, some people make big profits. \n\nIt does not work in any way better now. Instead of one type of infrastructure, the post office, we've got a multitude of contracts between different companies and local shops. Gone are the times when an unsuccessful delivery meant you got a yellow slip of paper with which you could get your package at the next post office. Today it can well happen that after the unsuccessful delivery your package is brought to a central hub tens of kilometers away. It happened to me twice, once with an expensive tripod that almost was sent back to Germany. I could fetch it from the hub on the last day before it was sent back, and I only ever knew, because I finally managed to contact someone at the shop. Oh my! Don't get me started ðŸ˜„"
