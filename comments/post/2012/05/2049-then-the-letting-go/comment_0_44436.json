    "content": "I agree with Joe. The cross image has a primary subject plus the wall ornamentation would be the secondary subject. They go nicely together.\n\nWhereas, in the first image, even tho there is a repeat echo of forms between the bird bath and the column behind it, for me, the column overwhelms the bird bath. And I have no idea what that black thing on the column is.\n\nHowever, the upper 2/3rds of the image has a nice circular eye movement in it. Perhaps a crop up from the bottom would help. Below the bowl of the bird bath are elements that don't seem to belong with the rest of the image.\n\nBut this is just MHO."
