It takes a special person behind the lens to make that one! I love love love that shallow depth of field and the wonderful bokeh. Here color IS form, since there's nothing else in sharp focus other than that string thing.\n\nIs that an Olympus lens, or another manufacturer's? Andreas, you're really tempting me to do something rash - like go out and get one of these cameras and some lenses - and ditch a lot of my Nikon and Fuji bodies that take Nikon lenses! AARRGGHH!!!"
