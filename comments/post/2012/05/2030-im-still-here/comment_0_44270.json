At first I thought the fence image was of tire treads - then I clicked to see the larger version. then went back to look at the thumbnail again and now I don't see why my brain tricked me into see tire treads, lol.\n\nDo you suppose that bike - first image - has had its wheels stolen? The tram image almost makes me motion sick - yet I don't get motion sickness!"
