Some have taken hiatuses of almost a year - so I find myself wondering why they bother to even keep paying for a blog. Thank you for this, and also thank you for all the interesting topics you discuss outside of the actual images that you post. ðŸ™‚\n\nSpeaking of images, I do like looking at the various lines in this image that seem to converge in lower right, even though they are on different planes."
