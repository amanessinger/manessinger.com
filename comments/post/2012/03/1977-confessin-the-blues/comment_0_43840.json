    "content": "So often so-called experts insist that we're not really artists unless --- whatever their own focus happens to be - they seem to want everyone else to conform.\n\nThat's not my way. I shoot anything that I find captures my interest. I have no consistent style - a lot of my images that I like, others consider to be \"merely\" postcard quality. Well, hey, that's OK - I happen to like postcards, too - and some photographers make a living shooting postcard scenes.\n\nI guess that passion means different things to different people. And as far as \"having to develop a consistent style\" - well, that leaves me out in the cold! So far I've found that I seem to have no style - and so in the eyes of some, this makes me \"less than\" instead of equal to or greater than - Who? Whom?"
