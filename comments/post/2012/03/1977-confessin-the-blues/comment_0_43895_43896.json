It's not that I see a triangle and two circles and say, hey, I'm going to photograph those shapes and, btw, what is it, oh, it's a bicycle!\n\nIt can be that way but mostly it works the other way round. When I'm out on the street, I look for bicycles, not triangles. I look for them because I know that they often make for interesting subjects because of their geometry. While actually taking the image, geometry always plays a role though."
