But I won't start on the definition of 'good photography' here in this comment for your sake ðŸ˜‰\n\nAnyway I think the thing that this post illustrates perfectly is that people seem to get very hung up on subjects as a very literal category of object - but you've shown very well how you can interpret it in a more abstract way. It's the visual element that you like, rather than the 'real world' classification of your subject  - and isn't photography a visual thing after all?"
