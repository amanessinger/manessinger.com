    "content": "I very much like your comment about your bicycle pictures. But abstract is maybe not the right word for it....because you can still see tha natural shapes, forms and lines.   As Cartier-Bresson said, I think, it's all about the geometry.  Sadly many people looking at such pictures - be they of bikes or buiidlings or whatever - don't see beyond the actual subject matter.  Even my otherwise photographically-inclined wife says to me sometimes \"Why are you taking a picture of that?\", as I take a shot of something whose shape/colour/relationship etc has grabbed my attention."
