    "content": "For me this conceptional thing is just an overvaluation of rationality. Iâ€™m not wondering about it because in a culture where initiative is more valued than impressibility and action more than experience, where \"doing it\" seems of value by its own, conception is mainstream even in art. But I really do not believe that thinking your pictures is better than finding them or even better: let them find you. To demand or impose conceptional photography is just an other limitation to ones freedom of expression, ones ability to surprise oneself.\n\nLong live wonder, long live astonishment!"
