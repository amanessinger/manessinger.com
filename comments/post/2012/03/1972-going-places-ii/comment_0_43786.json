Amazing!\" - A great description for a non-place if any. (And I didn't know that Daniken is still around - is he?)\n\nI seem to be rambling, it is one of those days. As to taking photographs, when it becames reflex, it just happens. A reflex which is a bit like clicking on a \"You have won 500 euros\" message in your inbox... ;-)\n\nBy the way, I suspect that some resources are being put to exploring the best wordings to get people to click on spam e-mail. I found an interesting <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/word-usage-spam\" rel=\"nofollow\">posting</a> about this, containing the nice phrase \"encouraging an immediate reaction, trying to get some sense of urgency\" as the overall target of spam. In itself this could be a motto for certain type of photography.\n\nAnyway, what I was aiming towards is the potential connection of the term \"non-place\" between the physical and virtual spaces. Spam is an example of something making a non-place out of the virtual.\n\nAnd finally, it is interesting that photographs of \"non-place\", at least these ones here taken by Andreas, are certainly not building a non-place here in the virtual - it is quite the opposite. I wonder why it is so..."
