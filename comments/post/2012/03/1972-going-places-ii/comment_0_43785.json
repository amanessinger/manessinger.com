A poster announcing a lecture by Von Daniken?! Amazing!\n\nAnother thing that struck me is the almost total lack of humans and any indication of human activity - just the impersonal signs and apparently empty streets and buildings. The 2nd thumbnail down on the right side does seem to show the wheel of a vehicle.\n\nAndreas, you are one of the few photographers I know who can make a non-place interesting!\n\nMike C, I hear you about having to live in a non-place. I get so tired of looking up and down my street in a typical American suburb! I have to get away from my own neighborhood to feel any motivations for making images! Andreas, at least in parts of Villach, you can find interesting doors and windows. Around here, I'd have to go into places in the larger city where it's not safe for a woman to go alone, even in the daytime, to find interesting architecture."
