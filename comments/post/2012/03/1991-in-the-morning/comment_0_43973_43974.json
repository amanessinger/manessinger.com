When I've finished a complicated refactoring, when I've worked on my program and it ends up not only faster, more powerful, but also much cleaner and simpler, it gives me a similar feeling of satisfaction as when I've finished a picture. So, yes, that what makes the fun part of my work is essentially the same as what makes the fun part in working with Photoshop. Both are like composing, like playing an instrument, like writing a story. The most striking difference is, that Photoshop is always fun for me ðŸ™‚"
