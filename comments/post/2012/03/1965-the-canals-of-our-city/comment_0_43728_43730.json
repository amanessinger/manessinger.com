I'd have been somewhere in mid-Germany, with more or less the same language, culture and even landscape. Four hours towards east is probably more interesting, because then you are in the great plains of Hungary.\n\nWhat really makes a difference, that is the sea, and of course that is Italy and its ancient and continuous culture."
