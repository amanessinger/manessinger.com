And as I never went that photoshop way in the past, I am more than content. It supports my way of showing how I saw the world and is in a similar way \"good enough\" as my m43 kit is. I am only envying the Olympus' stabilisation, but in January, when I bought my G3, I could imagine that something worth waiting would happen."
