Stairs and stairwells are not so easy to photograph well as the light is often tricky, the contrast high and the framing sometimes made difficult by curves that don't sit well in a square or rectangular frame.\nI like your second image the best. It induces a slight sense of vertigo despite the fact that it is looking up."
