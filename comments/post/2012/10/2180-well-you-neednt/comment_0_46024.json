    "content": "Good one. My brother is thinking about a cheap DSLR, but I'll point him to this one. IMHO, a Pen is better (tho not necessarily cheaper if you also consider the EVF). With the 14, 20, and 45mm we have all the lenses I'd ever need for about 99% of what I do. Sometimes even a kit zoom is good enough."
