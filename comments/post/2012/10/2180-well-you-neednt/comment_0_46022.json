    "content": "I totally agree with you. I sold my Canon 5D MkII and a raft of L lenses this last summer and replaced it with an OM-D and some nice lenses. I haven't looked back once, no angst, no regrets and nothing missed. In fact, not only is it physically liberating, it has helped my productivity too. It's a funny thing really, I started out with an Olympus 35RD then a Minolta X700, went through medium and large format phases and to full frame digital. I find what to do today with a little compact and my Olympus to be FAR more satisfying than what I ever did before."
