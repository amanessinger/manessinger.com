But to get the shot, you had to click when he was at that particular place, or you would have lost the opportunity.\n\nBlue skies. They have changed over the years, due to increased humidity/smog and also by the UN spraying chemtrails. So usually our skies are just a pale reflection of what we had even 30-40 years ago. Polarizers allow us to relive those wonderful deep blue skies of yore - that is, it we don't overuse them.\n\nI love the patterns of light and shadow in your third image.\n\nBut for the last one, even in the larger size, I wouldn't have been able to tell whether the man's shirt was plaid, checked or moir√©-ed."
