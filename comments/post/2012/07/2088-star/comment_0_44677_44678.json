The sun was almost but not completely centered, so I cropped very slightly, and of course I've added the border.\n\nWhat you see are internal reflections and refractions of a pretty cheap lens, closed down to f11. Actually I don't know what I focused on, but obviously the rays of the sun were so contrastful, that the AF chose that. I tried another shot wide open, but it makes less of an interesting star.\n\nBtw, I love to shoot into the sun, and this is an application where EVFs are much better suited. No way to get blind from looking into an EVF ðŸ™‚"
