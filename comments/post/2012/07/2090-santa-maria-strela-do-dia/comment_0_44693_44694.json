We just don't know if particular pieces were performed with voices alone or also with instruments, sometimes or always, or in a mixed case if instruments just doubled certain voices or replaced them. We have notations that record tonal value (but are not certain about how that maps to frequencies) and rhythm (which is normally relative, but to which base interval?), but there is no reliable  information about how the voices were performed, by vocal cord or by instruments. And if instruments, what instruments?\n\nIt is very similar to medieval churches. What we have is the basic architecture, and we principally know that most or very likely all were painted in wild colors. What colors, designs, etc? Sometimes something is left in a few places, often almost nothing. It's hard to imagine what Cluny has looked like (just as an example, Cluny may or may not be well known for whatever reasons).\n\nAs for me, a certain kind of speculation is charming, gives variation and may arguably be in line with a certain practice of performance that may have been in use in parallel to others, but way beyond that threshold it loses attraction to me. Sure, the Paniaguas have their reasons why they call that \"Music from ancient Greece\", but really, apart from the language it could be Klingon music as well ðŸ˜„"
