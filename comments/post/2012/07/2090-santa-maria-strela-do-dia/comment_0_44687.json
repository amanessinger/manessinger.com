It gives us the book from the bench level and just enough of the bench to tell us the context, from the book's viewpoint.\n\nThen in the background, we're confronted with a scene from modern times, featuring a motorcycles, buildings and billboards/signs. Definitely the book is out of its element. If it really is from the era of \"Santa Maria, Strela do Dia\", perhaps the book feels abandoned during the centuries contained and referenced within its covers. Now it's being exposed to our modern era, although not in a kind way. \n\nBut perhaps this book is just a modern telephone book and who will be interested in it in even a few years, except a historian trying to figure out who lived where during that year of the book's publication?\n\nEither way, I do not envy the book its present position."
