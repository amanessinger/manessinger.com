    "content": "Perhaps I'm the \"odd man out\" in this discussion. Why such an emphasis on being \"authentic\"? I'd rather take the suggestions offered by what little we know of early music notations and just \"run with it\".\n\n\"Variations of a Theme by (whomever had inspired that particular composer)\" - are frequently found among well-known composer's works. They didn't try for authenticity - they took the themes that had attracted them and had fun with them. This is what I'd like to see done, instead of all the \"head bashing against a brick wall\" kind of thinking. That's no fun. Music should be enjoyable.\n\nMany people deplore the fact that modern orchestras much larger than Bach, et al ever had access to, play Bach's et al's works. I like to think that we're imagining that Bach et al would have loved to have heard their compositions played by modern orchestras or groups on modern versions of the instruments they knew back in their days.\n\nMusic is fluid and has evolved over the ages. IMHO, it should keep on evolving, rather than going backwards.\n\nDo we want photography to go backwards? Some do, because they're exploring all the old time processes. But others want to go forward. I'm among the \"forward\" crowd in both music and photography!"
