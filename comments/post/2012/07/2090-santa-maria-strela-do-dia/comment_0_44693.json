    "content": "I find your observations regarding music interesting Andreas, especially your comment \"All performances are speculative\". I recently watched a documentary about Janine Jansen, a highly talented and gifted violinist (you have probably heard of her). At one stage she was trying to record a piece from Bach and she was deeply frustrated and unhappy with her efforts explaining how she was finding it difficult interpreting how to play it. At another point in the documentary someone talked about how a G note can be played hundreds of ways and that for someone like Jansen it was all about finding the one right way to play that G note in a particular piece. Quite inspiring and fascinating. Much like your photo really."
