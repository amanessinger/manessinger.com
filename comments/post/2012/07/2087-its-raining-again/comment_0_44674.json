    "content": "I like the play of the rows of colorful rectangles in the top part. I played with cropping off one and then two of those layers, but neither worked as well as having them the way you framed the image.\n\nThe vertical blinds that are not prominent in the rectangles of the windows then become echoed very strongly and prominently in the backs of the chairs, of which there are also 3. The 3 bushes echo another 3 theme.\n\nBut, sigh, then there's the table with 4 legs, lol. What's a guy to do, right?\n\nBut the 3 theme figures strongly in the whole composition - the layers of the windows, then the patio layer and finally the layer containing the plants.\n\nEven in the plants layer there are 3 predominant colors: the red flowers, the yellow-green vertical stems/leaves and the blue-green of the - looks like a low growing juniper?\n\nI could go on about the red flowers echoing the red of the wall under the windows, the yellows inside the room sort of echoing the yellows in the greenery - a very wonderful composition."
