    "content": "\"Upper Austrian\"? Never heard of it. Might it be akin to the \"hill billy\" country dialects or perhaps the Cajun in the south of the USA, if you happen to know about them?\n\nIt probably doesn't matter which dialect Hubert speaks, because his music speaks as does all music speak to the listeners' hearts. He sure is talented, to be able to play such diverse instruments. I like your series very much.\n\nNow, for the image of the day - well, frankly I like the small thumbnail under that much better. I have to laugh each time I see those two red \"eyes\" glancing to the left!\n\nAnd finally, another bicycle image. How you manage to give each of these bicycle images its own personality and sparkle and life is quite beyond me. How many hundreds have you shot of just bicycles? I never get tired of looking at them."
