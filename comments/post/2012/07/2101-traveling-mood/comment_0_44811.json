And then crop up from the bottom to meet the bottom of the building?\n\nThe most interest for me is in the texture of the stucco wall at the right with the grate over the window. This is contrasted with the building right next to it, with its colorful signs, yet shadowed doorway.\n\nThe way the image is right now, my eyes keep getting pulled away toward the left side by the bright red sign in the distance and the contrast between the white building there and the darker building to its right. My eyes do want to rest on and explore the textures in the right side of the image."
