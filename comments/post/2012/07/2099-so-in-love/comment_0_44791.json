I presume that the boy-bike on the left is really enjoying his encounter with the pink girl-bike! ROTFLOL\n\nBTW, my local camera dealer finally got in his Olympus order - minus 13 of them. He had ordered 14. He has no idea when or if he'll ever get the rest of his order. I have opted not to buy it, although I had first choice. It makes no sense for me to go with an entirely new system, when I have loads of Nikon-mount lenses.\n\nSo if I ever do switch to a lighter weight system, it'll still be within the Nikon group. So I'll get the 1X or whatever it's called. I can get an adaptor that will allow me to use my present Nikon-mount lenses on the smaller body. The conversion factor is something like 2.6 - so this will increase the apparent range of my lenses without having to spend mega bucks. Also I have a Fuji body that shoots IR and takes Nikon lenses. My dealer has loads of these small Nikons, too."
