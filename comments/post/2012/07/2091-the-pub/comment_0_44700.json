    "content": "I agree. Back in the early 1990s, there were quite a few unique and fascinating shops along Boulder, CO's, Pearl Street, which the town closed off the through traffic. I used to love to explore along Pearl Street - and buy! But by 1997, the city council had raised the rents, forcing some smaller shops to close. Those spaces were taken over by the big chains. So for me, Pearl Street lost its uniqueness. I have no idea what Pearl Street is like now, since I haven't been there since 1997.\n\nAround my area as well as in all other cities I've been in, each mall, of which there are too many for the population to \"support,\" they're all the same. Only the lay-outs and decors are different. Ho hum. And stores wonder why not many are buying anything.\n\nIf I want something unique, I go shopping on the internet. A company doesn't need a physical retail presence to sell products these days. Much less expensive to have only a warehouse with a receiving and shipping department.\n\nI love that sunset(?) image. It's just so gloriously golden!"
