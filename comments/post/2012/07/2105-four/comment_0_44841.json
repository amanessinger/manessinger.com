I was considering going with Nikon's 1V little camera with interchangeable lenses, because also - yes, for an expensive adapter - I could still use my Nikon-mount lenses. But you are so right when you say that it's counter productive to use the old DSLR lenses on these newer and smaller cameras. The major reason for moving to a smaller camera body, for me, is weight reduction. Using the older larger lenses defeats part of that purpose.\n\nAlso, Nikon's little one has an even smaller sensor than the micro 4/3rds cameras do. Even tho the image quality is said to be very good, I am having 2nd thoughts about the sensor size being so small.\n\nSo you like the Fuji X-Pro-1 best of all the \"pixel comparisons? Well, I do like the X100, so perhaps going with the next generation of Fuji would be best for me. Sigh - but I do LOVE a few of my Nikon-mount lenses and would just hate to give them up.\n\nSo - Plan B is to just wait a while, lol. See what Fuji does next. LOL"
