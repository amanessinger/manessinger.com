    "content": "Well, I do like the Fuji images, but they are problematic for other reasons. In the comparison widget at dpreview.com the RAW quality of the Fuji is exaggerated. The problem is, that Fuji files already have some color noise reduction before the data is even stored as a RAW file. Thus the advantage is not that big. That's not the problem though. The problem is, that their peculiar sensor pattern is extremely hard to demosaic without producing artifacts. At the moment the camera is supported by Adobe, but their demosaicing quality is really bad. \n\nAdd to that the other problems that people report, AF, user interface problems, responsiveness, add the price and the small number of lenses available, and suddenly the X-Pro 1 is not that exciting any more.\n\nThe reason why I am so satisfied with the OM-D is, that it is outright excellent in all areas that I need, without having any major faults in any other area."
