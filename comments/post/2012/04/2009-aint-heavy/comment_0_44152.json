    "content": "Andreas, I'm with you for downsizing weight-wise. I hate, tho, to trade in my Nikons and all the lenses. I've lived with Nikons for 30 years, first film and then digital. But, weight is a big factor for me these days. I rarely carry my tripod, as just the Nikon body and a couple of lenses are almost too much for me.\n\nSo perhaps if I downsize, then I'll feel more like carrying a tripod. But there are sooo many good little cameras popping onto the market every month now, that I feel in a quandary as to which to pick. And, as has been the case with the Nikons ever since the development of digital, as soon as I buy one, it's rapidly out-of-date. Nikon has developed some excellent small cameras, too, that I need to check out before making a decision.\n\nRight now, if you had to pick only one of the different cameras to keep that you have - which would it be?"
