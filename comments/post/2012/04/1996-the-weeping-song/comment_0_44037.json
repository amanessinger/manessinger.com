They tend to snuggle their way into our hearts, and even though they leave some day, they'll always be in our hearts and sooth the pain with happy and funny memories.\n\nMy cat was a Siamese. I wrote a short story - from his point of view, however. If you'd like to read it: <a href=\"http://www.tonebytone.com/fstory/tucker.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tucker's Tracks</a>. Perhaps it'll help lift your spirits a little."
