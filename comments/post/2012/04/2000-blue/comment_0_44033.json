    "content": "Well written! - \"Shutter Therapy. Therapy. Medicine. Healing. Health. Sanity.\" - The skill of stopping, it is important. Luckily the practice of taking photographs offers a way.\n\nIn a way, photography is a selfish thing - \"immersing myself in raw experience\" - but paradoxically it is also a selfless thing - \"stepping out of it\".\n\nThank you for inspiration, and encouragement!"
