I wanted an almost high-key look of cleanness, just as if the carriage and the bikes were in an evenly lit interior room of marble and white stucco. The dynamic range of the OM-D and the immense pliability of Adobe's new RAW process made it possible. I've added some artificial noise for effect but without necessity. Let's say I'm once more impressed."
