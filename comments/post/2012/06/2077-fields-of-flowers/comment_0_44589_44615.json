Mark would use a blurry black border, that's for sure. <a href=\"http://lightscrape.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juha</a>?\n\nWhat for me makes this images is the processing. I'm absolutely amazed by the pliability of Adobe's 2012 process. This is very much like HDR tone mapping. What I've done here is to distribute the tones much like you would see them in a painting. Think of 17th century Dutch floral paintings. Being able to do that makes Lightroom a killer application for me. Same would of course be true for Photoshop CS6, but Lightroom does 95% of what I need, and I have not found anything yet in the remaining 5%, that could not be done in my Photoshop CS3."
