Interesting, in earlier times people tried to make everything beautiful, even if it was an instrument of death. On the other hand, people kept their items for a long time and they were also built to last a long time. The question is: would making planned obsolescence a crime give us back the beauty of everyday things?\n\n@Cedric : Yeah, you can't step into the same river twice, and that's a real good thing ðŸ™‚"
