    "content": "I am always instantly attracted to photos like these, of walls and construction. I like the stains found on old walls, it's like abstract art to me. And I like the lines and shapes offered by such images. \n\nBTW, I bought LR4 on your praise. I like it even if it's complete overkill for the number of photos that I take. It certainly does do what it does wonderfully. One thing I can't work out though is that when I export photos I've worked on to my drive they look darker than how I did them in LR. Are you finding the same issue? I'm sure I'll get use to it soon and I enjoy working with it."
