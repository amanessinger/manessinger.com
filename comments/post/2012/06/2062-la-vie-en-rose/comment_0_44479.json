    "content": "A wonderful example of how to break the rule of thirds. Nicely done. However the second photo is the one that has my attention. There is an element of abstraction that's been achieved without taking anything away (the usual technique of creating an abstract) but rather by adding the element of water drops. I wonder what it says about me that as much as I like your image of the rose (and not only for the broken rule) I would be more likely to place your second image on a wall than the first.\n\nBTW, La Vie En Rose is one of my favourite songs and Lauper is a great singer but I never liked her rendition of this song. I always find myself returning to Piaf or Armstrong whenever I want to listen to it."
