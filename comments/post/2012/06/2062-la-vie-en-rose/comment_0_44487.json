It took me some experimenting in Lightroom to find a tonal balance that would emphasize mainly the water drops. I think I found it 😄”\n\nYes I think you did. I really like the tonal values of this image. I'm no fan of so called modern architecture believing that Friedensreich Hundertwasser was right in his saying that the straight line is godless, but this picture has feeling."
