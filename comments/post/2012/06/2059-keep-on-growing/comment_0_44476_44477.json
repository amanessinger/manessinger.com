Even the ISO 6400 kitchen wall. I see only three things that I don't like:\n\n<ol>\n <li>It seems to be sluggish in some respects</li>\n <li>It has no EVF</li>\n <li>It does not go as wide as 24 mm</li>\n</ol>\n<br /><br />\nI don't buy it because the OM-D is portable enough for me. I don't need anything smaller or lighter."
