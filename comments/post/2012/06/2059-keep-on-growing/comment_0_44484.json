The RX100 appears to be only slightly larger and has similar functionality and ergonomics to the S100, hence the \"direct competitor\". What I hope is that the image quality of the RX100 is a noticably better than the S95 / S100 ... and no \"gotcha's\". The idea of a new player in the serious compact camera market is wonderful news! ðŸ™‚"
