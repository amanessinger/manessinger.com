    "content": "Is it possible for two photographs to take the same street photos? Is it possible for the same photographic artist to do it? How reproducible are the same images from the same photo  by different post processing artists? How possible are the same images from the same photo by the SAME post processing artist? \n\nEven if only POV was our only tool - the only variable... I'm guessing that my idea/feeling would never wind up inside your camera if we prowled the same spot at the same time. Which brings me to the cosmic question I've often asked artists from every genre (fiction, screen plays, musical composition, performing arts, painting, sculpting, and yes... photography... The question? How do you know when you are done? How do you know when you've exhausted all interpretation of an idea... of a feeling? Of all ideas or feelings which might be focused upon just the decision to identify a POV? Here you show us two days at the same site. Proving my quandary... How do you know when you're done? Done even with the ideas/feelings that you can imagine in just this site? How? Hmmmmmmm?"
