    "content": "I'm a great friend of abstract photography (just published my new ebook on that topic) and being an Olympus photographer too I am able to confirm that the Olympus (Zuiko) lenses are first class indeed. If you like the 40-150’s you would be fond of the 50-200’s tele lens or in the wide angle sector the 7-14’s. That is a very astonishing lens with an angle like 14-28 mm on a so called \"full frame\" camera. It is equal of angle and a very fine lens for architectural and landscape photography."
