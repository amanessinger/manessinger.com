    "content": "Well, in ultra-wide land I really, really crave for the Panasonic 7-14. All pictures I've seen are nothing but excellent. It's just damn expensive and I guess for this year the Nikon D300 with my Sigma 8-16 will do.\n\nAnd there's more advantage at the moment. The E-P2 can't do any useful bracketing. Three frames at 1EV are simply not enough for HDR. The OM-D on the other hand will have 7 frames at 1 EV. On the D300 I could go up as high as 9 frames but from experience 7 are enough. I frequently find myself using HDR along with ultra-wide in outdoor scenarios, especially in winter. See for instance the series beginning with \"<a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2011/02/1595-frozen.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1595 â€“ Frozen</a>\" through to \"<a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2011/03/1600-frozen-vi.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1600 â€“ Frozen VI</a>\". Sure, they are artificial, they are obviously HDR, but I think they are not overdone. Impossible to do without proper bracketing.\n\nWe'll see. I may deliberately keep ultra-wide for the D300. For this year my budget is used up, and what I do next year, the Panasonic 7-14 or the  Voigtlaender 25/0.95, I really don't know ðŸ™‚"
