Oh, it's going away and probably a good thing to have nature say, \"slow down Ted.\" But still I wish we could have taken some of the fury out of the bitterness you guys had this season which would at least allow me an excuse for getting what used to be thought of as a cold-induced disease. \n\nOh well, an enforced afternoon inside's given me the chance to visit old friends and totally enjoy their feelings. As always Andreas, YOU ROCK! This image is haunting."
