    "content": "The novel “The Stars Like Dust” was translated into Finnish in 2011, and I read it for nostalgic reasons. Or tried to, as I had to stop at halfway through. (I did check the last pages to see the end.)\n\nIt really isn't a worthwhile book except for maybe learning how badly even Asimov can write. I very much liked the initial Foundation books, though not the last ones."
