In fact JustHost .com is US based, and while I currently pay more, it is only for an SSL certificate that I currently don't use. Hmm ... must remember to not renew it next time ðŸ˜„\n\nThe problem is, they are all OK as long as there are no problems. You get what you pay for, and what we pay is really very, very little. I think I would have a more stable environment if I had not a shared account but a private server, but then, that's much more expensive than I want to spend on something that I could have for free on Blogger/Picasa/Flickr. It's a compromise and because this blog does not generate any income, it's not viable spending more."
