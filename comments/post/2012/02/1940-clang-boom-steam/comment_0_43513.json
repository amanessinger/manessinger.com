    "content": "I looked at the specs on the D800 and it's not on my radar. I'm not really interested in having more pixels, albeit smaller pixels. I was 'expecting' a mini-D4, right in line with Nikon's usual release strategy. This camera seems more suitable for studio or wedding photographers, at least that's my guess. I'm hoping for a price drop in the D700 so that I might pick one of those up, assuming that I might want to by some FX glass. ðŸ™‚ I'm not looking for any more small sensor cameras."
