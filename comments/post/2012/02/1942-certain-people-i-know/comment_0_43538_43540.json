I've been photographing for little more than seven years now and it is already a deeply ingrained habit, but that's nothing against 30 or more years.\n\nWith Gary it was different. He spent his life with Janet and he documented that life. Nothing unexpected, just what he had to see coming, and then it came, just like it comes to all of us, some time. This kind of documentation is something that seems quite natural to me, at least for a photographer."
