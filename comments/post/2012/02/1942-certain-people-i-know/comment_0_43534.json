Sometimes you won't know something isn't right for you until you try it, but then again sometimes you do.  \n\nIt's an old saying that you should photograph what you love, and I think that is true in spades.  Those pictures will have much more \"soul\" to them than anything where you are not really into it.  I genuinely love photographing people (not always, but sometimes strangers), so that feels right for me.  But if I didn't, I don't think it would be right to force it on myself.  Shooting time is too precious for that."
