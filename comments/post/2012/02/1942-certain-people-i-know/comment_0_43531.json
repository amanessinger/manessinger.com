    "content": "Thanks, Andreas. \n\nWhat Mark pointed out with acute, provocative words you set back into the correct (for me) framework. I would never deny that there are reasons to picture hardship, suffering, death, and photographers like James Nachtwey have done it in perfection. But for a good part I cannot bring myself to even view more than a limited number of these pictures - exactly as you said:\n\n“Emotionally charged”? It will happen some time, thank you, I am glad for every day in between.\n\nMost probably it is a question of personal development how to deal with this challenge. I am not there yet."
