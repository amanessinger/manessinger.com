This camera has crossed my mind also, not only because it resembles the SLRs with which I started but also because this one seems to have most things right. But the devil is in the details... \n\nMy ideal combo would have 2-3 pancake lenses, one 12 or 14 mm, and one 17 or 20 mm. And then Olympus 45/1.8 which you mention, or perhaps a macro lens. However, then I start thinking how to carry all this stuff... and my interest wanes."
