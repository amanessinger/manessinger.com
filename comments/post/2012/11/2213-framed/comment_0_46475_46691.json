    "content": "I also prefer primes. Not strongly, but I do. My reason is not necessarily quality though, it's mostly the bigger aperture.\n\nThe fastest zooms are normally constant f2.8, FT has some constant f2.0 lenses for insane prices, but just look at my current setup for MFT: 12/2.0, 45/1.8, 75/1.8, and all three together weigh around 500g. That's nothing, and at the same time they are faster than all zooms on the market.\n\nAnd it's not only that. I like the contemplative aspect of zooming with your feet. Interestingly I also like changing lenses. With the small size and light weight of MFT you can do that without setting down one of the two lenses. It's perfectly (no, actually reasonably) safe and I can do it while walking."
