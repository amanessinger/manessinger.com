When I mention this to people (who are themselves photographers) they look at me like I'm weird. Why would anyone do that, they ask. But even though I don't have an EVF, if I know I'm recording B&amp;W, then the world automatically looks B&amp;W to me. I see shapes and shadows more readily. It's hard to explain but it does make a difference. I imagine it's even more pronounced with your camera Andreas."
