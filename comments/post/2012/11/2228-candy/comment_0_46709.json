    "content": "Hi, Andreas.\n\nI sold a pair of Nikon D7000's and some expensive pro lenses and went into mirrorless with the E-M5 and haven't looked back.  Like you, I ended up with some spare money and bought a lot of really nice primes.  The Panasonic pancakes I had and sold also, but the Panasonic/Leica 25mm 1.4 is a gem.  You should definitely try it out as it has a lovely look to it in my opinion.  I have the Oly 75 and 45 f/1.8 and 12 f/2 as well and like them also.\n\nI am also waiting for some weather sealed \"pro\" lenses and did not take the bait either on the Pansonic offerings.  When I shoot weddings (which I do rarely to generate income for more gear, lol) not having a fast long zoom is a problem.  I am really looking forward to that Olympus 40-150 f/2.8 you mention.\n\nEnjoy your postings, but haven't felt motivated to comment.  Did want to put in a plug for the 25mm Panasonic.  It and the 75mm f/1.8 Oly are my favorites.  I used them together to shoot some frustratingly badly lit night sports and it's on my blog which I used as the URL link when I replied here.\n\nThanks,\nJohn"
