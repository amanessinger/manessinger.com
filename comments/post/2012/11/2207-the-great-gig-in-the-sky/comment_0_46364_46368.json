I mean, there is almost always a \"better\", but from a certain point on and for a certain purpose there is also a \"good enough\". The D200 was not \"good enough\", the D300 was.\n\nFrom my experiments with the Panasonic LX5 though, I knew how much easier it was to go \"light\". The LX5 was not \"good enough\", but in good light it was close. Then I tried the Olympus E-P2. Bigger, heavier, worse ergonomics than both the D300 and the LX5, image quality about as good as the D200. Not \"good enough\".\n\nThe OM-D is \"more than good enough\". It's better than the D300, much lighter itself, and especially the lenses are much smaller and much lighter than everything on the Nikon side. At the same time they are excellent.\n\nI strongly believe that m4/3 is the sweet spot when it comes to compact systems. The quality is there and, opposed to most of the competition, the lenses are substantially smaller than everything for APS-C. Look at the Sony NEX7. It's a fine, small camera. Its image quality is even better than that of the OM-D, but only slightly so, mostly due to added resolution. And now add lenses. Soon the size and weight advantage of the small body is diminishing, because the lenses don't get smaller. Add a tele and you have an unbalanced, front-heavy mess. \n\nLook at the Sony 50/1.8 OS, the closest lens to the fabulous Olympus 45/1.8. It's in no way heavy, but it still weighs almost twice as much as the Olympus. Same with the Sony 24/1.8 and the Panasonic 20/1.7. Add the fact that Sony still has almost no native lenses and that m4/3 has plenty of everything but super-teles. But then, I didn't buy super-teles for Nikon either ðŸ™‚"
