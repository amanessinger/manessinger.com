    "content": "I haven't really thought much about long lenses so far. The 40-150 is extremely light, cheap and quite capable in good light, and at the moment I still have the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro for Nikon with Novoflex adapter, a heavy monster of a lens, but beautifully sharp wide open. I'll sell that though.\n\nI consider getting a used Nikon 180/2.8 AI-S. That would be more or less in the price range of what I can get for the Sigma, but it is designed for manual focus and thus has a longer focus throw. A few months ago I even saw a Canon FD 300/2.8 manual focus lens of extremely high quality for slightly below 1000â‚¬. Of course I didn't buy it, but I may get something like that if I want extreme reach. Otoh, once you're there you can also start thinking about the Oly 150/2.0 ðŸ™‚\n\nBut again, at the moment it is all geared toward light weight. Long lenses and light weight, that's either an extreme compromise or a contradiction ðŸ™‚"
