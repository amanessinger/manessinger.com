    "content": "Thank you for this explanation!\n\nI myself use the 70-300 mm f/4-5.6 lens. That is a \"standard lens\" which means not in the \"pro\" or \"top pro\" series but for me it is good enough. It is not heavy, sharp enough and really quick focusing doesn't matter for me most of the time. (I shoot landscapes and abstract photography and many times I use the manual focus.) Also I like to use it in the distance around 1 meter because of the possibility to clearly separate the subject from the background. There are some fine portraits in my stock also.\n\nIf one wants quick auto focus, better lens speed and finest quality (and water and dust protection!) the 50-200 mm f/2.8-3.5 seems to be an excellent choice. And with the tele converter EC 14 you still have a lens speed of f/4 to f/5 at the range of 70-280 mm.\n\nBut all this is FourThirds (which I use) and for you there is an other lens range as you know certainly. (And an adapter for FT lenses.) The mFT 75-300mm f/4.8-6.7 does not suit you?"
