But then when you stopped, so did the slow blur, and it lost its magical quality.\n\nI really \"dig\" the 3rd image - the lone tree with the sun's light at just the right angle to bring out the three-dimensional qualities in the whole scene. It's a lovely place and your image makes me want to go sit under that tree and just laze the afternoon away."
