I don't copy their styles, but both have been inspirations over the years, and if you enjoy square images and don't already follow their blogs, I suggest you have a look at them.\n\nAs to sizes: I've just added a Flickr icon to the side bar of my blog. It takes you to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/amanessinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">my Flickr stream</a> and there you can always download full size images, released under CC BY-NC-ND."
