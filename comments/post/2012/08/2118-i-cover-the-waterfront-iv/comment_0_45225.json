Once I even took my camera in the surf after placing my camera in a plastic bag with a rubber band around the lens. I kept the camera above the waves (which were not overly big) and shot in auto while guessing at the composition because I could not use the viewfinder. I found it fun though my shots did not turn out as well as yours."
