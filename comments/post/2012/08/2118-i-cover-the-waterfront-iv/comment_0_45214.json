    "content": "Just the other day I was discussing swimming technique with a colleague at work, who is 60+ and started swimming rather late. He has been taking courses and said that it will take half a year of practice to learn freestyle swimming basics properly. And he is still keen on learning, taking advanced courses now.\n\nWhile researching the topic of swimming on the net I ran into a couple of heated exchanges on discussion forums, where the basic question was always the same: \"I try to float in water but I always sink below the surface, am I doing something wrong?\" And then two answers were given: 1) \"Just relax and you will find the right posture and then you will float.\" 2) \"It is not a matter of relaxation but basic physic: are you heavier than water or not?\" At this point the discussion heated up and the original question was forgotten.\n\nWell, I do float (enough fat in the body...), but my style of swimming is very ugly. Well, maybe some day I'll take a course or two to learn the proper way."
