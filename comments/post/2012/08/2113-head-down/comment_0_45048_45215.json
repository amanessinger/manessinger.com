The sunlit part of the water does not come across as naturally as I would like it to do. I guess I would have to tone it down. Really, I'm not sure. The shadowed water is unevenly lit (actually dodged), so probably you would like a thorough job better. Maybe I come back to it. At the moment I can't, I'm in Vienna and without the master file."
