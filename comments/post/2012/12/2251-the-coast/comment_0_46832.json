Andreas, I thought that the whole shift in your focus, pardon the pun, this year has been to go lighter and lighter!\n\nI don't take a bag any more, even a little one. Because whatever carrying space I have access to inevitably gets filled - and therefore, heavier!\n\nBTW, I love your little froggie. Takes me waaaay back to my kiddie days when I loved playing in the snow!"
