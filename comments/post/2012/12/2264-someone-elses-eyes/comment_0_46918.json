    "content": "Love that first \"construction site\" photo. And tho it's an interesting question, sometimes I don't think too much about it and consider what I'm doing as \"documenting\". Would you for instance call my photo at http://www.flickr.com/photos/wjlonien/7045539423/ art? I don't know, really. But the creativity isn't only about framing, it's also about the light, the moment, and everything - after all, the (part of the) statue I photographed there surely wasn't made inside of this church. So who created art? The original sculptor without any doubt, but what about the people who decided where to put that statue, how the light would fall onto it on certain days and times - or the photographer as well? I liked what I saw, so I took a picture of it. If that is art or not, others can decide; I won't care too much.\n\nHave a great new 2013!"
