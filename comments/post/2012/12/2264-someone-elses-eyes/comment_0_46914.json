    "content": "This is the eternal question of \"what is art?\". What you did and what has been done with the Street-View images is without a doubt creative but I cannot bring myself to accepting it as art. Having said that I do accept that under the common understanding of what art is, many people would accept it as such. I have often wished for a new term that would separate what is commonly seen as art and those all-too-rare works which have given us paradigm shifts in how we view the world and ourselves. A huge portion of what passes off as art today is merely remakes of what others have done before, not just in terms of the works themselves but also of the ideas being presented. I guess in the end it's all semantics. It all comes down to personal interpretation and as such the discussion is perhaps of no practical importance."
