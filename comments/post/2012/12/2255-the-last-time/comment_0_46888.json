    "content": "I sympathize with you when it comes to the weight of camera equipment. I recently upgraded to a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, and I got a 24â€“105mm lens to replace the lighter-weight 17-40mm lens I'd been using on all my APS-C cameras. My camera bag is now just heavy enough that it's started making my shoulders and back hurt. I can't say I like the price of \"progress\" in this case."
