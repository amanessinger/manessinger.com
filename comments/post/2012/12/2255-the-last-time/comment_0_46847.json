I just got an OM D and love the image quality I am getting with the 20mm 1.7 Lumix. I also have the 12-50 kit zoom but have not used it much yet as it adds quite a bit to the size of the camera. I am tempted by the Panasonic 12-35mm/F2.8 which is shorter but probably heaver. But maybe a mid prime would be a better choice.\n\nAt any rate I see that you use a wrist strap... I have been contemplating that as the shoulder strap adds some bulk and is not really needed if you have a small shoulder bag. What strap do you use? The straps intended for point-and-shoots seem a bit small but the OP/TECH I used on my DSLR seems too big.\n\nI like the shot with this post. Nice work as usual.\n\nJohn"
