    "content": "It is interesting to watch the transitions of various photographers as they move to smaller cameras, ditching the DSLR. For now, I'll hold onto mine because I still like the larger sensor, depth of field control, and the tripod even though I probably do that kind of photography only about 20% of the time.\n\nRecently, while on vacation, I saw an OM-D and my interest was piqued, to be sure; however, since I have the NIkon P-510 and it does all that I need, I'm not in the market ... at this time."
