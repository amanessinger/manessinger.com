    "content": "Here's something to wet your appetite, I'm using a Tokina 11-16 on my OM-D with a shift adapter. And because I always crop to 1:1, or at worst to 6:7 format, it's very sharp. I've also got the 7-14 plus both the f2.8 zooms. My wife has gone down the prime route like you. It's a great system and I don't miss my full frame DSLR at all."
