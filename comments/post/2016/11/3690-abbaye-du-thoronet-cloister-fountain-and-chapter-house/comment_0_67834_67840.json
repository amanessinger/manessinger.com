You just hold it at arm's length, and that mostly solves the problem with your feet.\n\nPost processing? Well, not as you do it. These days I mostly fit the histogram into the range between 0 and 255, a little bit dodging and burning, some color work. All things that I can do in Lightroom. Maybe sometimes cloning out my toes ðŸ˜„"
