That's one of the big lessons one learns over the years. \n\nPolitburo => Communism => ? \n\nThe implications are completely random when Politbuero can mean the buddies of the local dictator. And to start with, Communism was not meant to be a dictatorship originally. It also implied certain guarantees and rights, all attributes that it lost to various degrees in different places and over time. In some places not more than a fascist dictatorship was left. See North Korea. In others like China we see a \"communist\" society move straight into kind of a capitalism, that again is completely different from what the word means in the US. \n\nWords are problematic and people are told to not question their \"official\" meanings. That's how dogmatism as a tool of any ruling group or class makes us believe that we've always been at war with Eastasia. And most people are fine with that, as long as things are acceptable (a word without static meaning by itself!) or someone claims to do something that is declared to make things better. Even if it doesn't make sense."
