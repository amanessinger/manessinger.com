It was quite remarkable to hear her tell about those things calmly, clearly, stressing the humanitarian viewpoint, without going into the politics.\n\nRecently I have been browsing through books about Lee Miller, who was a multitude of things, one of them being a war correspondent for Vogue during the Second World War. I looked at her photographs of the horrors of the concentration camps at Buchenwald and Dachau, and I wondered at how she could stay sane after taking such photographs of atrocities. But if no-one had done it, we wouldn't have known."
