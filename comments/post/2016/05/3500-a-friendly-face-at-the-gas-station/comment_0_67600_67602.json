    "content": "Well, on a larger, scale refugees are a problem that has to be solved at the root. The root is, that the end of colonialism was mostly symbolic. We stopped governing them, but our corporations still exploit them and our governments more or less openly support that. The USA meddled everywhere they suspected communists (which actually meant everything bad for their corporations), the French meddle in North Africa, the Brits do it in parts of Africa and the Middle East, the Russians are interested in for instance keeping their military presence in Syria, and so on and so on. If any former colonial empire has stopped meddling, then it is, because they lost their power to do so, but in all cases other powers have stepped in.\n\nTherefore, as long as global politics don't change, the refugees will come, and along with them will be some who just try to escape a desperate economic situation. Whatever we do, it will always be hard to tell them apart. Whether we should even try to, that's a moral and philosophical problem. In any case we (or better: those in power around here) are collectively profiting from both types of misery. \n\nIn the present situation it boils down to a simple choice: turn everyone away, letting them drown or starve, or take them and accept that you'll get the odd criminal as well. Hofer is on one side of that moral chasm, VdB on the other. But again, it's a global problem.\n\nSyria is special in only one regard: it is close enough to Europe, to make the problem visible to us. Think of the millions of displaced people wandering around in Africa. They don't bother us,  we don't see them, nobody but them has a problem. You'll get to read one or two articles in the better newspapers per year, and those are ignored by 99.9% of us."
