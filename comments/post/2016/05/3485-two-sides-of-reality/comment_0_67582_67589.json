As to the lens' color rendering, well, forget about it. Colors in my images are always what I see fit. I practically never post unedited images, and editing in my case always means maximizing use of the histogram. This is bound to completely change colors. In a later step I then re-balance the colors. The influence of the lens is negligible ðŸ˜„"
