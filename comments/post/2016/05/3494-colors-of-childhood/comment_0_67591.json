    "content": "Sometimes I wonder if the downtrend of visitors to a site has to do with loss of vigour on the creator's side, loss of interest on the viewer's side or simply due to the effects of dilution from the fact that every day there are more and more new sources of interest on the web while the hours in a day remain static.\nFor myself, I am still interested in photography though only as a viewer (I stopped taking pictures over a year ago) and as a viewer I am still interested in blogs such as yours though I would be satisfied with just following you on Flickr. As my occupation requires me to work on a computer all day long, I find myself reluctant to spend still more time in front of a screen once I am at home. As such I tend to focus my attention to a small number of web sites. It takes me little more than an hour a week to get through the various blog posts and perhaps another hour to get through the art and photography Tumblrs I also follow. This is more than enough for me and while I know there are some great new sites and brilliant new photographers, I only follow someone new when I stop following someone else (either because they've stopped blogging or their interest/style has diverged from mine too much).\nLike you I prefer to read books these days though unlike you, \"staying competitive\" is a futile endeavour at my age so I tend to only read fiction.\nShould you stop blogging? That is your decision. Should you stop blogging daily? You could though you would need a new by-line ðŸ™‚\nAnyway, I hope your work eases up a little so that at least you get more time to devote to other, more personal endeavours."
