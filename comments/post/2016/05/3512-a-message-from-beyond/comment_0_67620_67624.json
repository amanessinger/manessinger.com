Perfect headstart for all the populists ðŸ™‚\n\nAnd of course it does not help that some of the problems they point out are not only real, but also very hard. Fix migration at the root? But how? \n\nWhat would a Third World worth living in mean to our own standard of living?\n\nWho around here would support the necessary measures? We don't even manage to fix our own inequality problem.\n\nIt's not that it couldn't be done, but it's hard to see how it can be done in a democracy. On the other hand, it's even harder to see why turning away from democracy could possibly change anything for the better. The \"benign dictator\" may have happened a few times in history, but none of those few could establish anything like a permanent legacy. Thus it has to be democracy, and then we're back to lobbying and the power of money. Damn it ðŸ™‚"
