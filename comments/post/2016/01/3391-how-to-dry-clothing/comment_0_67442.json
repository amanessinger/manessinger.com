    "content": "An interesting consideration Andreas, one that I have contemplated myself as I start the year in which I could legitimately retire. I doubt I will actually retire anytime soon (perhaps in 10 years or so) but this question of where to live when commuting and work are no longer in the equation. I am attracted to those places I have visited as a tourist but as you intimate, it is unlikely that I would actually want to live there. Then there are those places where I have worked and lived at some point and while I feel more confident about being less bias towards those places I wonder if somehow I only remember the good parts. My guess is that I will end up staying right where I have lived most of my life ðŸ™‚"
