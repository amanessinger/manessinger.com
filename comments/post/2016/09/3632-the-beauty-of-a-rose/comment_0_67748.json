    "content": "Your photos are exquisite. I am a struggling novice photographer. I was researching questions online that I had about shooting RAW with my Nikon D3000 and I read your reply to a question someone had posted way back in 2009.  You were so helpful and courteous with your reply.  I wanted to reach out to you.  I was hoping you would have some advice for me. I live in Oklahoma. I was mostly wanting to take photos of the surrounding countryside and our children. I recently completed a 24 hour course in Photoshop. I have realized there's much I don't know.  I love the art of photography but I am a busy, working wife and mom of 4. Do you know of any free sites or online courses that would help me learn?  Thanks so much for your time!"
