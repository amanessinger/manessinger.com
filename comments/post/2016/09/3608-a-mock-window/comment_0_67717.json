    "content": "I like figuring out aperture, shutter speed and ISO manually but as for manual focusing, I'm with you, it's distracting more than anything else. interestingly though if I'm shooting a film camera which is entirely manual then for some reason I don't find it as annoying. Still, I appreciate it when I go back to an auto-focus camera."
