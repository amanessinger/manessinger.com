That you don't write about the latest and greatest gear is neither here nor there for me. I lost interest in the details of camera gear a long time ago. I recently got my daughter an old Minolta 35mm film camera. Well, maybe not so old, it does have auto-focus (which she doesn't use), but it reminded me of how simple cameras once used to be. This isn't to say that old is better than new or anything so foolish, but it's simply an observation on the differences in the technology. Anyway, all I'm really saying is that gear talk is only really worthwhile to me when it's discussed from a personal point of view, as you do here on your blog. Which is probably why I keep coming back. That and the photos. And your musings on just about everything else. I reckon that as long as it keeps being fun for you, I'll keep visiting. It's not a bad way to spend a few minutes each day. At least until we're all dead ðŸ™‚"
