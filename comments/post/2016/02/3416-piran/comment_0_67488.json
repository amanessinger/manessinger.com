    "content": "\"Slovenia had no Serbian population and no historic ties to Serbia.\"\n\nActually there was and is a Serbian population in Slovenia. But many Serbs (and other non-Slovenians) became the \"erased people\" where Slovenia took away their rights once it declared independence. People were left without pensions, insurance, legal access, etc. \nThe main Slovenia bank also kept the deposits of non-Slovenia Yugoslavs and refused to allow these people their money back to this day. \nCroatia had a major lawsuit against Slovenia to try and get Croats' money back, but I think it failed."
