  "content": "Interestingly no, I didn't. I had a short flirt with my father's a film camera when I was 12. Unfortunately I dropped it and something broke. That was it for ten years. My father was not a passionate photographer. He just bought the thing because my mother wanted \"pictures of the children\".\n\nIn my twenties I was mostly in Vienna, and in that time the expansion of Klagenfurt, my hometown, erased the landscape of my childhood.\n\nI sometimes speak with people about the phenomenon, and it seems that some have not been hit so much. If you've grown up in one of Vienna's noble western districts, it's mostly that small shops and some restaurants have closed, others have opened. The change of the landscape happened a century earlier.\n\nAnyway. Good to see you on this side :)",
