You've specified an email address, and - lo and behold - I have forgotten to automatically strip them in my comment harvester :) It's fixed now.\n\nAs to the emojis: that you mention Safari, makes it clear you work on a Mac. Lacking polish, that's never been a problem on a Mac. No, I suppose the anonymous fan, who shared his emoji problems, is working on Linux or on an older version of Windows. Windows 10 has no problems either, and on Linux you can seemingly install some extra font and then the problem is solved.\n\nAnyway. I see no good option but to just go ahead and let time work :D",
