  "content": "Interesting. You seem to have no problem with the comments form. It uses CSS grid, a standard that was just released in February 2018. Looks like you have a modern browser.\n\nUnicode emoji rendering seems to be a matter of fonts. Have a look at https://superuser.com/questions/183446/emoji-characters-not-displaying-correctly-on-windows-7\n\nSee also the second answer in that thread. It recommends installing the \"Symbola\" font. Purportedly that fixes Problems with emojis. They won't be in color though. Sorry :)",
