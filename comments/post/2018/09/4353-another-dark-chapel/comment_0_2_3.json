It's weird. Olympus has it, Sony has it in FF, the new Nikon Z will have it in FF as well, only Canon stabilizes Lenses as they always did. I think it's a stupid move, because there's no reason why you shouldn't do it both ways. In fact my 12-100 lens, that I used during our walk in Vienna (pictures following in October) is stabilized, and that is in addition to the sensor stabilization. It's really crazy what I can hold with that lens :)",
