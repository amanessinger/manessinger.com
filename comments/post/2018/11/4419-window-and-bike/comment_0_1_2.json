  "content": "Oh dear, thanks, but that's totally undeserved today. Actually I have almost stopped taking photographs at all. This blog is running on what I take on travels and short trips. It's enough to fuel the blog, but it is not enough to keep up imagination and the spirit to experiment and creating novel things.\n\nIt's a choice though. At the moment I create something big at work, and the more fun work is, the less I can put into photography. What you see today, that is more than a year old. The material gets thinner towards the end of 2017, and it gets dramatically thinner when we come to 2018. Again, a few trips will save the blog :)",
