I should go and ... still, the more time passes, the less penetrable the border gets, the more information \"Homeland Security\" requests, the more I feel resistance.\n\nMy passwords? Really? My online accounts? Seriously? I have hundreds of them! How should I know? And why should I tell them?\n\nCan I bring a computer? What if they take it \"for inspection\" and hand it back to me after 10 minutes? What should I do then? Wipe it? Or will the trojan sit far below the operating system level? It's possible and I know it.\n\nTed, we need to talk. I need to understand your country. More than ever. What about Skype, Google Hangout, Cisco WebEx or even -  God forbid - Facetime :)\n\n... and then we had a long talk via Facetime. I have no idea why I didn't try that earlier :D",
