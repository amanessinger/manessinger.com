And for that I owe you a big thank you for giving me the idea in the first place.  <br/>The Annie Lennox lyrics are a perfect fit for this image.  Just for fun I did a search of my own library and came up with R.L. Burnside's Shake'em On Down which is on A Ass Pocket of Whiskey.  I would love to hear the story behind that one.<br/>Oh, and the image is pretty cool too."
