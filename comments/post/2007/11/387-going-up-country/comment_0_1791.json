The lighting looks like set from a big budget Hollywood flick of the 50s. Last week a late night movie ran on the Turner Cable Network: Brigadoon. The announcer explained that the director, Vincente Minelli apparently was not given sufficient money to go to a location shoot in Scotland forcing him to do everything in the California studios. <br/><br/>Gene Kelley, Cyd Charisse, and Van Johnson sang and danced their little hearts out in a super detailed scenic that Minelli labored over.<br/><br/>He obsessed the details carefully lighting every millimeter of the scenes, arranging each leaf or twig to create creations which looked eerily like this image. And you mined down with your HDR to discover Minelli's genius on your set... Nice.<br/><br/>Ted"
