    "content": "I did not mean that JPEGs are really protected from editing, but for a professional they would be less useful than a PNG. Actually I don't really care. If someone is so desperate to steal my images, oh well.<br/><br/>Your color problem is due to color spaces. Do the following: <br/><br/>Set the color space on the camera to sRGB. This influences the JPEGs only. RAW is still raw sensor data before any interpretation at all.<br/><br/>Make sure that whatever you post-process and then save is converted to 8bit (JPEG is an 8bit format, but that's OK for display purposes, the screen is 8bit as well) and convert the color space from whatever you edit in (e.g. Adobe RGB) to sRGB. sRGB is the color space that all programs assume that are not color managed, i.e. most of the internet browsers.<br/><br/>Make sure that you CONVERT color spaces and not ASSIGN sRGB. This makes a difference. Converting from Adobe RGB (bigger color space) to sRGB (smaller) preserves the look of the colors, assigning produces files that are less vivid, just what you have experienced.<br/><br/>If you only work for displaying on screen, you can avoid the trouble by using sRGB throughout. <br/><br/>Oh, and when you convert from a smaller color space to a bigger one, use \"relative colorimetric\" as  \"rendering intent\", but for converting down from big to small, you have to use \"perceptual\", otherwise out-of-gamut colors will be clipped.<br/><br/>Hmm ... I guess this was sufficiently incomprehensible. Oh well, color management is a mess. As I said, you can avoid it altogether by using sRGB everywhere, and that is certainly the simplest choice."
