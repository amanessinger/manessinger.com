    "content": "Well, for someone who is reluctant to reveal personal details on the Internet, this is quite a personal question ðŸ™‚)<br/><br/>Am I \"intense\"? Hmm ... putting the association with the Nespresso ad aside, I'd think in a way yes. It depends on what you mean. I am certainly radical and passionate in what I do. An edited image a day for 404 days in a row, that needs some passion, I can tell ya ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This has always been the same with all my obsessions. I have spent tons of time playing computer games, but in a way that made a friend of mine say, I don't actually play these games, I'm sightseeing. This visual obsession made me turn over from playing games to constructing game levels, and I did it with the same passion.<br/><br/>It's only three years ago that I began photographing, but it seems this folly is here to stay."
