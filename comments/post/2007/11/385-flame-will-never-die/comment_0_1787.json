    "content": "Three amazing images.  I can see why you chose the fall colours over the others but each one could easily stand on its own as an image of the day.  I like the white tree trunks in the first.  They are very effective in leading the eye upward. The circular tracks on the frost covered meadow also pull me into the picture and back to the fog which, in and of itself, is quite beautiful.  And the glass blocks, well, the play of the light both on the blocks and and on the wall is fantastic, as are the colours.  <br/><br/>Three feel good images and the music just accentuates that feeling.  How can anyone not be uplifted by zydeco/Cajun music?"
