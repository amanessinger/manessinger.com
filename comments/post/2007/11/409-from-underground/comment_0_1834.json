The lighting on this last one is ephemeral. But 408 reminds me of my favorite, the image I own of the light that sparkles in the night from an emerald surface. I've forgotten the number, but it'd be cooll if you could link to it for anyone who comes by. <br/><br/>Very fine work Andreas. Your eye is astonishing.<br/><br/>Ted"
