Contacts for me have never been an option I considered. The very idea of sticking something into my eye is beyond me. RK surgery one day, maybe, but contacts... gads no.<br/><br/>Now, this image is one that appeals to me on several levels. Color (still with the blue and gold, I see. I'm not complaining mind you, just making an observation!) and the simple, yet powerful composition. Nuff said."
