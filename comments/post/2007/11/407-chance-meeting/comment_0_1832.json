In many of my images I strive for healthy color contrasts, red/green, yellow/blue. Many times, like here, white balance is enough to achieve that, and sometimes I help along with Lab color and the \"Man from Mars\".<br/><br/>In case of this image it is not composition alone. I had to do a lot of cloning, because the ground was very distractingly dirty. <br/><br/>Andreas"
