It burst upon the trees and for the first time I realized that Fall had come to Lancaster County. <br/><br/>Maybe I wasn't paying attention these past weeks since returning from Europe. No, not true, I did try to go out two Sundays ago but couldn't find any leaves that had changed. So this is pretty sudden. Yeah, it is mid November so maybe Fall's a hair late, but we generally get high color here about now. <br/><br/>So it came as a shock to see your post. The snow seems so like a trip to the futute. Odd that our seasons are about as far apart as are our days. Just as you are six hours ahead of me every day, you seem about three to four weeks ahead of the colds or warms of nature's patterns. <br/><br/>I recall with jealousy watching Spring wash over your photographs when we were still slumping around in the slushy mud of late winter. Now you've beaten us into the flakes. <br/><br/>Someday it will become apparent to me how this happens. Till then, it's fun to watch the future happen here on your blog.<br/><br/>Ted"
