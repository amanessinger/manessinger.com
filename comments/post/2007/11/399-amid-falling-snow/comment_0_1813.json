You see, there are still colored leaves.<br/><br/>It somehow began when Summer was abruptly cut off in at the beginning of September. Last year I was swimming in Vienna around the end of September, this year it was the end of August. Carinthia was better, but weather in Vienna sadly did not recover.<br/><br/>Andreas"
