    "content": "And 20 years ago we talked about nothing but acid rain and the dying forests. Well, the forests are still with us, though there were changes to the worse indeed, only not with the magnitude and speed that the yellow press wanted us to believe. <br/><br/>I guess the same it's here: a little higher probability for hurricanes in the Caribbean and floods in Mexico, a bit more droughts in the Mediterranean, some insects north of the Alps that haven't been there in recorded history. Nothing too dramatic, probably not piling up to anything threatening in our lifetime, but what about the generations to come? All those processes, pollution and how to get rid of it, are very slow and hard to steer.<br/><br/>I mean, we all know that it's not a good idea to burn up all the oil on the planet and dump poison into the oceans, but we still think we could get away with it. Just like children stealing sweets in the supermarket, or the gambler who sees his fortunes dwindle and still feeds the slot machine. Isn't this stupid?"
