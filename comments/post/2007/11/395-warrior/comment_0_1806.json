Once upon a time I too bought UV filters to protect my large collection of first Miranda, then Hasselblad, and later Nikon lenses. There was a lot of expensive glass during my pro days. <br/><br/>And yet, I had a lot of trouble maximizing contrast and sharpness (related problems from a perceptioin standpoint), until I realized that the UV filters were BIG contributors to my problem - particularly with zooms. <br/><br/>Taking off the UVs resulted in appreciable differences, particularly in flat or oblique light. What I had done was to buy cheepie pieces of round glass to cover super expensive, carefully calibrated, computer designed lens assemblies. At that point, I stopped using any protective filters (althought I used appropriate specialty filters for the effects for which they were intended). <br/><br/>And in the thirty or so years since I've gone bare, I've never scratched a lens. Never, not once, zilch, zero....<br/><br/>Could it happen? Uh-huh. And I use lens caps obsessively. I don't know what percentage of degradation filters create, but they must... they must. <br/><br/>Now, suppose you do scratch your lens. Well think of the cool defraction effects you'll get, not to mention diffusion. How bad can that be? Heh heh heh...."
