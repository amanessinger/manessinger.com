When I had only one lens, the 18-200, I depended strongly on it, and any damage would have been a problem, because at that time the lens was still very hard to get. In normal operation I see no difference between with filter and without, but I admit that the filter may have its share when it comes to flares and ghosts. <br/><br/>Still, I feel better with filter. May be due to my habit of accidentally touching the front element ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>(Michael) This is my second copy. The first had a severe front focus problem. It would not auto-focus to infinity below f8. It's a sign of how I use this lens (mostly macro), that it took me two weeks to recognize ðŸ™‚"
