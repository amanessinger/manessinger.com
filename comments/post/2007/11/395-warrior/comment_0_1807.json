(especially the foreground)<br/><br/>I used to have a copy of the Sigma 20mm years ago (I believe I mentioned this already... or maybe not). But my copy was nothing approaching the quality of yours. In fact, I would not use it unless stopped down to at least f5.6, where it was ok. Yours seems to be wonderfully sharp wide-open. You gotta hate the sample variation. If I had bought from a reputable company and not ebay I would have tried returning it for another copy, instead I used it for a time and resold it. Your images with it always make me want to try another copy."
