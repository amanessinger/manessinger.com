    "content": "Have you ever eaten a Twizzler? Do they sell them where you are? They're made about five or six miles from where I'm sitting here in Lancaster County. This is a place where candy comes from.<br/><br/>Anywayzzzz.... I imagine that if you pull a Twizzler reeeeeeel thin. And place a candle behind it... you will get a gooey color like the orange/red  strip between your bridge and the water. <br/><br/>Hmmmm... on the other hand, I've heard that they do magical things in Vienna. Perhaps you merely took a picture of a bridge made from well pulled Twizzlers? <br/><br/>Regardless of whether it's the way it looked, or it's the way you conceived it.... you captured the magic."
