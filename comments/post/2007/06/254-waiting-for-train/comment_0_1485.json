I have so many that I've actually tried to swear off taking them... but every time I find that my lens, like a dowser's rod, gets tugged back. <br/><br/>Maybe it's because I want to be able to make an image of a window in a wall that is as pellucid as this? Yeah... that's it... I want to capture this sort of geometry covered in a patina of retro-aging. In the pellucid light of summer.<br/><br/>And I also want everyone scampering to their dictionaries to figure out wuddahell pellucid is.... Heh heh heh....<br/><br/>Great capture."
