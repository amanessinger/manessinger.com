It is not very controlled yet, but I'll definitely do more along these lines: using a flat HDR base with maximized local contrast and overlaying that with some of the original exposures. It gives the detail of HDR, but keeps more to a natural look than pure HDR tone-mapping.<br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>Andreas"
