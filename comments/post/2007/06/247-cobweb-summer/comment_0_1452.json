The portable light is such an utterly unremarkable everyday object and yet it is the perfect subject to anchor this shot because...on the other side of the dirty pane of glass is a completely fantastic mix of light and color looking something like a newly discovered nebula viewed by the Hubble space telescope. Perhaps you should title it Cobweb Nebula. The combination of the rose and blue colors with the extreme contrast of highlight and shadow are beautiful.  The framing of the shot with the window frame works very well indeed.  Great shot!"
