But I have to admit, I'd never thought about self titling images before (and I shall also admit that may not have been your intent... but take credit for it anyway... it's a powerful idea).<br/><br/>And now I'm wondering if I could pull that off. Hmmmm... <br/><br/>Oh the image?  The color palette alone makes it wonderful. And it is not alone. You deal well with complexity."
