The colors are beautiful and the overall composition is very well seen.<br/><br/>I'm interested in what the lens does to OOF highlights--a number of them develop a series of concentric circles of varying colors.  Is that a CA-like effect?  On the chrome of the chairs the effect is very attractive.  There is only one place, the fairly large circle under the brightest light, where it is a bit distracting.  The f/1.2 looks like a very interesting lens indeed."
