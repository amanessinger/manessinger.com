    "content": "Thanks. I never use images made with a polarizer without post-processing. A polarizer changes the colors so much, that automatic white balance does a bad job most of the time.<br/><br/>What we could compare effectively, is the result of this technique and the result of post-processing a polarized image. When I compare this current image and the not entirely sharp image that I've made some days before, I find that in processing this image I have probably overdone a little. Still, I think the effect is quite good. <br/><br/>I would not recommend it in general (the general recommendation is, to use a polarizer, it's so much less work), but there are situations where you don't have much choice. You may not have much headroom with shutter speed, you may travel light without a polarizer, or you may simply be too lazy as I was. For that it's OK ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Andreas"
