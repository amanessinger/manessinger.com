I read on this a bit and I guess it gives you alot of room to adjust your settings how ever you wish... yes?<br/><br/>How do you highlight the words in your blog and have them link?  I am having lots of trouble with this...all I have been able to do is highlight the name of the blog and attach a url to it.  I must be the dumbest person here as I can not figure it out.
