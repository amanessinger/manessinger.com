Just an easy cruise down the boulevard....<br/><br/>The geometry of the shot, as usual, is perfect and very simple.  How nicely the handle bar approaches but does not touch the sign post. The lines on the pavement recede.... <br/><br/>And then there are so many small details to linger over and examine.  The reflections on the chrome and in the beautiful black paint, the figure across the street, the bits of blue.  Yes, I think that obsession is an accurate description."
