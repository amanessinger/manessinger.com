    "content": "You really want to know? Well, let's see: At the moment the 18-200 is in repair (well, today I got a call that it's ready, but I was already in the train to Carinthia), so the Sigma 150/2.8 is my telephoto lens. Then I carry the 50/1.8, 50/1.2, 30/1.4, 10-20 and the Lensbaby with me, one of the lenses of course mounted on the D200, an MC-30 cable release, a head lamp and a small umbrella. No tripod. All this is in my LowePro Slingshot 300AW (or the 200AW when I'm in Carinthia).<br/><br/>In the 300AW there is still enough space for about 5-7 CDs or swimming trunks and a towel. It's very important never to be without a towel, you know?<br/><br/>Heavy? Yes, but not too bad. The 300AW is simply excellent. The best photo bag that I know of, still relatively small and bigger inside than one would expect from the outside. I never carry less. I don't change lenses all the time, many times not at all, but when I want to I need them."
