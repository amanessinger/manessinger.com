The other day I went out with what I thought would be everything I would need--D2X, several lenses, tripod, filters, etc.  When I tried to set up for a shot close to the ground, I discovered I had brought the long center column for my tripod rather than the short one.  I suppose that if I had brought the short column, I would have needed to set up a tall shot.<br/><br/>So, how much DO you carry to and from work?  I recently got a Fuji F31fd to have something that I can easily carry at all times.  It is not equivalent to a DSLR but certainly much better than nothing for the many times when you don't want to carry a large camera etc."
