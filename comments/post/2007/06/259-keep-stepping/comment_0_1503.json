You can do all of that color things directly in the RAW converter and then combine, overlay, etc differently converted versions, use masks on them, and so on. The problem is, those things need planning beforehand. You need to know what you want to do in order to even begin with. Not so in Lab. It's a very intuitive kind of working."
