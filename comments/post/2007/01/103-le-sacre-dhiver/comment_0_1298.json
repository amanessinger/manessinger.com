We remember the good and the beautiful, but more so we remember the cruel things that we've seen and that have happened to us. To some, never anything good has happened. Some of us can cope with these memories, some break, and if they do, all sorts of things can happen, even those that we would not want to believe possible. <br /><br />This is not an excuse. We all can make choices and we have to do so, but for some, making the right choices is incredibly much harder than for most of us. It is a strange world."
