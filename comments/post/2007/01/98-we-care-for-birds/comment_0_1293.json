Its facade is lit brightly green.<br /><br />@Thomas: Well, I guess the problem is, that politics today can't possibly be made with individuals in mind. When you make laws that affect millions of people, you can't expect not to hurt at least some. Whatever you do is doomed to be someone's nightmare, and I am sure the disattachment that we see in our politicians is in a way caused by that sad fact. It is our sheer numbers that makes them see us as numbers. <br /><br />That's one thing. The other is, that it is always safe for politicians to bash minorities."
