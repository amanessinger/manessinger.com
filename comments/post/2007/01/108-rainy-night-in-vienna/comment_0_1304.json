I saw the potential of the colors, but, even if I had been in it for the colors, it would have taken more time for studying the pattern of the changes than I had for all four or five shots.<br /><br />So, the whole image just happened and I was lucky. Only seeing the images at home gave me the realization, that the unbidden for image \"in the middle\", the accident, was better than the others. The others were framed the obvious way, the feet of a person on the left upper side, all the rest reflections of street lights and car lights on the wet pavement, making the whole very \"rule-of-thirds\". <br /><br />And then there was this one, with the bicyclist bold in the middle, merging with a second person. Not what I had envisioned, but much more mysterious.<br /><br />Thanks for your comments. You know what they mean to me."
