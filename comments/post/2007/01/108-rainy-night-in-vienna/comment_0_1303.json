And the shimmering wet platinums in the hilights are powerful counterpoints to the black blotches and golden glows that smear elegantly behind the shadows. You have created an impressionistic piece out of precisionism... My that is hard. And the tense left to right lines pull  me up and up to the headless figures. Night can be so mysterious, you've exploited that ther... but I return to the palette. It rocks.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing...<br /><br />Ted<br />http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br />http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker"
