    "content": "Great shot, Andreas.  Very well seen and executed.  The contrast between the completely realistic image of the bikes at the top of the frame and the abstraction in the rest of the frame is great.<br /><br />I know what you are saying about having wanted to take the photo in single shot mode, but the whole series from a high speed burst might look cool, too, as it could show the motion you described in a series of still frames.<br /><br />John"
