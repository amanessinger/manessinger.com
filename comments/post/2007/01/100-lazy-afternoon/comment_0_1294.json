    "content": "You are a pioneer in a new form of journaling. We both are. Until blogs anddigital photography, this was way beyond the possible. Plus the form demands that the words in any given day be few. We must find a point from that day, a thought to buff. And yes, a memory to sieze. It seems like such a natural extension of past journaling techniques that we overlook the astonishing step into new dimensions of self expression that we have been permitted as we poke our lenses into a technology which allows us to make the subliminal... absolute.. concrete. It is fascinating where you are going with this, and how the totality of this excercise becomes even greater than its parts. Much like stitching together a personal quilt of identity. Thanks for sharing."
