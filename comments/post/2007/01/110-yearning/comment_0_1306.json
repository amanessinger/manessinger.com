    "content": "It's as if each lens presents us with a differnetly rich menu of its faults... Faults as strengths. The aspherical abberations which dance at the limits of this depth of field are behond charming. The bars, like your grid in yesterday's posting, are imprisoning us from joinging into the frolicking gaeity  of some unknown whimsy... There are smiles on the other side of these bars, but we can only imagine them. <br />And again, i wonder at the way your eye is developing. The exercise has you growing like an Olympian on hormones. <br />Thanks for sharing,<br />Ted<br />http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br />http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker"
