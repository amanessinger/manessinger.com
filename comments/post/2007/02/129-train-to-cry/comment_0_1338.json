You did a great job merging and manipulating the multiple exposures to create something wonderful.<br/><br/>Of course, one can see an abstract association with train tracks here, and thus a link to the story of the day.  But the train I see in this image is a train of happiness--a train carrying excited passengers to see their loved ones: a train full of gaily wrapped packages; a train carrying goods to market; a train that opens new horizons; a train full of life.  <br/><br/>The train in this image is not the train of death from the story of the day...or is it?  Perhaps it is the train of death captured in the last moment of joy before the horror of the bombs began.  <br/><br/>And so we are left to ponder the eternal question--how can we as a species produce such beauty and such horror?  What is within us that allows some of us to look on the joy and hope of a train full of life and contemplate its destruction?  How can our species produce both the image of the day and the story of the day?"
