    "content": "Your image strikes a chord. A familar rythmic chord to which I can relate. <br/><br/>I love simplistic rythmic imagery and this one is first rate. Also, I respect your decision to not make this a multicolored image. Singular color schemes often work better for this kind of thing and I believe this image is an excellent case in point.<br/><br/>Bravo!<br/><br/>-Michael"
