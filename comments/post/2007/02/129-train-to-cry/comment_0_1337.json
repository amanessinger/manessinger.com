    "content": "Are you familiar with the work of Pierre Bonnard? He was an important influence upon Henri Cartier-Bresson. Critics have called his primary mood,that of elegy.One wrote that he was a painter of the disappearance of pleasure. <br/><br/>This is a very pleasurable image. The curves are sensual, the colors warm, even hot. Yet your interpretation of it is bitter. It's an interpretation which doesn't resonate with me. How odd, you sensed a mood at the moment of creation, but I received a very different one. I wonder about the disconnect. <br/><br/>Regardless, it's a powerful abstract image. I just don't see Pierre Bonnard in it. <br/><br/>Ted<br/>http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br/>http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker"
