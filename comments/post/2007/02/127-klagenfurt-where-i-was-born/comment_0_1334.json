So often we rigorously frame things so that the commonplace is excised. For the first time I am seeing how the pieces you see each day fit together. It is something I like yet, alas, I fail to do myself. Somehow the commonplace seems so banal to us, yet will seem almost exotic to others. <br/>And this image is anything but banal. I do wonder though why there is traffic only for a block around that turret in the distance. Is it because of the length of your late exposure? If so, what became of the headlight streaks? <br/>As for narrowing of minds that you decry in your daily story. It appears to me that culture swings in twenty/thirty year cycles. This rightward swing is nowhere near the evangelism of the Fifties and Thirties. Nor of the \"Victorian\" ages before. <br/>But each swing is uncomfortable to a significant part of our populations. Each carries pain for folks who are swatted by the wrecking ball of the dialectic. <br/>Thanks for sharing,<br/>Ted<br/><br/>http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br/>http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker/"
