    "content": "The colors are so damned evocative of Disney. I feel a smile coming on and expect to hear elves or dwarfs singing and dancing off stage right. I can't consider anything this joyfully lit to be sinister or bloody. Nope, more gleeful and warm. It makes me yearn for Jiminney Cricketd, or Tinker Bell. And the motion blur in the background reinforces the suggestion of dancing impliments. I know... Beauty And The Beast, right? Yesssss.... This lead thing has a French accent and sings about castle living. <br/>Oh BTW... technical stuff... dead on... composition... deader on. <br/><br/>Ted"
