    "content": "Alice does not sing opera and Franco Brusatti, well, incidentally he has composed even an opera and some sacred music, I think, but on this album it's simply Italian pop music. Click the Amazon link, there you can at least hear some very short samples of all the songs.<br/><br/>I am not surprised that iTunes does not have it. I am even amazed that Amazon has it. I got mine as a present from Italy after having hunted for years for a CD to replace my old vinyl record.<br/><br/>Guarantee? In matters of taste? You're kidding, aye? I like it, I know some people who know it and know nobody who does not like it. That's about as close to a guarantee as it gets ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Andreas"
