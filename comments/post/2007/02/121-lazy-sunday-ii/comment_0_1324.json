    "content": "There are words that men have difficulty using in English. One of them is \"sweet\". It is understood to be some sort of code for gender, um, confusion. And yet, without any  pjorative overtones, this is a sweet image. I've found high key difficult to manipulate around the frame... or maybe I find it hard to manipulate my way around a high key frame... wuddever. <br/>This image revels in high key, revealing a light place almost devoid of texture. A place where friction probably doesn't occur. Where there's litte residue of tension in the culture. I like that place. It's sweet.<br/><br/>Ted<br/>http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br/>http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker"
