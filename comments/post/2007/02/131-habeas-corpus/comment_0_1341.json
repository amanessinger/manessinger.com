    "content": "Okay... this is the third time I've returned to this image. There are, for your photography, two unusual items here. First you have a human being present... or at least part of one. And secondly the soft fattness of the hand interworking with the hard precision of the stone and iron.<br/>I like it that you frequently dabble in the surreal - in full color. You do not hide behind an \"artsy\" veil of monocrhome to play with ideas that flitter just beyond the grasp of a picture's frames. <br/>This capture reminds us that there is a world in the gutters between pictures. In fact all but the tiny snatch you display exists there. I like it that I wonder who owns this disembodied hand. I like it that I wonder why it is so strangely posing. I like it that it is lit very much like a dead fish - or an almost-corpse. <br/>I like it that I wonder. We don't do that enough.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing,<br/>Ted<br/>http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br/>http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker/"
