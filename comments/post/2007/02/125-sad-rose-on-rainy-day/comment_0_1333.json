In the meantime I have mounted one of them at my workplace. I LOVE daylight lamps.<br/><br/>Yesterday I didn't want to unmount this particular lamp, thus I used only one of those lamps. The other light was the normal kitchen light. Two lights, one blue, one yellow, and that on a white rose. I swear, there is no way to get a satisfying white balance. When the tips of the petals are like you want them, then the shadows are sickly yellow.<br/><br/>This is the story of monochrome, that's for artistic concepts ðŸ™‚"
