    "content": "Okay... like the image... but... like the thoughts more. Now... why not an image that speaks the thoughts? Why not an image that pours commercial logos over kids watching sports? A square peg/round hole marked by competitive machinery? Why not a plug that won't fit a socket? Why not a sign that points in the wrong direction? You have the eye. You have the craft... You have the ideas... Um... time to  make a stew... <br /><br />But.. I still like this image, regardless of my hissy fit.... Especially since the message on the signs is clear to me as... as.. a window painted black. I'm not even certain what the language is... much less its message.AAARGH!!!<br /><br />Thanks for sharing... <br /><br />Ted<br />http://imagefiction.blogspot.com<br />http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker"
