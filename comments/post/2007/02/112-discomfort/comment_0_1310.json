    "content": "Must be a loose association of mine. I've asked only one other person and she doesn't share it either. She said, she wouldn't fear the rails, she would fear the gate. You know, this predominant image of Auschwitz, the gate with the label \"Arbeit macht frei\" on top. Funnily enough, it was exactly this image that I associated in the first place, only not the gate but the rails that run through it.<br /><br />Well, if I had the intention to express my association, then it is certainly a weakness. Did I? Not exactly. I was not even sure if I should impart my feelings about the image at all. But having done so, probably makes me guilty ðŸ™‚<br /><br />Glad you like it. As an image I like it as well. At least much better than my two night shots."
