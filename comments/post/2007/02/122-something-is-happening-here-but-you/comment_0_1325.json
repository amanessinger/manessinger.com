I'm not sure if this reaction is a result of the title/image or if its more a function of the image itself. And I guess once an image is titled it shouldn't matter. Nevertheless, these are the words that sprang forth.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the lensbaby effects. I like the control you can impart over the focal points within an image. I don't own a proper one, but have used home-made models that give the same kinds of control. (In this image I especailly like the way the focal point of the pavers seems to swirl like a whirlpool.)<br/><br/>Great work. And yes, a very depressing story of the day.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>-Michael"
