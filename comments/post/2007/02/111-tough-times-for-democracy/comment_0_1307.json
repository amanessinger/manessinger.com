America needs voting machines so that the television networks can call the winners early enough for the East Coast to go to bed by eleven o'clock. That way they can get the most ads in, and have an election mimic a scripted reality show. <br /><br />You guys in Europed don't understand our elections, they are not about politics, ideology or governance... they are about entertainment. <br /><br />Ted"
