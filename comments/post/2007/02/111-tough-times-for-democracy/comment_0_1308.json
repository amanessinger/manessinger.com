Sure, that makes any manual counting impossible, at least if we consider television.<br /><br />I mean, it's not very different here in Austria. It is the all-important thing to make it for the 7:30pm news.<br /><br />I read an interesting proposal in a discussion on a computer news site. Basically they proposed a voting machine that would print your vote.   You would then put the printout into an envelope and put that into the ballot box. The manual counting of the printouts would provide the actual reference result.<br /><br />This way you could have it all: the instant result from the machine, the insurance of having cast the intended vote for the voter, the repeatability in case of doubt, anonymity, everything. There wouldn't even be any incentive to hack a voting machine. Why should one? The next voter would recognize it anyway. <br /><br />It only costs a tad more, because you have to pay for the machines and the personnel.<br /><br />OK, it's not a tad, it is a lot, but, as I said, it's for Democracy after all!"
