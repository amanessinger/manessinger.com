I wish after your LAB adjustments you had returned to an RGB color space and utilizing a curves adjustment layer, cranked up the mid tones. Then, cranked up the darkness. Then cranked up the highlights. Then... utilizing the mask on the adjustment layer... painted back in any blown out highlights. The colors you've found are muffled on my monitor and I'd like to hear them sing.<br/><br/>But... for what it's worth... I like the design, the shapes, the lava-like flow of color. They have almost become your signature."
