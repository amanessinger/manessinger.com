    "content": "Look at the respect the people who live in this place have for themselves, and the way they want others to see them. Then look at the disrespect this graffer has for these people and what their self respect means to him. The graf has a grace yet the asymmetry of its placement has to be especially deliberate. It was drawn prettily yet placed ugly. <br/><br/>The graffer respects himself... flaunts himself. Flaunts his control to deface and his knowledge of how to do particulalry nasty visual violence. Some would call him sad. But sad is what he is making the sort of people who live inside of this place. Some will find a pop or politico psych way to diagnose this graffer as a victim of something or other, driven to express his rage... Instead it is everyone who sees this who becomes his victim. <br/><br/>Well caught Andreas. Your commentary is shrill, but appropriate.<br/><br/>Ted<br/><br/><a HREF=\"http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">My Images Explained</a><br/><a HREF=\"http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker/\" REL=\"nofollow\">My Images Stored</a>"
