But today as it came up on my monitor I was listening to Rufus Wainwright's Chocolate and Cigarettes and I don't just like the image now, it's so much beyond that.  Don't know how or why the song together with the image had such an impact on me but it all came together so perfectly. Music is so effective in motion pictures, I guess it shouldn't come as any surprise that it can be just as effective with still photography.  Gives me a new appreciation for your song of the day approach to photoblogging.  <br/>Keep 'em coming, I really enjoy your work."
