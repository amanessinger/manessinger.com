    "content": "Splendid image. The color and composition work well together, that's for sure. There is a warm an inviting feel to the whole piece... warm stones, warm blue doors, and a nicely mottled array of brickwork (love that brickwork). If there was one wish it would be that the keystone to the arch were presented in its entirety with a bit of space above, but its such a small matter... I almost didn't mention it.<br/><br/>And as to the lens. It seems these \"superzooms\" of today can do a fine job of covering most things quite well. Certainly more practical when travelling than a case full of primes (of which I am fond). I keep telling myself that it might be worth my while to seek one out. Perhaps one day."
