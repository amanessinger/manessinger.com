Take an umbrella and make an image of the neon lights reflecting in the puddles. <br/><br/>Smog and heavy industry? Wow, that will color your sundowns and make interesting silhouettes.<br/><br/>Shops, shops and parking cars, nothing else? Pick a shiny car and see how the colors of the shops get reflected, see how distorted the reflections are!<br/><br/>Run-down industrial area? Good. Rusty metal is better than shiny, peeling color is attractive and makes interesting patterns. Go near and watch out for the lone flower!<br/><br/>Look for patterns of light and shadow. Make a habit of taking pictures in the morning and in the late afternoon, because strong sidelight makes fantastic patterns of light and shadow.<br/><br/>Look for color, especially isolated patches of color within areas of opposing colors. Accents of red within green, yellow/orange within blue, etc. It does not matter what the colored object is. Color alone is a reason to take an image.<br/><br/>Forget the notion of \"motif\". Everything is a motif when you decide it is. The subject of your image is what you make subject of your image. If it's an attractive piece of dung and somebody disagrees, so what? It's your image, you are the ultimate judge, nobody else can be.<br/><br/>Andreas"
