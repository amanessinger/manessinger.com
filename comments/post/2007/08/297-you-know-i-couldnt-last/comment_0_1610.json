It belongs, not in a grungy little hallway, but in a grand home all polished and shiny.  And that in-your-face splash of yellow against the subdued dirty-white woodwork is also a contradiction.  Then there's that litttle patch of colour around the door knob which adds anothe focal point. So much too look at. I could really get lost in there.<br/>Great post."
