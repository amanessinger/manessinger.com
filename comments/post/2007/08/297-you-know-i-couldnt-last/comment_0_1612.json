Inviting colors, a well-worn look - provokes kind of cozy feelings for me.<br/><br/>@Ted: If your questions were serious: I wouldn't be overly worried. It seems a global thing, that pocket thiefs and such are massing in places were tourists usually go when doing sightseeing Also in the US I suppose, I don't think it's a European phenomenon. <br/><br/>So, yes, I would take a reasonable amount of care, especially in Italy - But otherwise, just enjoy the city and photographing it."
