    "content": "I'm planning to visit Rome and Florence in October but we've been warned about muggers and pick pockets. In fact it's a warning that covers much of Europe. And I've noted that your captures and those of many others commonly find that grafitti defaces the pride of so many places, even residences. In fact I'm told to never wear my wallet in my back pocket as is common here in the US, but maybe to even buy a pocketed belt to be warn under my clothes!!<br/><br/>None of these things are normal in this country. Oh there are neigborhoods in many cities where one must be very cautious, but people rarely feel like prey for robbers in broad daylight in well travelled spots. <br/><br/>You so ordinarily find that graffs are part of your compositional statements that I wonder if you have theories. I too have done graffs, but they are found in obscure places and they are so unusual that they become the subject of my pictures as opposed to ornaments. <br/><br/>What do you think is  happening here? Should we be concerned for our safety in Rome? Friends recently returned from London to tell tales of having been mugged, others from Madrid had their purses picked. Is it our naive trust in our public safety that results from the confidence we have on our streets and in our homes a contributing cause? <br/><br/>I look at the slashed \"lost\" on this wall contrasted against the faded grandeur of the doors and wonder... wonder... wonder... Other firends come back from Rome with pictures of beggars on every corner. It seems odd. I know that many in Europe find America to be an insensitive place and we are so often lectured about our decadence and bad manners... yet in the homes of Western civilization throughout Europe there seem to be many signs of rents in the social safety net. How concerned should we be?"
