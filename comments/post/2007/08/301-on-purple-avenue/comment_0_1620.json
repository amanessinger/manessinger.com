    "content": "Are these leaves or seed pods? I know I have envied your early Austrian spring, but does that mean a consequently early autumn? <br/><br/>There is something so melancholy about fallen leaves and gutters. Each evoke an ending, and the colors seem to just slightly reinforce that ... as if you are telling us... \"It's coming... not just now... but... wait... wait...\"<br/><br/>The poetry of this piece rocks Andreas. It is vibrant but with the tiniest tear in the poets eye."
