That's for inspiration ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Regarding the climbers, well, I don't have any, but it sounds positively interesting. I guess one would climb up and the other down, a bit like Spiderman, right?<br/><br/>On the other hand, composition is nothing that interests me at the moment. It's not a principal reservation against it (what regards \"photographic truth\", I'm much more on Ted Byrne's side than on Paul Maxim's, though I value both of them), I know it would open up another dimension, but I don't feel I need it at the moment. I have still so many things to explore (as you see, wide-angle macro is my pet occupation now), and I don't work commercially. If I did, of course I'd exploit every possibility to get where I need faster, composition being one way towards that end. And, to be honest, I have no practice at all in that discipline, I guess I couldn't even do it convincingly.<br/><br/>Thanks again, good to see you here<br/><br/>Andreas"
