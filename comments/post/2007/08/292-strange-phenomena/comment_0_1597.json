I love reflected light so the quality of light really gets my attention and then all of the shapes and colors help to hold it. Because the set up is surreal when I was looking at this image I started to imagine a composite where you would have two rock climbers...one appearing to scale the tilted parking lot and the other scaling the wall above the mystery reflections....thanks for being here everyday Andreas...its an inspiration!!!!....Craig"
