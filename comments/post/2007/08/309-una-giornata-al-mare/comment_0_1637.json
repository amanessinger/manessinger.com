Sometimes it is unavoidable, sometimes it just happens, and in those places it is certainly harder to get at unseen views than anywhere else. I wouldn't care. Most people are afraid of converging lines and non-level horizons, that would eliminate 90% anyway ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Sorry, I have no remedy. Just go and shoot and be happy shooting. I'm confident you'll manage to be recognizable anyway. You always manage to be.<br/><br/>Andreas"
