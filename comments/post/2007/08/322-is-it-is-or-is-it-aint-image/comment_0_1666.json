    "content": "This is absolutely one of your images. You have a style which is ideosyncratic. Your color palette, eye for shape and form are particularly unique. And the imprint of your determinedly NOT rule-of-threes composition is the final device which imprints your brand upon your offerings. But more importantly they all package ideas that let us look through the image to a compelling back-story of emotion, thought, or both. <br/><br/>Now not every image carries all of that to the same degree of course. But it's my guess that your audience wold rank images differently since each of us brings different settings to your table. This image pours a lot of that water into its bucket. And while I'm having a llttle trouble finding the window in it which passes me into its back-story of imagining - I know I'll find it. And that puzzle is why I keep coming back. <br/><br/>On the other hand... what do I know? Eh? Thanks as usual for sharing....<br/><br/>Ted"
