Oh, that's an easy one: Because you publish beautiful pictures on your site.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Sorry, couldn't resist... ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Honestly, I think one of the major things that draws me back to your site is that you have your own, very distinct style of seeing and picturing things. I tremendously enjoy seeing everyday things with a fresh eye. Of course, your high level of technical quality also helps.<br/><br/>And following that train of thoughts, I agree with Ted. The picture certainly is one of yours, especially light-wise. The perspective is a bit more normal than in a lot of other shots though. \"Normal\" in the sense of \"Has been pictured before\".<br/><br/>From those pictures that you mentioned in your post, No. 316 is my clear favorite.<br/><br/>Keep 'em coming...! ðŸ™‚"
