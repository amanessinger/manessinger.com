Those two front pieces have a third dimension feel about them, almost 3D, and the DOF seems to decrease in discreet steps with each row of chess pieces until we reach the background.  I believe Ted has called you a control freak (only in the most complimentary manner of course) and this is a fine example of that aspect of your work.  Really enjoyed this one Andreas."
