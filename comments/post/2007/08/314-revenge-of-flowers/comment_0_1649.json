That's a really a LOT of colors - mabe a bit more than I can actually cope with. However, I certainly enjoy the graphical contrasts in the picture (in terms of square, static frame vs. the flowerish window grill). You certainly made great use of the grafiti. Ah, c'mon, admit it - you sprayed it there by yourself... Just for the shot."
