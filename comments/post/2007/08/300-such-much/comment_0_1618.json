I've had some days when I was late, even two or three days at times, but in such cases I have caught up later with two, three or four images at one day. <br/><br/>Mostly the problem was not that I had no image for that particular day, but that I had been late post-processing them and writing the blog entries.<br/><br/>And ... hmm ... yes, the 300 was a 30. In Vienna I am living in KaiserstraÃŸe 30, and in the garden there is a shed with the #30 on it. I took the liberty to give it a boost by a magnitude ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>And ... no, I guess I could still learn a trick or two from Ted ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Thanks for your support, after all: it is that feeling why we're doing it, right?<br/><br/>Andreas"
