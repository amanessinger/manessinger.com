Foolish because she apparently listened to and agreed with the U.S. position (through Sec. of State Rice) that she could safely return to Pakistan and help restore democracy.  That was - and remains - utter nonsense.  I would very much like to know what the Bush administration promised her and how they intended to protect her.  The whole ugly affair makes no sense to me on the surface.  But then little of the foreign policy practiced by my government over the last 7 years does.<br/><br/>On a more philosophical note, I will never understand how any person can justify sacrificing their own existence for some nebulous ideology.  Regardless of your religious beliefs, death is, physically at least, extremely \"final\".  Your day in the sun is over.<br/><br/>Perhaps Mrs. Bhutto is a martyr.  I don't know.  But as Ted said, the outcome of this adventure was predictable.  If she was as politically astute as some claim, then she died - for what?"
