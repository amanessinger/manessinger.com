    "content": "Paul, what a pleasure to see you here!<br/><br/>So what now? Martyr or fool? Underdeveloped fear, overdeveloped greed for power, loss of reality or too much trust in the US government?<br/><br/>We can't tell, but whatever the matter, the question remains, what can someone do, who wants to work towards democracy in an environment that's not democratic at all? Accept that it won't work and do nothing? Accept that democracy is something for those who have it? That seems a tad thin to me.<br/><br/>I don't know if democracy was the ideal of Mrs Bhutto, but lacking better knowledge, I am willing to assume it. And if so, I guess there is hardly anything one can do but risk one's life. Democracy is nothing that simply springs to existence. It must be fought for and, once you have it, looked after.<br/><br/>I am afraid that we already have seen the summit of democratic freedom. There may be many good reasons why someone can't embrace the democratic left, but even if so, I think it is a deadly sin to accept the erosion of constitutional rights that is currently on the agenda of our ruling classes. Maybe we are not so far from a situation, where acting on behalf of democracy  will be dangerous again, even in our beloved and still so peaceful western world. And then the problems of a Mrs Bhutto may be our problems again, probably sooner than we think.<br/><br/>Andreas"
