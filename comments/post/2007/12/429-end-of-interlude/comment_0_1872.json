I tried it, got 21000K and it looked completely uninteresting, just like on an afternoon with particularly bad weather ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>No, actually the look comes from two things. <br/><br/>First: I shot sometime in civil twilight at a cloudy day. That's the gloom.<br/><br/>Second: I deliberately let the white balance drift off to the cool side. I think yellow/blue is always a good thing, even if it is so asymmetric as here.<br/><br/>What certainly makes a difference, is the fact that we are surrounded by mountains, which in winter makes for long periods of fog and for static pools of cold air. Do you have fog in winter?"
