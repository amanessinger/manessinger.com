    "content": "We have no culture of assimilation any more. We had, because most people in Vienna have roots in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia or Poland, but that was in times of the old Empire.<br/><br/>Then there was a wave of immigrants from Hungary after their failed revolution in 1956, and that is mostly the end of the story.<br/><br/>In recent history many people went through Austria to other countries, for example the US or Israel (particularly the russian Jews), and of course there are the immigrants from former Yugoslavia and Turkey that we ourselves recruited in the 1960s/70s.<br/><br/>The latter were never really welcome. When having a job was never a given thing any more, Austrians would have liked to see them going back, but the opposite happened. Many of those workers had become citizens, some of their families followed, they had children who were raised as Austrians, and in a more open culture that would have been a story of success. Not so here. The majority simply ignored those things and finally woke up to xenophobia, when the numbers were not to ignore any more.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Austrian society being as it is, did not encourage immigrants to assimilate, and so they frequently didn't, making them stand out even more, fueling fears again, and so it is a self-perpetuing phenomenon. Pretty hard to get out of that viscious circle, especially when nobody seems to want to."
