    "content": "In spite of America's racial history, or maybe because of it, we are preoccupied with our diversity. And it is essential. Unlike European nations where the very concept of nationality starts with race, ours is spectacularly different. <br/><br/>While we constantly struggle with integration, its an integration of cultures as well as of physical characteristics. The entire concept of America is propelled by an idea of absorption. It is both a strength and a weakness. A source of tension and comfort. <br/><br/>Just now we are confronting the arrival of a significant Hispanic culture. But the Hispanics share the same western Judeo Christian.... Greco Roman... European roots which has shaped the majority culture. But even the small differences between the Hispanic and dominant American culture are causing tension between both parties. However it's a tension that we've worked through dozens of times and will be overcome again.<br/><br/>I'm frankly more fascinated by how the largely racially defined cultures of Europe are reacting to the much more distinct cultures that are arriving from Muslim and cultures and even more ancient cultures from Africa. I'm guessing that the cultural tensions will be more resistant there than here where we have a culture born from (imperfect) assimilation."
