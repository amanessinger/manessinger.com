(I was going to try and qualify this with some sort of abstract statement about \"artistic honesty\" or some such baloney, but such qualifications are ultimately so hollow in their ability to cover every scenario that I decided against it.) The bottom line is up to the viewer anyway. We can lead and coax with color, line, sharpness--everything in the toolbox--and it's still up the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions.<br/><br/>I like your test. The image made me feel excited, nervous, and even a little scared. The colors are vivid and wild, like those you might find after sundown in a district you are better off visiting with a friend. Indeed, your whole treatment of the image led me down that path. Was this what you intended? Does it really matter?<br/><br/>I think about these things sometimes when I create images, if for no other reason than because I will be a viewer, too. So it starts with my vision, even if it doesn't get developed until after I take the shot. <br/><br/>In other words, my snapshots are still snapshots until I do something more with them. After that, its up to the viewer."
