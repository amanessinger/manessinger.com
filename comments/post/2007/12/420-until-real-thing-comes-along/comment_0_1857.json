The warm reds and oranges give way to the cool blue towards the shower.  <br/><br/>I don't worry about post-processing.  I bought my first camera in 1983, long before I first tried PhotoShop in 1990.  It was easy to see the two coming together.  <br/><br/>At that time, there was a lot of talk about \"authentic\" photographs.  But I was young and of the mind that PhotoShop was a perfectly acceptable tool to refine (or even create) a vision.<br/><br/>I still take photographs and I still use PhotoShop.  I'm happy that so many photographers now post-process their work.  <br/><br/>Once upon a time, there were bands who refused to use synthesizers because the sound \"wasn't real.\"<br/><br/>And before that, there were artists who refused to recognize photography.<br/><br/>Times change.  Art changes.  And photography, one art, has never been better -- just like music.  Both have benefited from technology, when well-applied."
