    "content": "Thanks. This image only lives through post-processing. When I stood on the street it was dark and cold. I was in a hurry, and thus the image was unbalanced. There was nothing on the right side to balance the hanging house, and the whole right half was way too dark in comparison. <br/><br/>I solved this problem with a partial lens blur over some bluish lights that shone through the trees. In the original they were distractions and took away from the mood, but as circles of confusion (though their existence would be against the laws of physics) they contribute to the atmosphere and are bright enough to give the balance that I wanted. <br/><br/>And then there was color. I made a combination of two versions, one very cold, colder as seemed correct, one much warmer. Then I took the image to Lab mode (without merging the layers) and blended the warm version in where the cool one was distinctly yellow. Do you notice the white around the windows? You can't photograph that, you must fake it, but it does sure look good ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Andreas"
