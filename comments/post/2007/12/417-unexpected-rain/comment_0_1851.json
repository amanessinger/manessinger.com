I haven't read anything about your technique today, preferring to remove my gear head hat and rather to enjoy how you are making the machine that separates you from the image become seemingly invisible. <br/><br/>When all is done, what we do is more about archers than arrows. This is superb capture which only a superb archer could bag.<br/><br/>I like everything about it. Tell me more about how it makes you feel. And how you wanted me to feel... us to feel... as you created it through first click to final sweep of pixels.I'm growing more interested in why you did, than how. I can do most of the how... but not most of the why.<br/><br/>Ted"
