    "content": "I'll be back to art today. This writing about my new camera was an idea to attract visitors. I own something, that many paople want to know about. I do so, along with maybe 100.000 others, but most people don't write about it, so I guessed I have information attractive for a much broader public than the one that I usually attract. Well, I was right. Yesterday I had 100 unique visitors in one day. OK, it's not the 30.000 that The Online Photographer attracts in a good day, but for me it was an absolute high.<br/><br/>I shall come back to the D300 once or twice the next week, but that will be it. It's a wonderful piece of engineering and certainly the most capable camera that I've ever had, but it's still only a camera.<br/><br/>This image? It's a little bit like the archetypical cowboy riding into the sundown, the end of a story. We can't say which story and if it's a happy end, but from the way he holds his hand, I suppose it can't have been that bad ðŸ™‚"
