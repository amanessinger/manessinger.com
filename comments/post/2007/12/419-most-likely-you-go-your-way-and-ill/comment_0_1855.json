    "content": "That's one of the things that infuriate me, when I read Alain Briot's article: the insinuation that a style is only a style when it is visible in each and every image. That's utter rubbish. It's elitist snobbish myth, and in all that snobbism it does nothing but strengthen the position of the art trade, at the prize of weakening the artist's."
