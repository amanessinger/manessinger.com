    "content": "I've not been paying enough attention to trains. In Italy I noticed how frantic, how energetic, how popular the trains are. In this country we made a decision back in the 50s to subsidize the highways to the expense of the rail beds. It was irrational in the sense that after water, the most inexpensive way to move a ton of anything is by rail. However this is a BIG place and the trade of went to opening it up ... which is a lot more efficient with roads. <br/><br/>Pity we couldn't do both, and in a world of increasingly scarce (read more expensive) energy, I'm guessing that there will be a re-interest in the rails hereabouts. However, in the interim we are way behind in rail technology and consequently I've not paid sufficient attention to the things. <br/><br/>This image reminds me of rail potential, both economically and photographically. After the holidays Rocco and I have to go out and walk some steel."
