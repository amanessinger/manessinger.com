It is as if it tumbled into the Twilight Zone!! <br/><br/>Andreas, your wonderful work and support have been important to me this year. Photography is where I go to escape the rigors of what I do at the day job. In a sense it is a therapy as well as a performance art. The ideas you share in your images have lent me ideas upon which to meditate and strengthen the relaxation which this field provides. Thanks my friend, I wish you and yours a merry and happy... <br/><br/>Ted"
