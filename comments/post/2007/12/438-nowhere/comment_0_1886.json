Being the culprit for the tilt in some of your images makes me proud and, with you being the Artist that you are, I deem it quite an achievement ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>In fact I have profited much more from our relationship than you could even have. Your strict refusal of any doctrine, your judgment that is focused on nothing but the result, all that has been immensely liberating to me and my art, and consequently I have to thank you.<br/><br/>Regarding the Twilight Zone, well, the time that you see is that of the date that I've posted the entry, and in this case the 25th was posted shortly after midnight, but I admit I was confused as well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Thanks again<br/><br/>Andreas"
