The sky was much too yellow - probably this is what Dylan meant with \"The sun's not yellow it's chicken\" ðŸ™‚ - and I have taken away color until it looked more real. <br/><br/>You see, this is very late, about fifteen minutes after the sun had vanished behind the mountains. The sky is much more dramatic than it was in reality, but I guess especially the green is not too much off.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the remnants of light should definitely glow much more. All in all I am not too glad about this image.<br/><br/>Andreas"
