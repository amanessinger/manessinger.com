I have criticized the halo that he produced when darkening the sky, and that's why:<br/><br/>It may well be that there was a halo in the original exposure, but the halo has long since been so tightly associated with sloppy editing, that I would do everything to get rid of it, even if it was there in the first place.<br/><br/>The problem is, that people only see the result, and they don't care if there was a halo originally, they will always blame it to you.<br/><br/>At least that's what I think<br/><br/>Andreas"
