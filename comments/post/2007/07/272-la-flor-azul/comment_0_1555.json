    "content": "Yes, this is a hibiscus, rose mallow or marsh mallow. A very lovely flower, that pale lilac hue. The shadow doesn't bother me at all - it adds interest.<br/><br/>BTW, okra is also a mallow - Hibiscus esculentus. It has lovely white flowers with dark maroonish-red on the petals at their bases around the pistil/stamen area.<br/><br/>The brilliant red hibiscus is Hawaii's state flower.<br/><br/>And I do believe that hollyhocks are also hibiscus. I used to \"breed\" my own when I was a teen. I'd select flowers of certain colors and polinate them with flowers of another color, then put a bag over the flower to prevent further polination by bees.<br/><br/>I even developed double flowers long before they hit the market as something new.<br/><br/>Then I'd collect the seeds and carefully label and store them until planting time the following spring. It was lots of fun.<br/><br/>Flo"
