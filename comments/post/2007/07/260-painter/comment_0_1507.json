It's a funny thing shooting primes. They challenge your creativity, and the Sigma 30/1.4 is probably best in that discipline. It's the frame of a normal lens on my Nikon, but with the perspective of a wide-angle, and you can make nice things with the 1.4 aperture. I love this lens.<br/><br/>Andreas"
