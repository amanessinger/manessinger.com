    "content": "It took me a while. There was an evocative quality I thought to these colors which teased at my memory banks. Have you ever sniffed at a vague scent that abruptly wafts by and felt yourself abruptly transported back into memory? <br/><br/>Well these colors were wafting and they were tugging me somewhere and then... BAM! It was maybe thirty years ago and I'd takne my first FujiChrome slides along Massachusetts' South Shore. I'd pulled them from the mail and as I plucked each from their little green box I saw fine boats rocking at their berths all bathed in what seems to have been just exactly those hues. <br/><br/>And it was the glow of your image which melded my boats with these boats decades and thousands of miles apart into a common warm synthesis. And as I write this, I seem to hear the water lapping and smell the salt... and feel the evening breeze of a memory place and time that were romantically Fuji-clad in the sunset."
