    "content": "Holy Moley! This is your best abstract in months. And given the quality of those others... that is saying a lot!<br/><br/>Okay... the BAZZZZZZ of bursting light points in the upper left... like neon corn kernels dancing around in superheated oil just before exploding are... all by themselves a primary plane of interest. But the discipline you've shown here to corral them into just, what? Twenty percent of the surface area is awesome. And then the dazzling green tubes of direction which take me by the eyelashes onto a chute that SPAAAAATS them into the oil!!!<br/><br/>But you have reserved your one touch of razor focus for the entry to the green/blue chute... The tack detailed line at mid-image right is like the archway to the entrance of a roller coaster ride. \"GET ON HERE!\" it screams barker-like. <br/><br/>And yet, much as I'm excited by all of the devices at play so far... there's that one blue/white  light in a sea of conservative murk, echoed by an almost accidental satellite in orange which distracts me from wallowing in the corn kernel bursts and insists that I come back to the start where again and again and again I zoom down along the green/blue pipelines. <br/><br/>This thing ROCKS!"
