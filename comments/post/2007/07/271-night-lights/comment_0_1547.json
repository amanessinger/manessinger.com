    "content": "I quite agree with Ted on this one. Very nice image indeed. It got tons of motion, first one way, then back again. Then back, and forth, back and forth. Really cool effect. And the bokeh is outstanding. <br/><br/>I actually owned a sigma 20mm f1.8 once. Although at the time I was not interested in the least with shallow DOF photography... I bought the lens strictly for the wide aspect, limited though it was in that regard. Mine was used on the Sigma SD9, which I owned for a time, and it gathered me a few nice images before I found I could get the same width with a lot less glass using a 24mm and an old WA extension lens. <br/><br/>It's a nice lens, but at the time I found it was just too large and cumbersome to tote around. Perhaps if I used it more creatively at f1.8...."
