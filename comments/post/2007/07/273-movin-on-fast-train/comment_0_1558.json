He has chosen to moderate comments, and in my eyes that's even less satisfying for the visitor, not to speak of the additional work for him. It's still a good idea to pay him a visit though. There are really some gems to be seen.<br/><br/>So, sorry for the verification, but our friends the spammers let me no choice. I wouldn't like links to porn sites appear on my pages. Or maybe to sites that show you something harmless, while infecting your computer with a virus or trojan.<br/><br/>I think that these verification \"words\" have a short lifetime, so when it takes you long to compose your comment or you take a break in between, verification would fail and you'd have to enter the next code given.<br/><br/>Andreas"
