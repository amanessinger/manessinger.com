I too thought the car looked like it was going to crash into you, but on closer look, I can see that it isn't, lol. I love the diagonals in this and the night lights and shadows. Excellent image 🙂<br/><br/>Flo - BTW, what's with this \"word verification\" gizmo? Sometimes it makes me type in 2nd word, even tho I thought I'd typed the first one perfectly. It's annoying. 😏"
