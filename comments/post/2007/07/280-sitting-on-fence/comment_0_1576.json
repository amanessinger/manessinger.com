Once again you've captured a great image here, probably my favourite of this series. There is one minor thing though that's bothering me.  I'm not sure about the bottom right corner where the high contrast and in focus section of the fence detracts from the main subject.  It does help to add balance to the image but maybe to the point of dominating it.  I don't know, but just wonder about your thought process here.<br/>All that aside, I really do like this image.  Keep 'em coming."
