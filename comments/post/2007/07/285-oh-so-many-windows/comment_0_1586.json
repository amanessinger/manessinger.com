I really like the repetition,  muted colours and curved lines of the windows. <br/><br/>How about \"Inside-Looking Out\" from The Animals, Retrospective album (http://www.amazon.com/Retrospective-Animals/dp/B0002IQABI) for a song of the day.  Makes me think of the unseen people on the other side of all those windows."
