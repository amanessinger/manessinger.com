This allows us to tolerate higher temperatures before turning on an air conditioner.<br/><br/>I love everything about the image - excep the tilt. Perhaps because I expect to see the car and cyclist come sliding \"down\" to the bright side any minute. Or maybe the tilt is too extreme for my tastes. Sorry. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Flo from the RV"
