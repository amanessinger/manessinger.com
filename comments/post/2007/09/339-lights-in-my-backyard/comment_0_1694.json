And they will seemingly become portals of light as if the shimmering were windows atop our tables, on our walls, on furniture, in dark hallways. And they will gather their power from the air, just as we gather some of ours from Wi-Fi waves that bathe us. And we won't even wonder at their existence, or how they work, or the fact that we have the ability to walk about, casually placing anywhere - the sun itself. <br/><br/>Until then, Van Gough lovers will love the way you've found his mad-man swirls in a door's window."
