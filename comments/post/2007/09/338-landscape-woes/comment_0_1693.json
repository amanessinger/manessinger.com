    "content": "Andreas,<br/><br/>I didn't refer to the image either. It's that I think, that to exaggerate, we need to have a reference point, but so far I have found none. Reality? Well, your's or mine? We take our surroundings in with all our senses, but all of us have to omit part of it. It would be overwhelming otherwise. The simple fact that I can come up with a new image every day, most of them shot in places where I've been a thousand times, proves that there is more to \"reality\" than we can ever digest.<br/><br/>It's not that by failure we don't see things \"as they are\", it's that we choose so, and different people make different choices, heck, even the same person makes different choices at different times. There may well be a \"reality\", but when it is different for all of us, when it changes guises for ourselves, what sense does it make to refer to this fleeting concept?<br/><br/>It's the term \"exaggeration\" that I objected to. Not because I felt attacked, no, only because I think it is not rooted anywhere. No reference point, no exaggeration. We could speak about the concept of otherness probably.<br/><br/>Anyway. Thanks for your interest ðŸ™‚"
