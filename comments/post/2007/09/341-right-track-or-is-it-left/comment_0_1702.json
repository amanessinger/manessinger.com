    "content": "The virtual compression of a long lens is so often forgotten by its owner. Telephotos too frequently substitute for shoes... for walking... for getting near-enough. Other times they are merely used to dip into spots where we cannot and to scoop out an otherwise unattainable image (bird-in-tree). <br/><br/>So it's particularly interesting to see the way that you've taken advantage of your longer lens to make the near seem as far as the far is (if you get my point). A shorter lens would have not allowed you to make that graceful curve a part of that imposing city-set no matter where you stood. And it positively would have denied you this composition which is, of course, what makes this capture so haunting. <br/><br/>This is a journeyman's mastery of tools to punch through craft into art. I wonder, would you have been as able to easily do this a year or so back before you imposed a daily discipline upon yourself re making postable images? <br/><br/>As usual... thanks for sharing Andreas..."
