The door does look bit contorted and unnatural, like it was shot with a wide angle, or even fisheye lens. I'm undecided on whether I think its distracting or actually adds to the visual interest. The backup photo looks great too.<br/><br/>Also, your comments about selective color enhancements were interesting. I thought I was the only one who bothered with that! I use an application called Color Mechanic that really makes such corrections a breeze. I do not work in layers the way many ppl do (could never get in the habit) and CM makes it really simple to manipulate color with a minimum of effort."
