I really enjoy the photo, the perspective, the vignetting and especially the colors. Only the left side of the door looks a bit too... strange maybe. Might be the skewed, liquified (?) left frame or the (very) white wall that makes the frame there.<br/><br/>Your \"backup photo\" is a great study in bi-color. The reds are gorgeous and the grey-tones that are mixed in, really complete the photo."
