    "content": "Still on the subject of style, re: your post on 11 Oct, this is one of your images that seems to take a small diversion from what I would typify as \"your\" style.<br/><br/>Usually your images tend to be more bold in the color palette, more striking in your choice of angular presentation, and overall more vibrant than the image presented here.<br/><br/>What's not different is the way you have balanced the composition, and your compositions are always well balanced. If not by subject, then by color and light. Indeed, color, light, line and texture often appear to take on the role of \"subject\" in your images. If not as the primary, then as a strong secondary. <br/><br/>This image is a perfect case in point. For me the subject is the light and shadow. The chair and plant serve to balance the composition, and the mood the image evokes is one that surfaces often in your work, which is a sort of quiet, contemplative feel.   <br/><br/>Now, I think most of these observations hold true on some level for most photographers, or at least the ones who pay attention to their work. What makes our images unique is the way we tend to make the same choices over and over when choosing whats important to us within an image.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't think we can help it. I think the style just oozes out. We can maybe direct it a little here and there, but we're slaves to it for the most part. Unable to change it anymore than we can our personal appearance by growing thin, or fat, or even putting on a pair of dark sunglasses. Cause no matter what we do to disguise ourselves, our mothers are still gonna recognize us... even when an acquaintance may not."
