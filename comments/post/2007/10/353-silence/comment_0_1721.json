Most of the time it is used in a very rigid sense. Mr A has style B. And the mechanisms of market really do their best to amplify this. I mean, when people can buy a Salvador DalÃ­ with crutches or one without, which one will they take?<br/><br/>But, of course, thinking about style the way you do makes sense. I really like the notion of choices and preferences. It's not always the same choices that we make, but more often than not, and our preferences may change eventually, but they tend to stay for a long time.<br/><br/>Hmm ... it's always a pleasure to converse with intelligent people, and enlightening too.<br/><br/>Thanks"
