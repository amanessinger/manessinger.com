This is mostly due to the fact that I was there when I shot the image, and that at that moment the train was about to take a curve from a darker street into a sunlit one.<br/><br/>I remember physical reality and from that point of view my approach may be correct, but of course that is only due to things completely outside of the image that I've finally created, things that don't translate into anything here. Yes, I admit, it is a little unbalanced.<br/><br/>... time passes ...<br/><br/>OK, I've changed it. You may have to reload the page in order to see the new version.<br/><br/>It's subtle, it's probably not even what you meant, but I do like it better now. Thanks.<br/><br/>Andreas"
