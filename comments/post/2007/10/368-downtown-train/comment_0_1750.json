What holds it back for me (and remember, I'm quibbling here about a masterpiece) is the darkening on the left. Now normally I try not to get into a technical review. But since this is an abstract it is driven by things technical. I wish you'd allow some more highlights to escape in those areas to better balance the work, otherwise it seems to tumble off my monitor on the heavy side. <br/><br/>Again, I am really quite moved by the power of this piece but it is as if you've not quite resolved a melody.<br/><br/>Ted"
