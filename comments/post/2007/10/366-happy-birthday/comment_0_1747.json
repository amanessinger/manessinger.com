    "content": "Corey,<br/><br/>When I'm refering to an image as \"HDR\", this is not precise. \"HDR\" means \"High Dynamic Range\", and HDR images are constructed from multiple  images of the same subject (ideally from the tripod and in quick succession) that have different exposure, normally one exposure value apart. This is called exposure bracketing, and normally one has a \"normal\" exposure, some that are underexposed but have detail in the highlights, and some that are overexposed but with detail in the shadows. I usually take seven exposures.<br/><br/>Then you use a special program to merge these images into an HDR image. HDR images are represented in 32 bit per color and pixel, enough to represent even the biggest contrasts. The drawback is, that you can't manipulate them and, worse, can't even properly display them. In order to do that, the 32 bit image must be \"tone mapped\" to a 16 bit or 8 bit image. <br/><br/>Constructing the actual HDR image is a simple and automatic process, tone mapping is eased by clever algorithms like those in Photomatix Pro, but the result normally still looks ugly. Now the art is, to work on such a mapped image and turn it into something that looks really good and not like the result of an algorithm. Normally this means to selectively apply contrast and/or saturation, basically all the things you would normally do to an image to make it pop.<br/><br/>Have a look at the homepage of the makers of <a HREF=\"http://www.hdrsoft.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">Photomatix Pro</a>. They have some good explanations and some ugly examples. Read also the article by <a HREF=\"http://www.outbackphoto.com/workflow/wf_a106/essay.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">Uwe Steinmueller</a>.
