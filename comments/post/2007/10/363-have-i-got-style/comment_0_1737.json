Just take your photographs - I would be able to pick them out from Flickr with my eyes closed (well, kind of... ;-) Simply, because you have style.<br/><br/>In fact, I would actually argue the other way around: there are far too many people who don't have a style - which translates to me more to \"personality\" or \"character\" than anything else (talking photographically). As such, \"style\" of course changes over time, with the seasons, mood, etc. But there is something that stays... And I like that."
