Harder to pin down with all the choices available, etc....<br/><br/>Still, I believe its out there. I like to think that I can see it in the works of many photographers that I admire. Your's and Teds, for instance, and pnf's. Identifying ones own style may not be as simple a matter as it once was, but like it or not we are all individuals with preferences that are often difficult mask."
