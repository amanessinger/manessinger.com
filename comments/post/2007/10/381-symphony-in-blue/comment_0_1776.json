I am amazed at the effort and commitment you have to maintaining a daily posting, there is a high volume of great stuff here, thank you!<br/><br/>I’m particularly susceptible to earthy fall landscapes captured with great variance in lighting – a subtopic in today’s post.  I’m fond of the Hudson River School of painters, a big deal in landscape art history in the States.  In this group of artists you can often see their use of lighting techniques to convey emotions through contrasts of light and dark.  You have that captured nicely and your “beauty blur” does a marvelous job of bridging the gap between reporting on a moment in time and conveying the beauty of the moment!<br/><br/>Regarding #381 – excellent!  High altitude, thin air, elegance and grandeur.  <br/>I enjoy your musical suggestions!  On seeing today’s image I heard Nate King Cole’s “Blue Gardenia”  and then Joni Mitchell’s “Blue.” <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Eric"
