As I've mentioned on my site, you and I work sooooo differently. You are methodical on the front end, working together impressive and highly detailed images. On the other hand my training results in a habitual effort to work fast and acquire volume. <br/><br/>But I work VERY slowly in PP. So at the rate I'm going, I shall not even open my Florence files {today's posting is an exception) for a while... heck... I may be seven or eight years until I get to the date of our shoot (just kidding). <br/><br/>There is a great therapeutic joy in looking at my photographs in a linear manner, searching each image for what I felt at the moment I pulled the trigger. Since that trip, and my postings are for pleasure, I hate to jump ahead in the story. So you can rest assured that it shall be a while until I get to the date of our October meet at sunrise in Florence. (although you know I did cheat and post one of those images the day after we did our shoot... Before my MacBookPro crashed in Italy). <br/><br/>I'm glad you finally got those well-travelled  prints, hope you enjoy the surprise I included. <br/><br/>Ted"
