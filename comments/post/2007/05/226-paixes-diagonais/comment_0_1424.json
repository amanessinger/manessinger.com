It took me 30 exposures to reach that point, but now I am quite satisfied too ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Regarding the Sigma, well, I'm a shallow-DOF freak, and if I wouldn't be somewhat tight on money at the moment, I certainly would buy the Sigma 20/1.8 as well. I saw some very impressive shots with it. And it's the same again: open wide, go very near."
