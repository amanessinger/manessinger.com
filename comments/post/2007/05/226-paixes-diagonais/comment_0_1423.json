In the past week I have especially enjoyed Sweet Confusion and  How Many Colors.<br/><br/>I appreciate your including the commentary about post-processing along with occasionaly info about lens choices, etc.  I'm like you with lenses--I tend to put a lens on the camera and work with it for awhile, adapting to a particular way of seeing.  I've been admiring the shots you get with the Sigma 30mm--perhaps that is one I should consider.<br/><br/>Cheers."
