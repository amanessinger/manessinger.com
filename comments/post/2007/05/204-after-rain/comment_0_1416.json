Maybe I had a sense that the horizon had been rotated but whatever it was, it works.<br/>And the light on the fence and grasses is nothing short of magical.  All those diagonal lines are in perfect synchrony, even the clouds continue the arching lines of the tree branches.   Great capture Andreas."
