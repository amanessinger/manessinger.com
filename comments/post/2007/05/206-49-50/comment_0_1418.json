    "content": "You're right about the composition here, it's a study in weight balances and linear mechanisms. First off the way the mass of the upper left is balanced by the dark/light interplay on the lower right holds things in check.. keeping that heft up there on the left from falling off the frame.<br/>Then the way the dark shadow on the upper right again offers to balance the mass across the frame from it works importantly to keep the teeter totter of this image steady.<br/>Finally, in terms of weight distribution, the great splash of color on the upper left his offset by the other corners.<br/>Then there are the lines all pulling the eye to that color pool on the upper left. Yeah... this is... as are so many of your tilt-a-whirl captures... quite formally composed... Is this our Germanic nature coming through? You can impose a powerful sense of order upon a seemingly random composition. And you do it so consistently and easily that it goes almost unnoticed."
