When  I click on the word \"comments\", the page simply gets reloaded. Am I stupid?<br/><br/>@Bill: Glad you like the flowers. There are so many of them now, that it's hard to avoid shooting them, but I think if I can I'll try to get some other subjects as well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>You may see some more shallow DOF though."
