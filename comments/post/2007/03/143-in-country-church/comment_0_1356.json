    "content": "This shot evokes some memories for me.  Several years ago, our family visited Austria as guests of a wonderful Austrian family.  Our hosts were great lovers of Austrian churches, particulary the country churches, and so we visited many of them.  Of course, each church is unique, but you have captured much of the feeling that one experiences visiting churches in the small villages throughout the countryside.  Having seen some of those churches, you have done a wonderful job with the contrast and lighting in what I imagine was probably a challenging lighting situation."
