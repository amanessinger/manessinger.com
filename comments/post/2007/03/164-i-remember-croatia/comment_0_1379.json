    "content": "There is such a state of possibility here. Is that a red and blue towel? If not, I want it to be one. That chair is an invitation to wait until the golden light fades. And longer. The boat, breaking up the block of squinting glass also invites, so does the towel. There's an anchor buoy just off this dock, another boat's coming. And that chair's the place to wait for it as well.<br/>I might have cloned away that pole behind the chair... but I am too picky. <br/>I want to sit there, or someplace like it soon. And wait for an evening boat to come home.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing<br/>Ted<br/><a HREF=\"http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">My Images Explained</a><br/><a HREF=\"http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker/\" REL=\"nofollow\">My Images Stored</a>"
