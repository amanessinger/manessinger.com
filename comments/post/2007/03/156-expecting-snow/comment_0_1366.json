I can feel the soft warmth here at my computer.  <br/><br/>I've been scrolling the photo up and down, over and over, to enjoy the two separate halves of this shot.  The top has the wonderful glow in the sky and the elegant shape of the tree.  But the bottom half has wonderfully mysterious shadows, a simple curve in the road, and lovely pastel colors.  Sometimes, viewing on the computer leads you to look at things in different ways, just as looking through the viewfinder does.<br/><br/>No, I don't often enjoy purchasing new hardware.  I used to enjoy it back in the days of DOS, when I felt that I was in charge of my computer and when each upgrade resulted in another order of magnitude boost in performance.  Now, most purchases plug in, harass me with some irritating questions about registration and then leave my computer working much as it did before.  Unless, of course, there is a technical glitch, in which case I am condemned to spending an entire weekend on the telephone with some alleged technician who seems to have only a vague idea what I am talking about.  Either way, the thrill is gone."
