MANLY.... <br/><br/>Now, having GROWLED like that... Yeah, I too am a gear head. What photographer isn't? And yeah, at parties men traditionally gathered to compare the, um, sizes of their... er... devices. Until recently. I was at a cocktail party and a bunch of beer swilling MEN were standing there, each swearing his was <i>SMALLER</i> than anyone's!!!!<br/><br/>How can this be? You ask? Well simple... they were comparing cell phones! <br/><br/>As for the image... see John's comments up above mind? DITTO!!!"
