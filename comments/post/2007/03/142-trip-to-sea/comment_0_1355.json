    "content": "Perhaps you explained and I failed to follow, but It seemed as if you asserted that this image was taken in early afternoon? Hmmmm... It has the look of much later in the day. And it's a lovely golden look with the feel of Agfa film. BTW, I really miss the tonal range of AGFA and I wish there was a software application which would allow my Canon to mimic those hues. Ah well....<br/><br/>More often than not wide angle captures with dramatic foregrounds result in a feeling of mystery. Your insistant foreground textures and iight actually create a momentum in this image which propels my eye to the wall of homes (???) which seem built to withstand the scream of ocean winds. And the slight barrel distortion reinforces that feeling strongly. It's as if ages of storm blasts have forced the buildings backward.. yet they stand like a castle wall against the siege. <br/><br/>Nicely done... and their golden light versus the well defined sky imbue it all with an optimistic (if still  mysterious) quality. I can imagine the movie which opens with this vista... The story will be a good one.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing...<br/><br/>Ted<br/><br/><a HREF=\"http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">My Images Explained</a><br/><a HREF=\"http://homepage.mac.com/byrneprintmaker/\" REL=\"nofollow\">My Images Stored</a>"
