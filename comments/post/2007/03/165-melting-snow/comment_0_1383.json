    "content": "Ooookay.... I have opened  Uwe Steinmueller's site. A couple of things come to my mind re. these images:<br/><br/>1. They have a comic book look. The colors are unsatisfying to me. Yet the colors in your image are totally satisfying. You are doing something different, I suppose. But what?<br/>2. Snce the point of this technique is to dig into highlights and shadows... and since shadows sculpt and define depth... the technique in  Uwe Steinmueller's photos results in flat two dimensional images. Not completely flat, but they look the way that comic book art looks... even the most photo representational drawings. <br/><br/>Hence the colors plus the effect in these images results in the sort of unreal image that pen and ink artists make. <br/><br/>Now that can be a useful effect, don't get me wrong, but in his images, and in those of many others, I find the results unsatisfying. It is a subjective reaction.<br/><br/>I did not have that reaction to your snow scene. I wonder what you are doing differently? Or is it the result of the fact that you are doing daylight outdoor photography. While  Uwe Steinmueller's results are distinctly comic book artist, yours are mildly painerly. <br/><br/>As Spock would say, \"Fascinating\"!<br/><br/>Ted"
