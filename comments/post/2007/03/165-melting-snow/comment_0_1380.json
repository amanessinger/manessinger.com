    "content": "Interesting painterly quality. This application is getting an expanding word of mouth support. You've illustrated some of its potential well here. I assume you used a tripod to do the multiple exposures? <br/><br/>Did you bracket fstops or speed? If you bracket f stops, don't you run into an interesting depth of field challenge? I tried this sort of HDR mutilple bracket burst thing only once. And wound up with multiple exposures which simply didn't overlay well. It appears to be a technique which is limited to still life photography... Am I right?<br/><br/>Ted"
