    "content": "Yes, I used a tripod. Photomatix has some more or less clever auto-alignment algorithm, but why risk it? In aperture priority mode I did bracket speed in terms of \"exposure values\". I set the camera to bracket seven exposures, each one EV apart. Photomatix ideally wants 2EV distances, but 1EV is the maximum distance that I can set. Then I took a burst in high-speed mode.<br/><br/>Only still life? No, not really. The main problem is motion. As long as you have enough light and not too much wind, I guess your results  will be OK. Again, Photomatix has some algorithm to compensate for the motion, but this will invariably have to increase noise.<br/><br/>For some good examples of interiors (and a good explanation) see Uwe Steinmueller's <a HREF=\"http://www.outbackphoto.com/workflow/wf_a106/essay.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">article </a> and the Steinmueller's <a HREF=\"http://www.outbackphoto.com/galleries/LightInTheDark/\" REL=\"nofollow\">Alcatraz </a> images. A very distinct look, nothing for all occasions, very painterly, but interesting nevertheless."
