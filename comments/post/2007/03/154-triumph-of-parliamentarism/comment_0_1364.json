Or is their worth no deeper than the grand edifices which they erect? Do governments in particular suffer from an inferiority complex that is visciated by contrived grandeur... or is the grandeur a real emanation of their value? <br/>Even small towns seem to build mighty courthouses, as if their respect would evaporate were it not encased and held prisoner inside mighty marble walls. <br/>Ah well, you raise the question wonderfully in this image.
