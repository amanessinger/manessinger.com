Also, I've not seen any other smartphone that I think that comes close in design, especially in ease of use. There is something to be said, in my book, about design. Add design + functionality, and you've got a winner. ðŸ™‚\n\nHave fun with the camera. I'll bet you'll get more use out of it than you had originally imagined, I know that I did!"
