And then when you finally go see how they're faring without your attention, they'll feel extra heavy when you pick them up! This is what's happened with my Nikon D300 - now it feels like a tank, compared to the Fuji X100.\n\nOh yes, you did post an image! That bright spiral cord reminds me of cucumber tendrils - and almost makes me feet that bike is alive!"
