    "content": "A lovely Pumpkin Patch - altho these are probably edible winter squashes instead of pumpkins of the type that we in the USA carve up at the end of October to make Jack o' Lanterns. Silly waste of food, but then pumpkins grown for carving up really don't make good pies.\n\n\"Pumpkin Patch\" is alliterative, whereas \"winter squash patch\" isn't. So I thought it appropriate to use an alliterative description for an image in which the subjects repeat themselves again and again.\n\nHugs,\nFlo"
