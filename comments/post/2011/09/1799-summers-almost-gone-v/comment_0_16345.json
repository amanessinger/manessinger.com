I like the POV - the diagonal of the fence support that moves across the image, holding together not only the fence, but also the rest of the vertical lines, visually/compositionally speaking.\n\nThe ivy will be there all winter. It doesn't care that this is officially the beginning of autumn. It simply grows, adapts, rests, then grows again when conditions for growing return. It's a survivor. We can learn much from these hardy plants."
