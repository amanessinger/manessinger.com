    "content": "Excellent composition which leads me easily into the depth, yet keeps me \"down to earth\" - not losing the touch with the exquisite watercolor. Very interesting color chords and overall a really serene moment. Nice, very nice!\n\nand the square format is one of the most important aspects here... provides room but does not force me to go anywhere, not up or sideways... I can simply float around.\n\ncheers\nÂ®"
