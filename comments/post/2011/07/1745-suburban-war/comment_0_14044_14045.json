While trying to find out if our carpenter was at home, so that I could deliver the cooking plate directly to him, I had to wait for a phone call. I used this time to make some images.\n\nLater, while processing this image, I had already decided for B&amp;W. I still felt the need for some drama though. There was a bright spot in the clouds directly above the roof, looking as if the sun came through, but given the shadows, this could impossibly be the sun. Could be an explosion though ðŸ˜„"
