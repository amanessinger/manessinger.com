    "content": "Wow! The paths of Love! This is one of your best visual metaphors I've seen, Andreas! I love it. It's so simple, yet the concept is so complex - just like us humans, huh? I wonder whether the \"blue\" artist was the same one who added the black and red? Looks like the heart was added after the blue squiggles.\n\nThose squiggles could almost be written in a language like Arabic or Sanskrit. Sort of wandering off into the desert - 40 years in the wilderness of love lost?"
