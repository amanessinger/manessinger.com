I should send you my recipe for shrimp gumbo with plenty of okra, but I am not sure you can get it there.\n\nAnother song with door in the title:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpJNadW0PIo&amp;feature=related\n\nIf you want a good feed for Cajun music, Google KBON.  A pay for feed from the heart of LA.\n\nLove the image and the link."
