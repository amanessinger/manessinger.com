Some things can't be done with an LX5, but the opposite is true as well. And yes,  it is much easier to carry, but the real benefit is, that I don't need a bag. At the moment I travel with a laptop bag containing my laptop, the camera, cables, cardreader, my Kindle and a few personal things like eye glasses and tooth brush. As soon as I use the D300, I'm back to a big camera backbag and still have less room left ðŸ™‚"
