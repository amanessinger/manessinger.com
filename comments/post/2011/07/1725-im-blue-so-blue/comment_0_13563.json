Looks like others have a similar situation: too hot to feel like doing very much, plus too much to do to fit into each day.\n\nThis blur symbolizes for me not only the heat, but also the impression of time passing by too fast to catch up with. Some days the events are blurred and I can't even remember what I had for the last meal, lol. And to think how, all during the winter's cold, I so looked forward to moderating temperatures, only to be plunged into the opposite extremes. Wish I had a mountain to go up far enough to get out of the heat.\n\nJust sign me Sea-level Flo"
