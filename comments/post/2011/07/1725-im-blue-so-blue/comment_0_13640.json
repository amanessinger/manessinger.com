I've noticed that since you started using the LX5 your pictures have changed, out of necessity of course, as the sensor/lens combination has different characteristics. I can't imagine it offers much in the way of shallow focus effects. This isn't to say I don't like your current output - I do - it's just different. And I'm sure it's easier to carry an LX5 rather than the Sigma/Nikon combo!"
