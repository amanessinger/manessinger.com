I've never seen pink - marble(?) in a church before.\n\nI too am not \"religious,\" meaning that I do not wish to attach myself to any one creed or group of belief systems. So many of them don't agree with my view of the world.\n\nI think there's a BIG difference between being religious and being spiritual. Religious people advertise their religiosity; spiritual people live their beliefs. Religious people will be happy only when everyone else belongs to their particular faith system; spiritual people show by example and don't advertise their beliefs.\n\nIf I've offended some, I'm truly sorry that you don't understand what I'm trying to say. I honor other people's beliefs and their right to believe them - but please don't try to shove your beliefs down my throat!"
