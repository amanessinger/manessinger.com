Be aware, tho, that some websites - and therefore, perhaps some videos - have special codes that tell the owner when someone has linked to and/or swiped something from that website. People who are freaked out by the possibility of copyright infringement of their stuff will be the ones who will incorporate these special codes to activate tracking software.\n\nAt least the people who produced that perfume ad won't come after you, because they'd have no way that you'd shot the image on the TV screen."
