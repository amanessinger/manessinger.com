    "content": "Hmm ... I buy Sony when I have absolutely no alternative. Just like in case of my laptop. Today there are other lightweight laptops capable of running Photoshop, but Sony still has the best LCD. Great contrast, great colors, no glare.\n\nEverything else, if there is any choice at all, I'm glad to skip Sony. Incompatibility and non-extensibility was always their game, but the real problem is, that they behave like the content company that they are today. Look at the recent PS3 disaster, look at root kits and other creepy behavior. I see no necessity in supporting a company that cheats and then sues their customers.\n\nAnd of course I think the NEX user interface would drive me mad ðŸ™‚"
