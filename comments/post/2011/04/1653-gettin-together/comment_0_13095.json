And here's a request... could you return to this spot and play with this fence? It is so damned intriguing to me. Dunno why.... but it seems so Olde Vienna to my never-been-in-Autria-except-in-books-and-movies imagination. So much elegance baked into something so utilitarian. The stone work, the iron work... the entire thing is just some architect's throw-away! Imagine that this is only a DETAIL! Was it considered just ephemera by the craftsmen? By the designer? I wonder who sat at a drawing board and lavished such imagination on this accessory? Was it a VERY junior draftsman? Was it a quickly knocked off pencil sketch by some great mind? Imagine the process. How many hours were folded into this thing. But... but... there they are... what  a century later? Centuries later? Whispering... \"Look here. I existed. Here it is... my contribution to you... so perfect... so incidental. But, of all the people who worked when I worked, lived when I lived, here... here's my mark. Still here. Will your's be somewhere to tingle imaginations and feelings? Huh? Huh?\""
