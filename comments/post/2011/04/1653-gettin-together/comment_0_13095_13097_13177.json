If they changed makeup, hairstyle, costume -- or if they were photographed at different angle, or were differently lit... They became to me unrecognizable from earlier pictures. Some people are color blind, it seems that in still photos, I am somewhat recognition blind. Now tha t makes the world continually new, but it also means that I'd make a lousy wittness if asked to pick a thug out from mug shots.... Now that you show me these two older images again... Well duh.... Uh-huh they are wonderfully additional ways for me to imagine answers to my earlier questions. Ahhh... As my old adage goes Andreas... <I> Art without wonder is merely craft!</I>"
