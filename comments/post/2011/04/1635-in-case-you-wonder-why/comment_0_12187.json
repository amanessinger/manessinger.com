    "content": "In general, for those generic comments, I tend to err on the side of caution and mark them as SPAM. I still have some get through, but as soon as I see them, SPLAT! Into the SPAM folder they go. I don't use Akismet, I use SPAM Karma 2 and have used it for years. It's pretty effective, but, on occasion, some will get through. Like you and Eric, I get email notification of all approved comments as well as those that need moderation. So, we have to have some manual intervention at times ... I'm happy that 99% of them are blocked. I'll take care of the other 1%. ðŸ™‚"
