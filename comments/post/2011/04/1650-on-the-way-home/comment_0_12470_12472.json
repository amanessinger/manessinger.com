Use either \"Luminance\" as blending mode or desaturate the background. You can also do that selectively. What you absolutely have to avoid is a deep blue of the background. \n\nOf course this comes at a price. Out of the camera a hazy or foggy background has not much detail. Increasing contrast also dramatically increases noise. With a far forest in the background this may not be that visible and you may get away with it. Just don't overdo it."
