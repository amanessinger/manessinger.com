    "content": "Thanks. The interesting thing is, that I could have gone in so many different directions. Color temperature, how much color, how harsh the contrasts, and so on. The semi-HDR process gives you material that is almost devoid of color, and two of the Topaz Adjust presets that I used, \"Spicify\" and \"Exposure Color Stretch\", greatly amplify colors, driving colors apart in a radical way, almost inventing them from subtle shades. \n\nNow it's up to you how much you use of what. This particular mix is color-heavy, going for a steelish/rusty look, but Topaz' preset \"Dramatic\" (pale, emphasis on contrast) looked good as well. The only thing that I definitely wouldn't recommend in this situation is looking for \"truth\". There is no truth in dealing with the sun in your frame ðŸ™‚"
