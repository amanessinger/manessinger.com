Not to mention the furniture and stuff in our house.  It's worse than ugly - it's downright distasteful.  Who in the world ever convinced us that this stuff looked good?  I have one picture of myself at a wedding wearing a leisure suit.  With some kind of Afro hairdo.  It's embarrassing.  \n\nI don't remember the sixties being that bad.  But maybe that's because I was wearing an army uniform for part of it.  And really short hair was \"in\".  We were also so poor that we didn't own much furniture and didn't have a TV."
