    "content": "I grew up in the '60's and, for me, it was clearly a decade of immense change.  Both personally and in a far more general sense.  I went from being a high school student to college to the military to married with a young child.  It was also the decade when I started working in a field that would last for almost 30 years.  And as I changed, so did the world.  The Cuban Missile crisis, the assasinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, race riots in the cities, and men landing on the moon.  The world in 1970 looked nothing like the world in 1960.  \n\nI knew it then and I know it now.  That decade was a clear line of \"demarcation\", for me and the rest of the world.  And yet, as you say, there is always the sense of \"stream of consciousness\".  An endless series of yesterdays that turn into today and life goes on.  In a sense, that is the curse of photographs and other forms of visual media.  When you look at the grainy images of that era, you realize how much time has passed and how much has changed.  \n\nMy daughter had a bike like that, by the way.  Don't see them anymore."
