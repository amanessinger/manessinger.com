    "content": "Nope. I used Topaz Detail to bring out the details in the bike, but for the colors I used three \"Hue/Saturation\" layers in different blending modes and with different settings. I've explained it in \"<a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/08/683-welcome-to-republic.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">683 - Welcome To The Republic</a>\". I use that pretty regularly, often with masks. The advantage is, that it avoids the clipping of color channels. You still have details, only the colors get much more vivid. Along with the fading of blending, you can get interesting effects."
