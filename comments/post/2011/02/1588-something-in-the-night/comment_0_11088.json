All photographers had 3 numbers only before we got kicked out and no Photographers pitt either. Which ment we are out with the crowd. This is in the days of film and prime lens. I got about 15ft from the stage getting pushed and shoved by the crowd with my 180mm lens ( nikon ) when Springsteen decided to jump into the crowd write in front of me. I tried as quick as I could to  change my lens to a 28mm but I was to late . Got the back of his head though. That was the 3rd number I then got kicked out. Still never mind. Andreas thanks for the PNG tip.I've checked all my blog and all is fine now.\nCheers\n\nSimon"
