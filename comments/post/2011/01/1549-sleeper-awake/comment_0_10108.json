Bach from his Cantata No. 140, BWV 140 \n\nSince you have windows lit up on two floors of this building, I'd say you have more than one sleeper who is awake, lol.\n\nI like this image very much - perfectly exposed - and cropped. BTW, I never knew there was a usable square in every image, lol! I don't think in many of mine one could find a useable square!"
