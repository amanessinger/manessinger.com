    "content": "Since I have long been a fan of frames, I will sit back and enjoy your \"frame phase\". \n\nIt seems to me that finding an image within the frame you originally captured is as creative a means of making a photograph as any other. Who is to say that some part of your consciousness didn't respond to this square as you were tripping the shutter?  What is here works beautifully. Gorgeous capture of the lightâ€”rim lighting and all."
