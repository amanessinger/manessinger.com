    "content": "The only way to get pictures from the PC on the iPad is via iTunes, and iTunes does something. They definitely create thumbnails, maybe they create intermediate sizes, but I suppose they also lower JPEG quality of the maximum size to a degree that is just not recognizable. On my PC the images that I have on the iPad add to more total file size than on the iPad, and that is only possible by lowering quality or by higher encoding quality. Photoshop produces small JPEGs anyway, so I suppose it's quality that is lowered. That sounds scary, but really, the images look just fine."
