I'll bet you're the only one who had been by there that day who would appreciate the beautiful of this slice of life.\n\nI do love the roiling water in the next image - did you notice how its surface formations seem echoed by those of the foreground rock?\n\nThe 3rd image reminds me of the images of the salt flats in Death Valley that people have posted (TME's forum) from time to time. Nature tends to repeat its themes."
