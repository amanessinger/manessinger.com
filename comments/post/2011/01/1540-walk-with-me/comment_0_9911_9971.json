This joint of two lines is such a non-obvious connection. It's just the edge of the sidewalk and an expansion gap of the bridge, but due to the way that I have framed it and how the lines run into the edges (and of course what the light does), we see those seemingly unrelated things as one subject. And you really must walk to see something like that ðŸ™‚\n\nAs to the water, well, sometime ago I had a water image where I have used a very long shutter speed to smooth lines out. This time I have made a series of about 10 images and then taken the one where the waves came out best. There is no other way to do that, because the water runs so fast and the image changes constantly, you can only spray and pray ðŸ˜„"
