    "content": "I agree with Ken about that spider shot! Amazing that it's out and about - and also that it ran so fast when you tried to make an image of it.\n\nThe water shot is so lovely with all those pastels - like water color - pardon the pun.\n\nThose ice bells - how on earth did they come about? Are those real bells of glass or plastic beneath an ice coating? I think this has to be the most unusual ice image I've ever seen."
