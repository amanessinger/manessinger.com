    "content": "Thanks all. Well, the ice bells, you don't see it here, but there was a twig, about 10-15 cm off the ground. Water drips down and makes icicles, and then the lapping water from the river adds to their base. It's all natural and it is not even uncommon. All it needs is a river, because without the coming and going of the waves, no ice would build at the base. Thus you would not see them at a pond.\n\nI really love this Tamron 17-50 with its close-focusing capability. I held the camera very low, below the twig, and focused to nearest. This way I mad a series of images until I got what I wanted.\n\nSame with the water image: without the Tamron's stabilization, I would not have been able to take the image. It's 1/4s, ISO 320, hand-held.\n\nSame with the spider. When I'm in need, this lens triples as a macro. Amazingly versatile."
