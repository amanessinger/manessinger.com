In this image, more so than in the others, the story is of the now-frozen water which had carried with it, like baggage, those rounded river stones. And like other travelers, the water dropped the baggage stones that became too heavy to carry.\n\nI also love the ice flowers that look like daisies in some of the other images. I might call them \"winter daisies\" or something similar."
