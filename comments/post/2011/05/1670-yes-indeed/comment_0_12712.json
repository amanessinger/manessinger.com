What I can add from my own experience with the LX3 is that I am highly content with what I got - this is a photographer's machine with the right buttons where they are needed. What I am missing most is a hyperfocal setting that you could dial into one of the my-something to have it ready immediately.\nAnd of course the viewfinder is, say, requiring adjustment, when you come from a DSLR. In bright sunlight and when wearing a white polo, it borders to useless. So yes, Colin, I understand your wish for an EVF. For me a OVF for square format might do, as I use the WA position almost exclusively, but the Panasonic one would cost me as much as I have paid for the whole camera."
