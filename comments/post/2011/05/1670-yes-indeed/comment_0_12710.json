    "content": "I'm extremely pleased with my LX5 and agree with all your comments. I would add though that although I can see noise, when I print A4 the results are equal to my GF1 and 5D Mk11 used handheld and no noise is visible. B&amp;W conversions are superb. I've never tried printing bigger, but I'm sure that would be pretty good too. It's a great camera but I do need that EVF!"
