    "content": "I think that getting up to 800 photographs with one charge is due to several factors: I'm using jpeg + 1:1 aspect ratio + no flash + no focus light + no automatic preview. Also, I don't keep the camera on for long - I switch it on, take a few photographs of a subject in quick succession, and then switch the camera off. Typically this takes 3-10 seconds for each subject. Also, I always have a spare battery, just in case."
