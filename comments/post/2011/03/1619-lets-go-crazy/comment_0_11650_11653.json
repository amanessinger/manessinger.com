    "content": "Yes, I did. I suppose I like the interface of the XZ-1 better than that of the LX5. The wheel around the 4-way controller is slick and the camera feels good in my hand. What won me over in the end were two things: 24 mm vs 28 mm, and of course the better display. The OLED display of the XZ-1 is dull compared to that of the LX5. Otoh, should one be willing to buy the electronic viewfinder, then Olympus has a gem and Panasonic something that's just barely usable - for the same price. No, it's mostly the 24 mm."
