    "content": "I bought an LX5 last autumn. I am extremely pleased with it and the results I get have surpassed my expectations. My eyes aren't sufficiently good enough to get away with using the LCD, and I already had a GF1 and the clip on EVF. I find the EVF to be adequate and usable for composing and exposing via the histogram despite the bad press that it gets on the internet. As you say, the 24mm focal length is a winner."
