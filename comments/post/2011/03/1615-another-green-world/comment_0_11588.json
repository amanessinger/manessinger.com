    "content": "Andreas, we seem to share the same thoughts about the gloomyness of the day as well as the LX5. While there is not much to do about the first - political ventings on photoblogs seem not to be received too well - the LX5 also for me is an object of long-time desire, and similar to you I haven't done it yet. I still have the feeling I will loose my familiarity with my tool of choice, and also will get my vision influenced by the new tool, and I am not ready for this. For the time being, my Sony together with a 16-80 zoom can do 99% of what I want, so besides comfort there is no real reason for another camera."
