(Which in the current configuration produces such gems such as the photograph here.)\n\nI'm writing this half joking, half serious. This is something I have been <a href=\"http://lightscrape.blogspot.com/2011/03/spring-skiing-and-on-rewiring-of-brain.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">thinking</a> about since reading Nicholas Carr's <i>The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains</i>. The book is quite controversial, but it is backed up by some fresh research.\n\nThe choice of a camera - or any technological tool - may affect how one sees the world. In learning a new camera you also learn a new way of seeing, and may lose some previous skills.\n\nOf course, I may be completely wrong claiming that cameras - and approaches to photography - are that different from each other. And in any case, what was once learned can be re-learned with relative ease."
