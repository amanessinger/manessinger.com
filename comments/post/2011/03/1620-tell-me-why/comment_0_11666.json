    "content": "\"I have switched off the autofocus assist light (weâ€™ll see how well this works in low light, but I can always turn it back on), turned all sounds off, and when I use the electronic viewfinder, this camera is absolutely unobtrusive.\"\n\nIn low light I usually switch to manual focus and put the LX3 to hyperfocal setting - the helpful display on screen is great for this. And the camera remembers the setting when you next need to use manual focus. \n\nWhat may be good for low-light work is a mini-tripod, the smaller the better. Mine is from Dealextreme and the price was about 3 euro including postage. This allows to put the camera on the ground, on various objects, to benefit from longer exposures."
