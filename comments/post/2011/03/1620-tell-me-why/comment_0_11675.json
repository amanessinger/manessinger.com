I didn't mean that one should try to focus on a subject through the LCD - I have done a couple of times when the LX3 has been on a tripod, and it is not really a pleasure. What I meant is to use the DOF range which is shown on the LCD to set up the desired range.\n\nThis of course works well only if you use aperture priority (I don't use anything else on the LX3). For example, you may set the focus range from 2 meters to infinity - a good setting for general street photography. Or set it to 1...3 meters and take photographs of subjects in this range. \n\nI have used this mainly in night photography, and also with motion blur: set the desired focus range and take photographs of subjects while walking/skiing/in a car etc. As a bonus, there is no focus lag so the camera responds instantly."
