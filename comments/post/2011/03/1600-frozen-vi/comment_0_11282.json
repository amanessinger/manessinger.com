It is overwhelmingly.... evocatively... narratively... overwhelming. As Saliieri said to Ms. Mozart upon seeing Wolfie's original manuscripts... \"Add one note and each masterpiece tumbles, delete one and each conflates.\" - Or something like that. \n\nThis is the work of a great artist at the heights of his powers. Perfection in every sense. Congratulations. You've set the bar quite high, even for yourself.\n\nTed"
