With the DSLR, 1/4 s is the maximum that I can use with similar (im)probability of success. Which ever way you look at it, I see a two to three stop advantage for the LX5 over the D300 with 17-50/2.8, at least when motion blur is not a problem. But then, I can of course put the 50/1.2 on my D300 ðŸ™‚"
