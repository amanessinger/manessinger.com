Now the ISO of 80 helps to explain the large lack of noise. But the tonal range in the black paint is quite acceptably deep - a characteristic that goes beyond sharpness and even contrast. Now some of that is a tribute to the lens used, but much is also an interesting comment upon the processor. It's a step beyond the black dog on the black background at night test. An interesting technological accomplishment, eh?"
