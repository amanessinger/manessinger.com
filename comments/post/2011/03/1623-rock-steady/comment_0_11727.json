    "content": "\"DOF penalty\", that is a good term. Small sensors do have some good properties...\n\nA small mini-tripod helps even in handheld photography to get a stable shot at 0.5...1 second exposures. You get a nice stable grip, eliminating some degrees of freedom. Although I guess having the EVF and stabilizing the camera against your face is a good technique also."
