    "content": "There's a very painterly feel to this lovely image, it has some romance and if there were some cattle leaning over the fence one could be forgiven for first thinking it was an oil painting from the 1800s! It's interesting because I've seen this same sort of result from my LX5 under similar lighting conditions."
