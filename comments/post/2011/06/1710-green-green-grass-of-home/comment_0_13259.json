Tweaking the nostalgic film mode was the way to go, but one needed to change the auto WB as well; I think it was the green-magenta axis you needed to tweak a bit. \n\nBut then there was a firmware update which changed things; no need to tweak WB, and even standard mode was borderline acceptable if you did some changes there. It may be different with the LX5, but your hint on using nostalgic sounds good."
