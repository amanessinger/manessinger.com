BYW, I left a post over on <a href=\"http://www.bungalow104.com/2011/06/08/contemplative-photography/comment-page-1/#comment-2312\" rel=\"nofollow\">April's blog in her Contemplative Photography discussion thread.</a> (I hope I put in the hyperlink right, as this is the first time I've tried it in here.)\n\nIsn't there a song with \"One-eyed\" in the title? Seems it might be an American Western song.\n\nI like your \"one-eyed\" bike. I like how the front wheel is turned at a slight angle to the bike's body - more effecting for the image this way."
