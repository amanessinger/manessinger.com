    "content": "That pair of photographs is a very good demonstration!\n\nFor some reason I'm not much disturbed by how the green is rendered in my LX3, as long as it is internally consistent within a photograph. Blue sky, that is another matter - I often have to delete photographs where it just isn't right. Greens - there is just so much variation in any case, depending on the amount of clouding, moisture, etc.\n\nFor example, right now I have a spruce in front of the window, and it is really, really artificial-looking green, thanks to the rain we had at night and the moist air, and the thickly overcast sky which saturates the colors. Also, there are some bushes used in fences in which the leaves are artificial-looking, almost like plastic, and one sometimes wishes the camera would stress the greenness even more.  \n\nWhat I find difficult are some subjects where there are really delicate greens; for example hazel leaves late in the evening where there is a little bit of clouding but not too much. The LX3 jpeg engine often produces photographs which differ greatly from each other even when taken seconds apart, and the results seldom are what one would like to have. \n\nOf course, one could fix things shooting RAW and doing work on the computer, but I just don't like it. I have learned to live with what I can get with the LX3 jpegs."
