    "content": "Both of today's images work for me - the \"empty center\" composition of the first one is a real eye-catcher.\n\nRe. viewfinders: As rewarding as photography with the LX3 can be, a good eye-level viewfinder is something I miss terribly. I started to select my clothes in respect to the camera - a white polo is a no-go for photography with the LX3 in sunshine, as all I see in the LCD is a reflection of myself. But a full tilt/swivel LCD in addition to a \"real\" viewfinder is more than only nice to have, as your off-zero-level composition of the 2nd image proves.\nI share your position re. Sony (the latest PS network disaster is only another brick in the wall, with the Sony-distributed-rootkit being the worst imaginable disregard of customers), but coming from Minolta, it was the logical path. My A700 starts to show wear and tear after 50.000 exposures, so the long awaited SLT A77 might be the next step, combining in-body-stabilisation, an electronic viewfinder that would allow to see depth of field again, and live-view with a hinged display. It might well be a killer feature-set."
