Had you been able to sit the camera on the ground, you might have lost the tilt. This is happy serendipity at its best, in my humble opinion.\n\nI feel like I'm a pigeon on the sidewalk, hunting for specks of food - and suddenly I look up and there's these big curved objects in my way. I cluck and decide to move around them, or maybe hunt in between them.\n\nMarkus, I too can not review my images in the Nikon D300's screen - nor can I use live view successfully when there's bright sunlight outside. It isn't only white clothing that's a no-no - it's any light colored cloth. Plus sometimes, depending on the sun's angle, even in shade, sometimes I can't see into that screen worth a darn. I do have the Hoodman, but it gets in the way and pops off if I'm not careful.\n\nI think that this is probably true with almost any camera's back screen - except for the Sony you mentioned, or with any screen that tilts and swivels.\n\nHugs,\nFlo"
