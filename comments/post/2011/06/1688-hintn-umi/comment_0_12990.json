How many of these sneaky images must one make to qualify as a paparazzi, anyway? LOL\n\nInteresting that the color is mostly near the top. My eye seems to get caught up by that bright red box in upper right. What would happen if you flipped this horizontally? Would our eyes then get caught in the upper left?\n\nHugs,\nFlo"
