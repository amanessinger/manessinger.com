    "content": "It's not only maple seeds, it's bird poop, pine and oak catkins, pollen in great drifts, etc, that'll hasten Nature's take-over of any car allowed to sit under trees for a while, in the springtime. In summer, anything goes. In the fall it'd be colorful leaves which would turn brown soon. In the winder it'd be the ice and snow accumulations.\n\nI did see another movie - or perhaps it was a TV program, about the end of humanity and what the authors thought might happen. But I'm not sure I finished watching it, as I don't remember what was their conclusion.\n\nPerhaps, once some aliens found out that there were no longer dangerous and hostile humans left on this planet, they'd land and decide to colonize? Let's hope they'd treat it better than we have.\n\nHugs,\nFlo"
