I mean, both are fine. A project gives you some kind of depth that you otherwise miss. I know it, I did SoFoBoMo three times, two times succeeding to a book, once succeeding to no book ðŸ™‚\n\nOtoh, just relaxing, just letting go with the flow, that's a quality that I wouldn't want to miss. And time helps you. The longer you do it, the easier the transition is."
