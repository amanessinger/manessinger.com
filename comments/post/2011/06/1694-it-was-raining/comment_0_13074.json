    "content": "Andreas, you often see things that many other do not see. I think you've trained yourself over the years to see in a different way that speaks of being able to shift mental gears in an instant - and you pass by a street or store or bike or car and suddenly become aware of what these scenes have to offer - in other words, I think you've trained your mind to anticipate nothing and therefore you are open to seeing everything in a new light. By becoming \"empty\" you can fill your mind with new perspectives, just as you did with this car and the raindrops on it.\n\nSomething about this car caught your mind that day, and so you stopped and looked, then looked through your viewfinder and composed and clicked the shutter. You didn't think about the \"rule of thirds\" or any of those other silly compositional \"do's\" and so you were free to compose and shoot this small scene abstracted from a much larger area.\n\nI hope this helps somewhat to understand why I think you're a contemplative photographer. In this sense, contemplative I think isn't the best word to describe the mental process - but it's the word chosen by other photographers., so we use it. It means a meditative state of mind in which I do believe we've really switched gears from the usual thinking, figuring Beta state to the more creative, open and empty Alpha state."
