    "content": "Well, when I had a Nikon D80, its skies were so cyan they were unbelievable. So I tried not to include too much sky in the images I shot with that D80. Then I got a D90. The skies were less cyan, but still looked artificial. Also it was impossible to get decent definition in reds and oranges and yellows.\n\nSo then I graduated to the D300 and I like the skies it produces. But as you say, Andreas, it's the greens. They seem to pick up too much cyan, so I'm always warming them up in one way or another. But at other times, it'll make the greens too yellowish and then I must cool them off a bit.\n\nAlthough I do like yellow-greens, they tend to draw the eye away from the subject. Bright yellow-greens can dominate and give the illusion of coming forward, even if the trees/grasses are behind the subject.\n\nThat said, I do like what you did with that landscape of the bright sunlight falling on the field.  I like that the color draws me into the image and I want to go explore further into that field."
