Usually I can do all those things using alternative (or should I say conventional) techniques, plugins are not compatible with LAB, and the there is the issue with dark areas. It's so easy to overdo them in LAB, causing unnaturally blue shadows or phenomena like that. Still, I don't regret having read the LAB book and having spent so much time using LAB. I've learned a lot from it."
