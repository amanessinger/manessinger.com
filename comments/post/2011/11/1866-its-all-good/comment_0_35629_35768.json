    "content": "April, this is a 12 megapixel camera and at base ISO its image quality is very good. It's slightly noisier than the D300, but you wouldn't see that in a print. Higher ISOs or extreme treatment in Photoshop are a different story. Yesterday I took an image of a far-away castle. At 600 mm it completely filled the frame, but due to haze the histogram was only a narrow band around mid-tones. It's amazing what you can get out of such a photo, but what you have to do in Photoshop is similar to the signal amplification that happens at higher ISOs. Although the image had been taken at ISO 100, the final image didn't look like that. DSLRs hold up better due to their wider dynamic range, but you can't expect miracles either. Thus: expect to be able to print properly exposed images at base ISO just as you would with the D300."
