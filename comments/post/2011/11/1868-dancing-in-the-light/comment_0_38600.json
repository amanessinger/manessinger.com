    "content": "The small point and shoot sensors can be problematic because the depth of field is so large.  I've shot a few photos out the window of my office and quite a lot of the time you can see the reflection of the camera/lens/me on the window.  A couple of weeks ago I took my Nikon D7000 in to shoot a few of the same shots and no reflections from the glass. Almost an infinte DOF with p&amp;s camereas.  But they sure are easy to carry around!\n\nJohn"
