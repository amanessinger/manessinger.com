    "content": "Ah, in the good old U.S.A. sales continue 7 days a week - even on holidays! Stores take advantage of the fact that on holidays there are many more people who have free time to buy things, and so they hold sales, hoping to entice some of those free people to come into their stores instead of going hiking or boating or whatnot.\n\nAs for selling papers, we have lock boxes. You must put your money in first. That triggers the paper to fall down into a slot so the buyer can reach it. There's also home delivery, which costs more, as a driver must be paid to deliver the papers - not to our doorsteps, but just to fling the paper into the driveway or front yard, or even into the bushes. Kids on bicycles no longer can earn money delivering papers. This is the situation in suburban and rural areas. I don't know how home delivery works in cities, especially in apartment buildings.\n\nAslo, talk about a throw-away society - nowadays the papers for home delivery are stuck into plastic bags so the papers don't get wet - even on dry sunny days!"
