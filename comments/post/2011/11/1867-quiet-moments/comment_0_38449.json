It's extremely hard for me to find simple subjects, or to be able to find an angle from which to shoot a complex scene/subject to eliminate the details.\n\nNow, it's interesting that while I'm trying to simplify, here you are in a current fascination with complexity!\n\nYou know something? In the case of this image, I agree with Roland, lol!"
