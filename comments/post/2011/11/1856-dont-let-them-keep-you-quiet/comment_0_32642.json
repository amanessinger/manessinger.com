Unfortunately, \"interesting\" not always in a very positive sense of the word. \n\nI'd agree that a l lot can be gained and lost in the education system, from pre-school to universities. That is why yesterday's people would like to have things like creationism taught, but not devilish things such as gender equality, humanity's impact on climate, social issues, political science, evolution or - God forbid! - that weird notion that the earth is circulating around the sun.\n\nAndreas, I wholeheartedly agree with everything you've written. Problem is, that - as also evident from Flo's comment - there are even worse things developing. Things that might have an even more profound impact on human society as a whole, including each and every one of us."
