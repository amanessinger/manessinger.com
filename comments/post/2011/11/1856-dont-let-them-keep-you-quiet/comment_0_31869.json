Or maybe we never did, perhaps it was just an illusion.\n\nBut I do have a case example of there having existed wise politicians. Namely, here in Finland in the 1950s and 1960s the school system was developed in such a way as to afford every Finnish child equally good education. There was a group of policiticans who drove through this program, and it changed the whole country immensely for the good.\n\nI'm myself a beneficiary of this wisdom. The Finnish school system made it possible for me to get an education - to move from a small farm in a small village, far up in the north, to high-school and to a good university. \n\nAnd this large-scale development changed Finland from an economy based on forestry and agriculture all the way to the forefront of the current \"information age\".\n\nBut today we have nationalistic and populistic politicians who blame schools for teaching things like multicturality, gender equality, social fairness, and so on. And this same school system has been evaluated to be one of the best in the world...\n\nBut I still have faith in Finnish teachers. They are dedicated, hardworking, and justly proud of what they are doing."
