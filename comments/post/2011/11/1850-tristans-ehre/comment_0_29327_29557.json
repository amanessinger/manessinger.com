See how the content industry constantly whines for Internet censorship and how the general public is lead to believe that it's for the best of their children. But what it really is, is just the same technology that Syria or Myanmar use to suppress their people. There's also no way that such technology \"in the right hands\" wouldn't be abused. We build the infrastructure that our next dictators will thank us for."
