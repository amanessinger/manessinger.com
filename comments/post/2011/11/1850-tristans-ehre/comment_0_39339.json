    "content": "Odd thing.... The taggers of the US seem to have influenced Graffs worldwide. As I travelled recently in Turkey, the design ... the craft... of their tags were virtually identical from those in the hidden alleyways around the Amtrak yards in Philadelphia. But there's an amazing difference in content. Here in the US, the taggers are rarely political. They are overwhelmingly the markings of people who want to essentially proclaim their personal presence... similar in a lot of ways to the way dogs mark anything that's vertical outdoors. But in much of the rest of the world the medium carries messages beyond egotism on steroids. \n\nDunno why that is. Oh wait... there is a way-marginall form of graffiti here in the States that has some socio-cultural-political content. But these are overwhelmingly stencil or sticker work. The Shepard Fairy Obama poster's a good example. Fairy grabs other folks' work, solarizes it, then mass produces stickers or silk screened versions. Sticker/stencil work is more likely to be a mass production rather than the individually crafted work of the American street tagger. \n\nOf course all of it defaces and degrades communities with the wailings of the few who have generally chosen to herd with hate, or at least with smoldering pain. Ah well, the uncovered walls of Pompeii are scrawled with graffs. I wonder if the cave paintings of Lascaux drew tut-tuts from their cave-dwelling neighbors? Did their artists strike in the night? Hmmmmmm....."
