    "content": "I think I have read four or five of the Potter books - but somehow I always felt there was something missing. Then I had a discussion with some British colleagues, concerning J. K. Rowling and Terry Pratchett; they thought that Pratchett was in another leagua altogether as a writer. \n\nI decided to try Pratchett (I gave up him earlier), and despite the somewhat uneven quality, I have felt that something was indeed there, a kind of sympathy which was missing in the Potter books. \n\nOn the other hand, I don't think there are many writers who can lead a reader in a book as tightly as Rowling can - you get a summary of all the previous happenings in so few pages that it seems like magic, and you don't even realized that Rowling is doing the \"fill in the backgroup\" part of a sequence of novels.\n\nBy the way, that is a vey nice square up there."
