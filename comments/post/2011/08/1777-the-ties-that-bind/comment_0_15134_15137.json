    "content": "Thanks. Well, this transition comes from a partial B&amp;W conversion with a soft mask. I've done this a few times in the past and it seems to work pretty well for eliminating distracting color on the periphery. I think it's not a plastic bag either. It's one of those red/white ribbons that are used around here to secure construction sites. Someone had fastened it to the metal ring in front of this window (the wood is an outer window sill, the cracked paint in the background is on a window frame), but didn't find it necessary to untie it properly.\n\nAs to \"letting things happen\", I really think we all do that, more or less, and normally much more than we tend to believe. It carries the stigma of \"not being in control\" and of bohemian carelessness, but of course that's stupid. The outcome of our \"decisions\" is influenced and often forced by so many factors and forces, that it would be ridiculous to even think about having them all \"under control\". We sail along as the wind blows and most of the time we are happy to nurture the illusion of steering a little. And that's probably OK. Doing otherwise would be enormously tiring, ultimately fruitless, and in the large it would make not so much of a difference anyway. I think what really matters are the \"moral\" decisions. Do I bribe or take bribes or do I not. Do I turn someone in or do I not. Do I give freely or do I not. Do I hate or do I love. Do I vote for security or do I vote for freedom. Do I embrace change or do I fear. These types of things."
