I got a weird look and I must admit that at the time I wasn't sure why I said that but when I thought about it a little I realised that it was totally appropriate. My so-called decisions seem to just happen, the consideration behind each decision just happens, the consequences just happen.\n\nAnyway both images work for me. Interestingly on first sight the plastic bag appeared to me as something organic, decaying but organic. It actually took a few seconds for the bag to register and when it did I thought what a perfect transition from organic to plastic."
