    "content": "A few years ago, I had a sudden invite to an impromptu evening of music by Pat Metheny and Charlie Haden. They didn't know that they were both in the UK at the same time, and when they found out they put on an evening of fantastic music that I'll never forget. Seeing Haden slumped across his instrument as if it was a part of him was amazing."
