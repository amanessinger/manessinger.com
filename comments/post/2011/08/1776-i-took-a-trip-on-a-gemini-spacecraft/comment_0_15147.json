BUT... imagine how you will keep those 4 TB picture data backed up on a second drive AND make sure you can still read the data in a few years... this gets creepy. Data maintenance takes time and harddisks aren't meant to be long term storage.  How easy was it, to archive a film strip, compared to make sure your archived digital files can really (!) be accessed in a few years."
