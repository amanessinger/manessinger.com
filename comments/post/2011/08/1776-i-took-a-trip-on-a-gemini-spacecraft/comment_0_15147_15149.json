    "content": "Not that hard either. I have two computers in two places, Vienna and Carinthia, currently with 4 TB each, and I keep them in sync by carrying incremental backups on a 500 GB USB drive. If the hardware in one place fails, I always get nervous though, and I try to get to safety as soon as possible. Sure, freak accidents could happen in two places, but I guess I can live with that risk. \n\nIf I wanted to, I could add a tad more safety by buying two additional drives, mirroring the two drives in one place, and storing the two extra disks at work. By doing this every few months, I could bring the risk down even more, at least for everything older than a few months. Hmm ... not sure if the paranoia is warranted though."
