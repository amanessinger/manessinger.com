Many drives fail to even start, if you let them lie for two years. If you use them all the time, you should get used to copy the WHOLE shebang every few years. And if you keep them as RAW files, make sure you can still read those files in lets say, 10 years... meaning you need a software that can read them. There's no guarantee in that."
