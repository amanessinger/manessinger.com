But it really doesn't suggest anything about your personality, I agree.\n\nI've often used a pure black, a pure white, a middle gray, or a B&amp;W layer to increase contrast, to open up shadowed areas and tone down highlights - usually with Overlay, but sometimes Multiply will work, too. But I never thought to make any of this into an Action. I rarely use Actions, anyway, as for me, each image is truly an experiment. I often end up doing something entirely different from what I'd originally intended, too.\n\nAlso, sometimes I use a Filter&gt;Stylize&gt;Find Edges layer to sharpen, instead of the usual tools for sharpening. Multiply, usually. Sometimes the Find Edges layer works best on top, other times it works better beneath the other layer(s).\n\nFlo"
