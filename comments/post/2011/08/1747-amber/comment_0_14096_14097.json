Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes I save the result, sometimes I throw it away and sometimes it becomes something else. None of this is a statement, none of this is meant to mean anything. It's experimental and I fully accept when it often leads to nothing. On the other hand, some of these things sometimes lead to surprising results, results that surprise me as well.\n\nSome don't ðŸ˜„"
