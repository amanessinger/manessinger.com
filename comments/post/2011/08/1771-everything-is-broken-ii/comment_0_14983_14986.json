    "content": "Affordable Macs are perfect as mirrors, not so much as computers. Macs without a built-in monitor are much more expensive than PCs, comparably under-powered, lack some of the software that I depend on (well, actually only my image database) and they have awful keyboards and mice. Add to that a kind of corporate arrogance that is only rivaled by Sony, and you have a lot of reasons why I avoid buying Macs.\n\nBtw, I would also never buy B&amp;O audio or TV equipment. I need affordable, working pieces of electronics, not modern sculptures ðŸ™‚"
