    "content": "I built my own PCs for years and eventually decided I wanted the convenience of an already configured machine.  I have a new Dell XPS 8300 that has one(!) slot available, though it does have a couple of empty bays.\n\nI found your HP experience similar to mine with an HP printer - I just needed some replacement rollers, but alas, the model I had was no longer in production and there were no replacement parts available. HP's solution?  By a 9180.  Well, I got a new printer all right - a Canon Pixma Pro 9500 Mk II.  Great prints, but tiny (11 ml) ink cartridges.  It's always something.\n\nGood luck getting everything back together!\n\nJohn"
