Apart from the dots-in-green result, if you have a lot of ojne colour close together, especially reds, (eg the roses at the end of Wollzeile in Vienna) they seem to just blur together into massive blobs. I suppose I need to do some more research.  The low angle, focus at the front approach seem to work well, as in yours.  Is the Panasonic better for this?"
