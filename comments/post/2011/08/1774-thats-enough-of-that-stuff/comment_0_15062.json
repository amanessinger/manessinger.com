    "content": "Certainly not a pretty picture. But here in the USA, we do have a few TV channels that are devoted to telling us how things are made and what these manufacturers are doing to lessen their impact on the environment. They also have other programs about how things like tires and cars are recycled. I don't mean retreads and restoring old cars. I mean how discarded cars are crushed and how the various metals and plastics and other substances are extracted and put to good use to make other things, including more cars. The tires are mostly synthetic rubber now and are also being recycled to make housing materials, insulation, mulch, etc.\n\nSo the picture isn't as bleak here in the USA as you see it in Europe, Andreas.\n\nThere are also programs to show us the products we can use to make our homes and vehicles more energy efficient. It's a slow process right now, but as the word gets out, more and more people will demand more efficient ways of doing things. Manufacturers will follow where the demand is.\n\nBut you are so right about how advertising is designed to make us want more and more \"stuff.\" This year I'm buying only food, gasoline, and products I use in my house for cleaning, etc. All the manufacturers hope that more people won't start ding like I am doing, lol."
