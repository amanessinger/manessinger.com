    "content": "I didn't particularly like Portofino. It's all designer shops and jewelers, and seeing expensively clad guys half my age going on board of 30 meter yachts, golf bags over their shoulders, ... it does not make me envious, it makes me feel a little out of place. It is no desire to belong though. There is so much pose in that, so much ritual, so much needless waste of life time, in a way it is like watching an expensive but boring movie. Of course there's also something like obscenity in that kind of most likely unearned wealth, at least in a world where people die of hunger because traders bet on rising food prices. \n\nWell, maybe a tiny bit of envy ðŸ˜„"
