Open the image in Photoshop, go to crop mode, span up a square, make it proportionally smaller (Alt-Shift-CornerDrag), and then shift the square around inside the image, if you feel like that even rotate it. You'll be surprised. It's just like looking through a viewfinder, and you'll notice that there is hardly an image without a good square in it ðŸ™‚"
