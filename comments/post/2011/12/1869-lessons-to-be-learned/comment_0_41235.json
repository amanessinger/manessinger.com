    "content": "LOL, Andreas, when you analyze something, you really go for it! You asked do you know anyone with an X100? If you mean the Fuji X100, yes, I have one. But it does not have a zoom lens. Just a fixed one at about 24mm or maybe 28mm. Sometimes it's wider than I want it to be. So I doubt that you'd be interested in it. It also won't shoot square - only 3:2 and 16:9.\n\nBut it'll stitch an in-camera pano of 120 or 180 degrees - but you have to practice your slow and level steady panning motion to get it \"right.\" It shoots video, too, at either 24 or 30 fps, but it chooses this for you.\n\nThe one feature I appreciate almost more than its small size and weight, is it's leveling indicator - the horizontal line shows you the degrees off level and will turn green when you actually have it level. No more draining the ocean off to the right, lol. This leveling feature is wonderful when shooting videos.\n\nAll in all, it is a fantastic camera and lives up to all the hype it got before it was issued. But it does have its limitations - like every other camera model I know, lol. What may be an almost-perfect camera for one person won't be for another person.\n\nBTW, while I still remember it, I like this image of yours very much."
