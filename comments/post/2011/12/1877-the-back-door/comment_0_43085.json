Why two sets of steps, tho? \n\nIn the historic districts of cities in the USA, stately houses of the wealthy often had a split-steps entrance like this. The explanation is that the ladies used one set of steps, while their gentlemen escorts had to use the other set - so the gentlemen couldn't \"accidentally\" see up a lady's skirts if he were following her!!! I mean - horrors! Perhaps this would turn them into lechers!?"
