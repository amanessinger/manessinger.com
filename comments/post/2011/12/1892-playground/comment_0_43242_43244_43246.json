Well, I've carefully searched through all the menus and finally the manual - and if I'd read the manual from cover to cover, I'd have discovered the meaning of that yellow camera icon with the shake lines - it is supposed to mean that the shutter speed is low enough that blur may occur!\n\nSo why is my little yellow camera icon on all the time? Must be a bug, then!\n\nAndreas, thanks so much for pointing this out to me, lol, and you don't even own one!\n\nHugs,\nRed-faced Flo"
