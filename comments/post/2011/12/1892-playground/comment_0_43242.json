An attractive niche though, and essentially the same as my PEN with the 17/2.8. Still, its lens, excellent as it is, canâ€™t be changed and the camera has no stabilization at all. Fine, but not for me.\"\n\nThis camera DOES have stabilization! But you have to <b>turn it on</b> for it to work. Its icon that shows in the LED screen on the camera's back is a yellow camera with the shake marks on either side - plus there's what looks like an exclamation point to its left.\n\nThis stabilization has worked beautifully for me, except of course at slow speeds of, say, 1/5th sec or so. And that's when I'd really really love to have stabilization!\n\nThanks for the run-down on the various camera models. I'll have to check out the Olympus E-P2 and E-P3, with your comments in mind."
