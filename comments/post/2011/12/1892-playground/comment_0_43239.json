    "content": "Earlier this year, after the E-P3 was announced, I picked up a slightly used E-P2 with EVF and two lens for a very resonable price.  With a couple of adaptors I've been able to mount a couple of old Olympus OM lens and my nikon lens with it as wellâ€¦as manual focus of course.  It is good enough that it was my main camera for a trip to Europe in late summer and I've been happy with it over-all -- I do which the AF was fast like the E-P3 but that not a deal breaker.   I went in to it with reasonable expectations so I've not been disappointed.  I agree with most of your reasoning. \n\nHappy Holidays, Markus!"
