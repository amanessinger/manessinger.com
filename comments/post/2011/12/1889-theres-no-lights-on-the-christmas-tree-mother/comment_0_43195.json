    "content": "New Olympus pen camera - very cool.  I've actually been toying with the idea of  either one of these or perhaps the Sony Nex-5n.  To be honest, I'm stilling having a hard time grasping Sony in the camera business (or Samsung, or Casio).  But, that's slowly giving way to the fact the Nex-5 and 7 are just great cameras.  My heart's with Oly though - my first SLR back in '76 was an Olympus OM-1 and I have fond memories...\n\nHave fun with the Oly - that's a great shot by the way.  Happy Holidays!\n\nJohn"
