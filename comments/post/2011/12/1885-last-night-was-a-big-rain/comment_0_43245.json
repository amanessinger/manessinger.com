(about a year ago ðŸ™‚ it is my way to keep up to date with your images. i know it is not as funny to visit them and sometimes comment on them. so again i let you know, you do still have your secrets admirers. ðŸ™‚ and wouldn't i love your images they are always good and many times they surprise me. as this one does ðŸ™‚) it's a miracle what water, lights and reflection can do with a camera ðŸ™‚ even more what you can do with all this and your camera.\nso i wish you such nice days with all the ones you love. and for another year a lot of terrific and surprising images of every day life ðŸ™‚)\ncheers, andreas ðŸ™‚"
