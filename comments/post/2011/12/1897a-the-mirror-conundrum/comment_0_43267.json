    "content": "First I wanted to agree that this version looks better than the original. Maybe because of the \"block\" on the right side of the original one. This stops the eye before the frame which is not the case in the mirrored version.\n\nBut ... but if I look longer at the first image I \"learn\" to see the beauty also there. So .. it's just a matter of habit.\n\nThere are so many rules in photography and habits in seeing, I think its good and even necessary to brake them to refresh the view and avoid lulling the senses. Not to please at first sight may make the subtle joy last longer.\n\nI read an eBook by Andrew S. Gibson: „Beyond Thirds – A Photographer's Introduction to Creative Composition” on this topic. Very nice. At my <em>German</em> blog there is <a href=\"http://www.subhash.at/fotoblog/nicht-regeln\" rel=\"nofollow\">a little review</a> if one is interested. In fact it was the third posting in a few days about rules in photography and why they are boring and some times annoying. Surely breaking conventions can lead to failure but also there is great potential in it.\n\nSo ... I had to see your second version to enjoy the first. I have to break the rules more often myself to learn to see anew!"
