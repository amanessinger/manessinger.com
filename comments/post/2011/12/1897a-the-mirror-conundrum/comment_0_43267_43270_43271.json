Have your subject on the side where you begin to read the image, have some room on the opposite side to move into. The original had it all reversed, this one complies to the rule - and it works for me. It's disturbing though that, regardless of what you do, you always frustrate a part of your visitors. Or maybe they just don't come back if you don't \"speak\" their visual language."
