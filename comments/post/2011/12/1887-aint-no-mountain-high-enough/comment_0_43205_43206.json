    "content": "Basically what I wanted was a camera with a better viewfinder (the Olympus VF-2 is great!) and better low-light characteristics. ISO 800 on the PEN is great, ISO 1600 is acceptable, probably comparable to the LX5's ISO 400. This makes for two stops, but wide open we lose a stop, because the Oly lens is only f2.8 vs f2.0. Both are stabilized, so that's more or less a draw. I wanted the camera to be sensor-stabilized, in order to be able to use my fast Nikon lenses. That requirement alone eliminated all other EVIL cameras.\n\nMFT has no fast standard zoom though. The best option would be the Olympus FT Zuiko digital ED 14-35mm 2.0 SWD. It only goes from 28-70 (equivalent), but constant f2.0 is cool. All Olympus MFT cameras can autofocus with all FT lenses (not so Panasonic cameras), but this given lens is not on the (short) list of lenses optimized for contrast AF (whatever this means), so it may autofocus slowly. The downside is the price. The lowest price that I can find is from a shop in Poland, and it is still 1853.78 â‚¬. Plus an adapter. No option for me ðŸ™‚\n\nI may try the Tokina 11-16/2.8 for Nikon though. It works with my adapter and I already have it. Expect me to use this combo next week ðŸ˜„"
