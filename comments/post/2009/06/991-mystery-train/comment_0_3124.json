    "content": "Ahh, Harnoncourt was one of those who started the period instrument frenzy. Already around 1970 he had complete recordings of all Bach cantatas. I saw him only once, two years ago in Salzburg, with Purcell&#39;s King Arthur, and he was fantastic. In two weeks I&#39;ll be in another concert in Graz, Haendel&#39;s Jephta, more like his usual stuff, but tomorrow it&#39;s Gershwin ðŸ™‚<br /><br />As to the image, yes, in a way. Topaz Adjust remaps tonal values for all kinds of local contrast games. I guess you could call that &quot;tone-mapping&quot;, although the focus is not HDR."
