Not suprisingly, the thing I enjoy most about the book is what I always appreciate about your photographs. You have a distinct and effective style that sets your work apart. You won&#39;t be surprised to know that my favorite images are those the architecture and the sunrise sections. It all comes together for a very handsome book."
