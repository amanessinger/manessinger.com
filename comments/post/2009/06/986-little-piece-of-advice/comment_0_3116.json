I did not finish sofobomo on time, one day late, but all the work was done within the 30 day window.<br /><br />The reasons go something like this:<br />1) I intentionally did not set a deadline as I did last year in order to reduce stress. It worked, the stress factor was much lower.<br />2) After completing the photography I almost did not make the book. Last year I did not have a pleasurable experience making the book, it was work.<br />3) July the first was Canada day and I found myself with some time, so I made the book.<br /><br />I found a much easier way to put together the book, though it&#39;s quality may suffer. <br />1) I did not include story and theme, I just let it happen, and let the photos stand alone.<br />2) I composed the book for electronic consumption, viewable on screen only. last year it was all formatted for paper presentation."
