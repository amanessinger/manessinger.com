When it comes to artistic expression, it almost seems necessary that there be disagreement ... that fosters diversity and uniqueness.  As far as craft development, there is a lot to be learned from those who have great mastery so I&#39;m always willing to listen even if it comes across a little bit arrogantly.  Eat the meat, spit out the bones ðŸ™‚) Peace"
