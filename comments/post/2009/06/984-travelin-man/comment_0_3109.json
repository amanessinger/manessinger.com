He obviously composes his images to a high degree, more than anyone I know. For me that is pure magic, maybe especially so, because I feel in a very similar way. <br /><br />When I compose, I balance. Subject matter is not completely unimportant for me, but it is not that important. What counts is balance. Mark is the Zen master of the perfectly balanced Square.<br /><br />It&#39;s hard to describe. I feel it, it strongly resonates with me, and what completely fascinates me, is that he can do that with every single image, at least those that he publishes. It&#39;s not that I can&#39;t do one thing or the other quite well, but not with such machine-like consistency. Mind though, that there is nothing machine-like in his imagery, it is only the consistency and the precision.<br /><br />Does that make any sense?"
