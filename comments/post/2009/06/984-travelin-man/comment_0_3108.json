They look like snapshots that I would discard as soon as saw them. Mind you, this is not an ad hominem argument, merely my opinion about his photography and a question as to what you see.<br /><br />That said, it&#39;s good that he sticks to his guns and does the type of photography that appeals to him, no matter if I like it or not. ðŸ™‚"
