For me, his images totally lack any soul, depth, or sense that there is more to the subject than just the subject.<br /><br />I would say that your photographs are quite different than his. Yours do not lack that soul. For you, it seems, there is something more that you wish to convey, rather than the subject as a mere subject. Your bicycles for instance are a bit more. Perhaps I&#39;m reading into it what I want.<br /><br />I guess that I just don&#39;t &#39;get&#39; it. ðŸ™‚ That&#39;s OK, though. I think, too, that what keeps me from probing deeper is his huge ego."
