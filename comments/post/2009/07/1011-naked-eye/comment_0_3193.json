    "content": "The headline photo works perfectly fine with me, the B&amp;W treatment is perfect. Although I would more attach it to a post about internet privacy.<br /><br />Concerning that ongoing discussion about copyright infringements etc: I have to admit, that I feel somewhat caught between the stools. On the one hand, I agree with you. The attitude of major labels is somewhere between ridiculous and plain offending. <br /><br />On the other hand I would object the notion that everybody (or even most) who is a regular &quot;customer&quot; at piratebay is also purchasing a lot of media. I know more than a handful of music enthusiasts who own a couple of 100 Gigs of music. Non of it legally.<br /><br />But whatever the current discussion: The current business model of music labels and film companies will have the same fate as the profession of scribes when Gutenberg invented the printing press: it will vanish. What we are experiencing now is a dead cats bounce."
