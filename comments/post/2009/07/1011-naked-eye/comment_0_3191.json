The problem is, that they are so damn good at lying. Creating illusions and lying, the necessary skills are just the same, and this is one of their core competences. That&#39;s why they are so dangerous.<br /><br />The other problem is, that all those in power are just old men. They don&#39;t even know about the culture that they are threatening to destroy. It does not mean a thing to them. They think of the Internet as a traditional medium. Broadcast. Know what I mean? <br /><br />They have no clue, but the money to destroy whatever we built in the last two or three decades. THAT&#39;s the reason why we must stop them!"
