I was and still am always more than impressed by the standard at which you are able to keep your daily photos. <br /><br />I can really imagine that it feels swell - even more so when you can look back and actually have enjoyed the journey. <br /><br />Some time you should put together a book with the 42 most remarkable photos of those 1000. Just a a kind of retrospective exhibition for all of us... I would enjoy that!<br /><br />Congrats again - and looking forward to the next kilo!<br /><br />Thomas"
