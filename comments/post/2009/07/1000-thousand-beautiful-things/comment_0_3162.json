DAMN!!!! Congrats Andreas... It is not so much that you have show the tenacity to create a thousand posts... nope... it&#39;s the quality of the posts Yeah, your work has grown... but imperceptibly because it began from such a high level. <br /><br />Wonderful my friend... it&#39;s been a treat to follow along as you sparkled so consistently."
