It is somewhat like using active imagination as a way of uncovering some of the hidden gems within.<br /><br />I also used Blurb for my sofobomo book and am very pleased with it - well with them (two books).  One is the small square (7x7) and the other is landscape (8x10).  Like yourself, it is important to be able to hold them and get comfortable with them.  Any bigger and it would be about my ego, not about the work."
