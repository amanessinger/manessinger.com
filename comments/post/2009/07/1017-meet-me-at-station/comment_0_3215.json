There is truth in all points of view. Perhaps style is a longer view, maybe in 50 or 100 years when digital photography has morphed into something completely different people will look at our images and say that&#39;s an &quot;Andreas&quot; or a &quot;Ted&quot; because the work was excellent and has survived as lesser work did not. So maybe style has more to do with creative excellence than good repetition."
