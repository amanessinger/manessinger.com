    "content": "&quot;Style&quot;, I think, is a lot like &quot;personality&quot;.  Saying that someone has a style (or a personality) is the easy part.  Defining or describing it is something else.<br /><br />As Ted says, we can often make a good guess as to the &quot;author&quot; of a work (whatever the art form) by looking at it or hearing it or reading it or whatever.  There are always clues.  No two people do anything exactly the same way.  There are always detectable differences and it is those differences that allow us to say that this particular work was probably done by so and so.<br /><br />I agree with those who say that style is something that we should NOT be concerned with (it sounds like Andreas and Cedric both lean in this direction).  Let someone else worry about it.  &quot;Style&quot; is a mental construct that can only impede or hinder creativity.  A style is nothing more than a self imposed rule of behavior.  And who the heck needs that?"
