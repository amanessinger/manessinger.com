    "content": "Developing a style was once important to me as I thought I could pick the style of the photographers who&#39;s work I admired. I thought that to become good at this art form, to become recognized, it was necessary to have a style. But as I became happier with my images I came to the realization that I was not or ever would be an artist and that I did not <i>need</i> recognition. At that point I was no longer able to define style even though I was sure that at some point I had defined it. After all I could still pick certain photographer&#39;s images from a lineup but as Ted above mentions, I cannot put into words that which differentiates one photographer&#39;s images from another.<br />Once upon a time I used to take full credit for my own work and it was then that the concept of style seemed important. These days I simply feel fortunate that wonderful images present themselves to me. Less and less do I feel like I had anything to do with it other then to be in the right place at the right time.<br />As I said, I am no artist but I suspect that those who are, those people we admire would never stop to consider the question of style. Perhaps they do what they do because they are fated to do it."
