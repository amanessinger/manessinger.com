However, I will venture into this. <br /><br />I find that putting questions, impressions, or feelings into words often helps me to clarify my thinking. Of course, much of what I write for my blog is meaningless blather; still,I enjoy having a place to share thoughts and feelings with others and I have become increasingly attached to a small community of photographers who enrich my journey in photography.<br /><br />When I began posting, I had no idea whether or not I had staying power. Now, I will be celebrating my second anniversary tomorrow, and I see that the discipline of keeping my blog active (I am not disciplined enough to post every day pays off in many other ways. <br /><br />I would highly recommend blogging to others."
