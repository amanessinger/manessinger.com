    "content": "There are many reasons to write a blog, but for me it concentrates on two aspects: the personal impetus to publish  work in form of words or images, resulting maybe from similar roots as the artistic urge to create.<br />The other reason at least for me is the framework this provides to make me step on, to not slip back into procrastination but to develop my skills and to reflect my development.<br />Those two get combined with the communication and feedback I get through comments and sometimes email contacts that can provide invaluable help and support.<br />The timeline aspect you noted, Andreas, is definitely an important point, but to address this I would probably rather create scrapbooks. No, for me the communication and development aspects are the main reasons to write and publish."
