That picture had three parts, the left, the right and the part behind. ðŸ™‚ Anyway, the parted ones are interesting to me since they make my eyes and mind ask what&#39;s going on, I get problems with near sight and long sight focusing, and so on. After a while I start to look at the parts individually, trying to make them one in my mind instead."
