Pretty much a year ago I bought this lens the first time, <a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/07/648-inbetweenies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">used it for a day</a> and finally traded it in for a Nikon 85/1.8<br /><br />I have no idea if that lens had been really worse than what I have now, but then I had some AF problems that I don&#39;t have at all now."
