Have a look a the pictures most of his followers publish.<br/>As for me when I found his photos last year I suddenly was transfixed  as well.<br/>But i would be more careful about the term dense. I have read the article. It is far from what Mark is doing. The article seems to go only on the complexity of the subject.<br/>I am more on the side you describe, that of the look. But that is not enough. Mark also has a highly dense set of references. Eggleston, Weston and Emerson. The latter for straight photography is the certain reference. I am sure, given his multiple references along the posts, that the is quite well aware of this."
