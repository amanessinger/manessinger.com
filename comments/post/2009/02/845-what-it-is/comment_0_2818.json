And with your postings, if you miss a day, you're a bit behind!<br/><br/>So you've gone over to the \"dark side\" huh?  (Just kidding.)<br/><br/>Seriously, though, this whole concept of dense photography or seeing things \"plainly\" is, for me, just smoke and mirrors with a camera.  It's roughly analagous to adding more words to a paragraph or more plots or storylines to a novel or more notes to a musical score, all the while keeping things as commonplace or as mundane as possible.  <br/><br/>Your image, for example, certainly has a \"sense of place\" for you, and probably many others.  But for most of us, it doesn't.  And there simply isn't anything there that's out of the ordinary to command my attention.  I could drive through the city of Rochester and take countless similar images at any number of places.  But why would I?  How would that be different from what I can see any day, anytime?  It's the same question I've been asking Mark for some time: What's wrong with photographing the unusual or the unique?  Conversely, what story am I telling by photographing something that can be \"plainly\" seen by anyone, anywhere?  It's true that we tend not to see the mundane in our lives.  We pass right by them.  The point is, we have seen them - we choose not to see them anymore for a reason.  They're just not interesting anymore.  That doesn't mean we've lost our ability \"to see\" things.  It just means that the ordinary is just that - ordinary.  <br/><br/>At one point you say that for you, dense photography is \"context and relationships between things\".  And that is different from any other photograph - how?  Isn't that what every photograph is about?"
