    "content": "The brain is a lazy piece of meat. It only gets so much power from the body, so it conserves it... frequently floating along through its inputs, translating only those that grab its attention and allowing the rest to pass into oblivion. Which is to say that much that we look at may as well not exist, because it is invisible to us because it goes unprocessed. <br/><br/>That means that it is VERY difficult for the artist to even see the everyday things. Worse yet we become negative toward even looking... or over-riding our brain's filtration process. How many times have you said, \"Can't do that, I've done it before.\" or \"Can't find anything new there... to boring. Need to turn my eyes fresh upon something new.\" And so on...<br/><br/>And that means that we find it hard to really create a sense of place since we no longer use our lens to picture... show... create that place. We can no longer bring our sense of subjectivity to the commonplace because... the brain is a lazy piece of meat.<br/><br/>And here you have found a device to \"Plain See\" or to see the plain. This Dense Picturing is a way to pull back from picturing the gem and instead seeing the necklace... the model... her admirer... the location in which he is admiring and she being admired... and the culture that created it... all in a palette and framing which is sufficiently unique that no one has ever experienced that way before. <br/><br/>I'm happy that you've discovered this macro world and while your micro pieces have added up to an ability to pierce your thoughts ... these images do open a larger window. Wonderful...<br/><br/>BTW... the palette is particularly resonant in these images. Were any of these images the result of a tripod support?"
