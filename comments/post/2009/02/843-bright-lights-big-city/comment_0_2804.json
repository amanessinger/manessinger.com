No way you could capture those color circles in a normal JPEG, at least not without letting everything else go black. DxO is quite good in rescuing highlights that would otherwise burn out. And then of course this lens is unstabilized, I need 1/100s to get decently sharp results, and that often means highest ISO in current light. Another area where DxO excels."
