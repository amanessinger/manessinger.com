    "content": "You say &quot;Wide open of course all lenses have some degree of purple fringing... &quot;, and there you have it. The fault of this lens (and seemingly of most older Nikkors, at least the AF-24/2.8 behaves similar) is the amount of that &quot;some&quot;. Good modern lenses reduce that to almost nil, while I&#39;ve seen some images that I simply couldn&#39;t take with this lens. Wide open, yes, against the light, yes, but that&#39;s something that I expect from a general-purpose lens.<br /><br />But again: it&#39;s not a bad lens, to the contrary, it&#39;s only a much more specialized lens than I&#39;d like. Nobody said it&#39;s a macro lens, but I still would like to be able to focus nearer than 80cm. Same with purple fringing and micro-contrast when used wide open: There are ways around, but I&#39;d like to not having to care."
