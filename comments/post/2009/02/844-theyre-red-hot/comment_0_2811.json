The lens is superb at that apertures, it's only below f2.8 that it is problematic, and then only when there are blown point lights. The problem is, that I frequently use my lenses under such extreme conditions.<br/><br/>Chrome on a bicycle is pretty much a worst case scenario, and I LOVE bicycles ðŸ™‚"
