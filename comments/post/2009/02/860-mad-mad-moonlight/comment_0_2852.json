    "content": "Sigma 50/1.4. It's an extremely versatile lens. Second would probably be the Sigma 20/1.8, but this is so subjective, nobody can give you any useful advice. It depends on what and how you want to shoot.<br/><br/>For me it makes a big difference whether I use a prime or a zoom, but for other people it may not. I keep a focal length for days, weeks and sometimes months, but other people change constantly.<br/><br/>If you don't have it, I suggest you get the Nikon 50/1.8 and have a look at how comfortable you feel shooting with a short tele. Some people hate it, some like it. If I were you and if I were not sure about my focal length preferences, I'd get the Nikon, maybe even a used one. It's cheap when new and used you may get it even cheaper. Use it for a while, it's a killer lens. Best value for the money. Should you find out later that you like the range, you can always upgrade to the Sigma for the bokeh.<br/><br/>But maybe it is not bokeh and speed what you're after. Sigma has a very affordable 50/2.8 macro. It perfectly doubles as a street lens, it is sharp as a razor and if you want to get near, you certainly can.<br/><br/>As I said: there is no answer that anybody could give. You have to try, and your best bet is to minimize potential damage. You could even buy used on eBay and sell later. That's quite a good way to try different things without much monetary committment.<br/><br/>As a rule of thumb I'd say that finding the preferred focal length is more important than any particular lens model.<br/><br/>Let us know how YOU decide."
