I realize it is about personal preference so I very unimaginatively posed it as \"what would YOU buy if it could be your only...\" to get a sense of what you've come to really appreciate.  I was already heading towards the Sigma 50mm but I've seen so many Sigma 20mm shots that were really great ... even though critics really pan that lens ... lol.  Mitchell Kanashkevich loves it too.  hmmmm ... difficult decisions.  I wish I could just buy three or four but I really need to space them out ðŸ™‚)  Plus that let's me enjoy them one at a time!  Thanks again ;D"
