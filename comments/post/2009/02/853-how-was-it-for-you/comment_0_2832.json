Around 80% of my photos are shot with my 17-55/2.8 zoom, which would be 27-90mm on a full frame camera. <br/><br/>But I'm still dreaming of a prime at around 20mm with a max aperture of 1.8 or something like that. But that would need to be a 12mm prime. Haven't seen that one with such a wide aperture for my Canon."
