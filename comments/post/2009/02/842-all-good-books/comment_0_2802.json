    "content": "Andreas: That's an impressive collection of books. I, too, love to read and it is a constant sense of wonder to people that I don't watch television or read the news. I prefer books and am rarely without one to read. I, though, make good use of the library. In my car, it's books on CD. In the house, some fiction book or another. One can get so absorbed with good writing.<br/><br/>Also, like you, I'm either out with my camera, blogging, or as of late, practicing my harmonica while I listen to blues. Other than that, it's either heading to work or heading home.<br/><br/>I've not learned another language, completely, but I can get around in Brazilian Portuguese. My wife is Brazilian and her parents don't speak more than 2 words of English. So, I need to be able to speak more than a few words of Portuguese! Oh, and I'll be 47 on the 20th of February!"
