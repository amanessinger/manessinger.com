At the same time, I know that appreciate is something that needs to take much time... So what to do?!<br/><br/>Today I think is better don't do everything I really want, but what I can do, do it at the best way possible...<br/><br/>[I tried to be understandable, but if I don't, tell me, so i could find other words... I'm still learning english (actually I discovered I can't even say that I know my mother language, Portuguese...)]"
