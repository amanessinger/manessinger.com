(the more realistic view in stead of the surrealistic ones.)\nthis image makes me want to be in Karinthie in this time of year. long walks through the woods. \nsun beaming and enlightening the path ahead of me. \ncamera at hand and sure that will be the moment to proof the HDR technic myself.\n\nhave a nice day, andreas ðŸ™‚"
