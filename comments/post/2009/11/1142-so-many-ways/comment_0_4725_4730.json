It's interesting: after I had finished the image, I had the feeling of having changed a lot, but when I compared the JPEG from the camera and my version, then it was not much more than greater detail and some minor shuffling in tonal values, plus some saturation. It's not the JPEG from the camera, but it is quite near."
