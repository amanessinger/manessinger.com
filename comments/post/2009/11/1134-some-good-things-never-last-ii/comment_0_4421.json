    "content": "I used to use fill flash, either on camera (pop-up or flash gun mounted on the camera), but I found I liked the results better when I got the flash off the camera. But last spring my Nikon SB800 fried itself, so now I use only available light.\n\nAndreas, I do like this image - it doesn't look like fill flash at all."
