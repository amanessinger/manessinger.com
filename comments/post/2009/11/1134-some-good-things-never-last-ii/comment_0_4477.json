You can change it all the way up to +3 and all the way down to -3.\n\nUsually start fill flash at -1 or -2 flash EV.\n\nAs for those other settings, lol, you'll have to consult the camera's manual, as I've also forgotten what each does. The only ones I have set in common with yours are rear synch - useful when shooting moving subjects at slow shutter speed, as it puts the shadow behind rather than in front of the flash-lit subject - and also allows for ambient light to register before the flash fires. Modeling light is a pre-flash that helps the camera figure out how to do the flash exposure."
