I'd turn modeling off. It makes for a stroboscope effect before the actual image is taken, basically to let you compose in darkness. Hmm ... interesting, default is \"on\". Flash shutter speed, well, I'd reset it to its default of 1/60s. This is the shutter speed that you get for the built-in flash as soon as it sets in. Low levels make sense in low light, when you want to record more ambient light (in relation to flash).\n\nWhat I've done here, was to use -1 EV flash compensation and +0.7 EV exposure compensation in aperture priority, matrix metering mode. This is severely trial and error.\n\nA better approach would be to check what you'd get without flash, knowing that the twigs and berries would come out much too dark. Then set the camera to manual, dial in exactly those values for aperture and shutter speed, and from there to add flash, just as Flo said, beginning at -2 or -1 EV flash compensation. You can't lighten the sky with flash, thus the only effect will be to lighten the foreground, but the sky will still be exposed in a \"natural\" way. Note though, that you can't get a faster shutter speed than the one set as \"Flash Shutter Speed\". Well, you can, but you need external flashes for that.\n\nBut then, most of that may be wrong. If I would really want to know about these things, I'd do some research at <a href=\"http://strobist.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Strobist</a>."
