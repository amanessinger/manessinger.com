    "content": "I have the same focusing problem with my vc model. It seems the lens has problems focusing when I use focusing points other than the middle one ( I own a canon 450d). I have only had the lens for a couple of days but other than the problem I have just mentioned I am happy with the lens. Having a constant f2.8 throught the zoom range offers more versatility than mu 17-55 IS kit lens. I should mention that I am a relatively to photography, so my opinion of this lens may change as I get more experienced."
