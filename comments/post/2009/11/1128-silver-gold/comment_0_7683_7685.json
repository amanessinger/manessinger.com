The bag was closed, it is well padded, I didn't even look inside, because I was sure nothing bad could have happened.\n\nNot so. While all other lenses and the camera were just fine, the Tamron was broken. Not the glass, but the barrel. There was a gap between the lens mount and the zoom ring. I sent the lens in for repair, Tamron asked no questions, and I got the same lens back (I checked the serial number), it was fixed, and since then I have no AF problems any more. They must have made a firmware upgrade.\n\nUnfortunately I got the lens back with another, new problem. When I have not used it for a few hours, the first shot tends to be overexposed, because the aperture fails to close upon exposure. The camera meters at f2.8, and when I have dialed in, say, f8 and when the aperture does not actually stop down to f8 upon exposure, the image is overexposed by three stops.\n\nI had the lens for a second repair, it's better now, but the problem is still there. I suppose though, that this could be a mechanical problem, most likely a consequence of the fall.\n\nThus: Tamron seems to have fixed their occasional AF problems. I never had them again. I think it must have been a software bug. Overall the Tamron lenses seem fragile though. At least mine is."
