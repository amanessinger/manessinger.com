    "content": "I have got the focus problem with my 17-50 VC as well. In my case itÂ´s a result of turning the focus-ring when the focus-button is set at auto-focus. The only way to get it focus again, is to \"restart\" the camera, just as you mentioned. \n\nI was very happy with the Tamron 17-50 VC until I bought the Canon 15-85 IS (lucky bargain 125$!!). The Canon lens focus a lot faster and more silent than the Tamron. I also prefer the bokeh and saturation of the Canon, but I guess this is a matter of taste. In addition the focus-range of the Canon is almost twice the size of the Tamron. I regard the 15-85 IS as the best all-round lens in the crop-camera segment, and use it at least 75% of the time. If I need a larger aperture than the 15-85 IS offer, I most often use my Canon 50mm 1,8. I only use the Tamron in relatively dark settings that recuire wide-angle, and the use of flash is either prohibited or by other reasons not prefered. I would rather recommend the combination of Canon 15-85 IS, than a Tamron 17-50 VC. In addition the 15-85 IS fit much better than the 17-50 VC to a Canon 70-200mm. I think a set of 50mm 1,8 or 1,4, a 15-85 IS and a 70-200mm IS will cover most photographers demands. If you regard 3x zoom, IS and f2.8 extremely attractive, I would rather try the Canon 17-55 IS. I have only tested the 17-55 IS a couple of days, but in my opinion this lens is far better than the 17-50 VC.   \n\n(Sorry, my written English is horrible. I promise to improve it in the future.)"
