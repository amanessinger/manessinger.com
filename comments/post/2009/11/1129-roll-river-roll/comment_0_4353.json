    "content": "Andreas, I have an old Tamron 200-400 mm autofocus lens that I've never had a problem with on about 5 different Nikon bodies. \n\nBut, I have a 3-yr-old Tamron 180 mm Macro autofocus that's just not sharp. In fact, my favorite camera dealer wouldn't take it in trade, due to the sharpness issue.\n\nRecently I bought a Tamron 90 mm Macro autofocus lens. It has a switch for autofocus/manual and another for short range/long range autofocus. At times it won't autofocus, so I flip that switch and then it'll behave. I don't like the lens so will probably trade it in for a Nikkor 100 mm Macro.\n\nI'm thinking now that I'm going to stay away from the Tamron brand! I have a Nikon D300.\n\nIt could be that when you seat the lens into the camera, one of the electrical contacts doesn't quite mesh properly - and you may bump the lens while using it, causing this contact to malfunction. But this doesn't explain why turning the camera off and then back on makes the autofocus behave."
