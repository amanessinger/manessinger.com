Experience with D300/D700/D3 preferred, as they share the same AF module.\n\nAs I said, I am no action shooter, when it happens, I simply turn the camera off and on again, but for others it may be a real show stopper. For me it's just the compromise, the price to pay for an otherwise fine lens. \n\nAnyway, there may be even more to it. I guess the D300 has problems with this lens on AF points where it works just fine with other lenses. AF may really be the Achilles heel of this lens, but otoh it's still too early for conclusions. You know the effect, you see a problem in one aspect, and soon you suspect problems everywhere. \n\nI plan for a rather tedious experiment with the Nikon 35/1.8 and this Tamron, set to 35mm, different AF points, focusing from infinity to a certain target, the same from very near to that target, making the images without much care, just as one would in action, repeat 10 times for every lens and point and focusing way. Count the perfectly focused vs slightly focused vs unfocused images, compare by lens. Oh dear, it's tedious to just write that ðŸ™‚\n\nAnyway, that's the plan."
