    "content": "Andreas, I don't know if this is chance or if it could be related, but I have a recent generation Tamron AF28-300mm F/3.5-6.3 XR Di VC LD Micro lens which I have experienced the AF problem you describe. It doesn't happen very often  and I cannot find any sequence that will cause it to happen each time.  When the AF does stop working I usually quickly turn the camera off and on and that starts it working again.  I've used the lens with a Nikon D700 &amp; D300 and have had this happen with both camera bodies.  \n\nI returned this lens once to Tamron Repair for a problem with the VC (grinding noise).  They fixed the VC problem and said the lens checked out OK.  The AF problem however still happens on occasion.  I don't use this lens much anymore, mostly because I feel it lacks sharpness at certain focal lengths, but the random AF issues are also a bothered."
