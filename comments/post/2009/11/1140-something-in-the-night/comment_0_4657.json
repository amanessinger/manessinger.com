But we also would benefit by remembering that painters do exclude or include elements that they think will add to or distract from the finished scene as they \"see\" it in their mind's eye. So if people accept that painters do it, then why can they not accept that photographers do it, too?\n\nIf a photograph is supposed to convey a story of an event and the photographer's intent is to render it exactly as he/she experienced it happening - then of course there should be no compositing, adding or subtracting - otherwise as evidence in a court of law, this photo would not stand up.\n\nBut if the intention is to convey an emotion, then - much of the time, it may be necessary to do some \"diddling.\""
