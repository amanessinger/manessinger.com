    "content": "Thanks. Regarding lenses, I have three primes in that focal range, the Sigma 28/1.8, the Sigma 30/1.4 and the Nikon 35/1.8. The only lens covering the full 35mm frame is the 28/1.8. It's also the biggest, the heaviest, the one that focuses closest (20cm from the sensor plane, that's not much from the front lens) and the one with the best bokeh. It's cheaper than the 30/1.4 and it is sharp as it gets. Try it on your camera, I have no idea how it behaves on full frame. On my D300 it is a fine slightly wider than normal lens and I love it."
