    "content": "A hard decision, definitely, hard as the steel (? alloy?)  bar in your image. Up until recently I completely relied on zooms in that range, but went through three of them until I settled for the CZ 3.5-4.5 16-80. Reason for the exchanges: sharpness. At least I can rely on in-body-stabilisation, so I get this advantage even with my primes. \n\nBUT: In our latitudes, a fast lens is indispensable, and in bad weather and/or in a hurry a zoom is more than just a convenience. That said, I recently bought a fast prime, want to buy a 2nd one (the Sigma 1.8/28 because of your glowing descriptions)."
