It did trouble me though. Great to see you on my new site!!\n\nAs to the sax, yeah, I can feel that as well. On the other hand, those songs are really only a way for me to browse my own music. Searching for a title forces me to hear things that I probably wouldn't have heard otherwise. Hmm ... not so true for Tom Waits, I hear him regularly, but actually I came back to his work via this exact thing. He frequently turned up in the titles and I began to hear him more often ðŸ™‚"
