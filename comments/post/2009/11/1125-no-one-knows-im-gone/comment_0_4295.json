Not all of them are touching, not all of them are of the kind that one would expect everybody to love them, some are very analytic and they often analyze small aspects of our life and the environment we live in, many speak with a low voice, but they always do so very precisely. As images they are consistently excellent. That's the truth and not many photo bloggers are on that base level. Mark \"The Landscapist\" Hobson is, I know I am not."
