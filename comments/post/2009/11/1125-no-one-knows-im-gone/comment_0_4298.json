    "content": "Wonderful shot. Nice selection of the eye candy that one can encounter on a tram. Sometimes the limitations of photography work just fine. It's simply great to not have to cope with all the background noise, the sometimes not-overly-pleasant smells etc. \n\nThe glowing colors of the window frame in combination with the out-of-focus discs make the image for me."
