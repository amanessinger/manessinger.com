I looks a lot like my old bike from more than thirty years ago a 'Flying Dutchman' from the more famous brand Gazelle. So i think this is a bike from that period in the seventies 🙂\n\nyou'd got an antique one for your lens yesterday, (or at least it's one that you can tag with bric-a-brac) 🙂\n\nhave a nice day, andreas 🙂"
