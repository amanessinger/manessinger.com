(breathing wasn't a pleasure ðŸ™‚)\ni did post-processing till 1:00am, so no PS for me, that early, in the morning. ðŸ™‚\n\ni like this image\nespecially the reflection in the, huge in sight, building\nit let us show more of the street than without this reflection\n\nthe bikers and the leaves of the tree are a welcome foreground detail\n\ni'm not sure about the post-processing\nit's that marvellous treatment with the filter you often use (lately)\nsometimes i love what it does with the colors\nsometimes it's making more noise (so it seems, it isn't, i know) in a not so special way\n\nbut i *do* like the business on the street, so early in the morning\nthe light is special at this time\na brand new day before us\nto make things come true\n\n(i love your last comment and i will write a reply. busy times here, won't let me do this at the moment ðŸ™‚)"
