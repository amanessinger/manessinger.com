    "content": "That's funny. Looking up is something that I always did, even in my youth when I was drawing, not photographing.Why? I don't know. It's a dream thing, similar to seeing things isolated and out of proportion, imagining being there. It must be connected to playing with cars and planes and soldiers and cowboy and indian figurines in my childhood. Let a cowboy climb the bark of the apple tree and imagine it is a rocky cliff. That sort of things."
