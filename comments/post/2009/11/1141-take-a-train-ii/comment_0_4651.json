Love the complementary colors also.\n\n\" (...) the bokeh of this new Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC is not bad either.\" I agree.\n\nI am glad you decide to open a new page. I like when photographers comment their own work and process, their projects, their thoughts or feelings about photography. A title ?  KEYS , although I like Disclosure or Process."
