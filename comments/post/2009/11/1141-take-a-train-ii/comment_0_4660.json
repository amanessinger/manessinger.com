    "content": "Andreas, this time the color scheme is simpler than the image you produced the day before, shot at 5 p.m. I like the focus point that you chose, also. You must have been standing when you made this image. The POV makes me feel I've just boarded the train and am about to find a seat and sit down. But I'm glancing ahead to see who else is onboard. The vanishing point seems to be almost in the center, but not quite - creating a little more tension.\n\nI do like the though of another page of explanations of your approaches to shooting - and post processing. Name for this page: how about \"Behind the Scenes\"?"
