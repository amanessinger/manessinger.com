I'll do almost anything to keep power lines out of a shot, although if I can't avoid them while composing I won't resort to cloning them out.  I can't give you a rational reason as to why.  As you say, they're part of the modern landscape.  I just don't like them, I guess.  Heck, I'll go to extremes to keep people out of most of my compositions.  Unless they're useful for scale purposes, I'd rather not include them.  I'll try to wait until they're out of the frame.  Maybe in my mind power lines and people are simply part of the clutter.  And if there's one thing I hate, it's clutter!"
