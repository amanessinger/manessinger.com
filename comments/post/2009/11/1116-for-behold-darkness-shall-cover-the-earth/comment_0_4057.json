    "content": "Thanks all.\n\nStreetlights, yes, I'm sorry. What I did to the original? Oh dear. It was a little bit noisy, Only ISO 1600, but because of the strong highlights, I had to resurrect the shadows. I used Noise Ninja, cloned out some stains on the ground and some cigarette butts, added two layers of Topaz Detail, one in Soft Light and 50%, one in Normal mode and 30%, grouped and restricted to the scooter with a mask, added a blur, saturation with my usual three H/S layers in Soft Light (blended in the shadows), Multiply (blended in the highlights) and Soft Light again (blended across tonal range), with adjusted Lightness and Saturation sliders, grouped and dialed back with opacity until it worked. Then some edge sharpening in Luminosity mode. Well, about that.\n\nApril, thanks for pointing out the resonance between the coil and the word \"BUS\" on the ground. I felt I had to crop like that, but I didn't see it.\n\nEarl, interesting interpretation. For me it was all about a youthfully arrogant pose, Jimmy Dean-like. The arrogance of the ever young, just like the Vespa itself."
