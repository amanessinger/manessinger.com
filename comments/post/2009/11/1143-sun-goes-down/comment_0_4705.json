    "content": "Howdy Andreas!\n\nI bought a Tamron SP AF 17-50mm 2.8 XR Di II VC LD Asp IF on the 20th at my local camera shop (arlingtoncamera.com) for $629.95 with a $25 mail in rebate. I took it off a few days after I purchased it (very briefly) but it has not been off my camera since then. I absolutely love this lens! \n\nIt is certainly cheap when compared to the Nikon equivilent (without VR no less) but not what I consider a cheap lens. The Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX is a cheap lens. The Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 SLD DG Macro is a cheap lens. They are both inexpensive and perform on par with the price.\n\nI am not sure what I love more, the close focus, the sharpness or the creamy bokeh...\n\nI've uploaded a few shots to Flickr that were taken with it:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Tamron%20SP%20AF%2017-50mm%202.8%20XR%20Di%20II%20VC%20LD%20Asp%20IF&amp;w=all&amp;s=int\n\nI took a few more shots today despite the rain and my back glass being shot with a BB gun. I will be uploading them to Flickr as time permits (and tagging the same way)."
