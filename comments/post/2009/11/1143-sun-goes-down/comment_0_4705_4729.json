Even the Nikon 17-55/2.8 is not what I would consider \"standard\". It severely lacks stabilization. That's even true for the current 24-70/2.8, but people seem to excuse that. It's still interesting that Nikonians are the only pro camera users who are denied a stabilized 24-70/2.8 (or equivalent). Canon has it, Sony, Olympus and Pentax stabilize the sensor. It's curious that Nikon gets away with it ðŸ™‚\n\nAs to the Tamron: you will love it, and especially so in dark places."
