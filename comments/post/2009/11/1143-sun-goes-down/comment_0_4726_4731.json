My results from the HDR programs are normally much in need of contrast and some saturation. I really use the HDR mappers to contain the dynamic range.\n\nAs to buying it again: yes. I am really, really satisfied with this lens. I suppose for a Canon user it would be tempting to spend more for the stabilized Canon version (maybe), but for Nikon you really have no choice. I could imagine (well, I really can) buying the Nikon 16-85 as well, and to use that as the \"sunny weather travel zoom\", but what I needed and wanted now, was something for the long night that is winter ðŸ™‚"
