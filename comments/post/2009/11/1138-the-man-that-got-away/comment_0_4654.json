    "content": "There is definitely place for both photography and photo illustration, but the criteria to judge them cannot be the same, e.g. the composition of a still life or any kind of photo illustration have to be to the point whereas for an unmanipulated street scene, I would rather be less stringent on that point.\nSo, yes I would like to know whether something has been added or removed from the composition. \nOne can argue that a flash is some kind of manipulation as well. That's true but however it doesn't bother me as much as this kind of manipulation is 'visible' by looking at the photography."
