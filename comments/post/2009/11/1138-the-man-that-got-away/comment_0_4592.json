For once I am really interested in YOUR opinions, and I'd like to hear as many of them before I voice mine, and then I am not yet sure where I really stand anyway ðŸ˜„\n\nPaul, you stress your independence as a viewer. How does this match with the fact that you make your judgment depend upon what I disclose? Isn't there kind of a contradiction? I know, it's about \"photography\" vs \"photo illustration\", but where does this leave the actual work? Does this mean that the importance of a work as an artifact, is less than the importance of how it came into being?\n\nAnd I have another question: If - due to a disclosure from my side - you see an image as less of a \"photograph\", how does this influence your judgment about it as a \"photo illustration\"? Is it only about the word? Or is it less because it is a \"photo illustration\"? Are all \"photo illustrations\" less than \"photographs\"?"
