Is it only about the word? Or is it less because it is a “photo illustration”? Are all “photo illustrations” less than “photographs”? \"\n\nSo is there a hierarchy of artistic work...best if photographic, second best if photographic illustration, third best if a derivative of a photography such as work rendered as paintings, etc?  I hope not!\n\nI rather judge each work on it own artistic merits. 🙂"
