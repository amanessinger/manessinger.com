    "content": "As always, what any photographer does with his or her images is up to them.  No one else has any say in that whatsoever.\n\nOn the other hand, how I - as the viewer - respond to a given image is my business.  Once you put it out there to be viewed, the only vote that counts is mine.  The same \"rule\" applies to every other viewer.  It's a very personal thing.\n\nHaving stated both disclaimers, I would add that knowing you had \"manipulated\" an image would almost certainly affect my response.  Negatively.  It might depend on the degree of manipulation, but if you tell me that you've added people that weren't actually there or changed backgrounds by adding a building or changing a cloudy sky to a sunny sky, then I definitely have a problem with that.  My personal definition of the word \"photograph\" is admittedly a very narrow one.  And adding or removing elements means that the original photograph has become some kind of \"photo illustration\".  It's no longer a photograph.  So that is how I'll judge it.\n\nSo yes, I'd want to know that you had created some kind of composite.  In fact, I'll go even further and say that I think the photographer, if they're honest, should disclose such information.  Some people won't care; others will.  But at least it's out there."
