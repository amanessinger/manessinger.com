None of my other lenses do it.  When it happened a few weeks ago, I did the old switch-a-roo and it didn't work. The camera had gone haywire.  Hopefully it's not a D300 thing!  My D300 was repaired for $225 and is in tip-top shape now.\n\nThe image is a very inviting night image, almost a dream scape. I see you managed to work in a bicycle, too. ðŸ™‚"
