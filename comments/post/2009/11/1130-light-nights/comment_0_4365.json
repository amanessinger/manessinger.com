    "content": "Exactly the reasons I've never pursued this 28-300 AF lens issue with Tamron, except to mention it in relationship to the VC problem I was having. The issue, while very real in the fact that I know firsthand it sometimes doesn't autofocus, is also very elusive in that I haven't been able to find a way to cause it to happen or even to predict when it may happen.  Perhaps it is occurring only on a small subset of later generation Tamron lens with VC...some tolerance our lens are slightly beyond.   My lens now mainly sits on the shelf, unused. Good luck in your testing...I'll be following your results closely. I'm hoping you may find an answer for both of us. ;-)\n\nWonderful photo with this post!"
