    "content": "I had very bad auto-focus on a prime lens from Sigma too.  Especially in low light it's go haywire.  I know, it's not even the same manufacturer and far from similar lens characteristics to your 17-50.  Plus it's a Canon mount.  But the one thing they have in common is having to reverse engineer the lens mounts, including the AF drive on both Nikon and Canon cameras.  It could very well be some quirk in the Nikon or Canon firmware on a particular camera that the lens manufacturers didn't account for; a new, weird response from the camera that causes things to go haywire.  Turn it off and back on, and voila, things are resolved.  It's akin to the blue screen of death and the infamous \"try rebooting\" as a first measure of fixing problems on a Windows box.\n\nI concur with others that this is a very good photo.  And I remember the church/cathedral in the background from my visit to Vienna."
