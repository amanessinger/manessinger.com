My time is worth more than the cost of the guy who cuts it really well. I have a guy who does my taxes. Same reason. I want to spend my spare time working on my images and writing, or reading DEEEEEP thoughts ðŸ™‚ And yet if I could find a way to combine my images with my words into illios on a sight that allowed easy grouping and spontaneous access from thumbnails.... Ahhhh... yes... I&#39;ve often thought about my own website.... Hmmmm.... <br /><br />I am really anxious to see what you come up with. Good luck. It&#39;s about time that a prolific and talented photographic visual artist designed one the rest of us can appreciate."
