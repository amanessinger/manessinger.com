But first off I figger that you so completely own the subject that it is off limits to every other artist. But secondly, the few times I&#39;ve tried to create something with them, I&#39;ve totally failed. You make them into such emotionally charged still lifes... and so seemingly easily... But DAMNIT you are showing off! It is NOT easy to find so much metaphorical music from these twisted pieces of metal and rubber. <br /><br />On the other hand... keep showing off...
