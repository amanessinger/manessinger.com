Flexibility is not so much a strong point, but for a blogging purposes again good enough. And the not completely easy feelings I have with google regarding their omnipresence and the reunification of personal traces left everywhere on the web is probably only a very personal thing. <br /><br />So I am looking forward to your new website."
