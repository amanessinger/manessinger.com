I guess I make something wrong in my vacations ðŸ™‚<br /><br />Yup!, it&#39;s like state hopping in the US, but on the other hand, and Poland has shown this to me agan, a single country, even a small one like Austria, would be enough to fulfill any photographer&#39;s life. In other words: it&#39;s not the location, it&#39;s what you&#39;re able to make of it. Yes, I&#39;ve made my Images of the Day in Poland, but it was in no way easier than in Vienna or Carinthia, and if at all, the opposite is true."
