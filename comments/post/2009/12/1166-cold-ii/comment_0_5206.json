    "content": "I had a similar problem with my D300 and Tamron 18-270 when I first got it. It had nothing to do with the cold, in fact, it was quite warm. However, intermittently, the camera wouldn't recognize the lens. I'd have to torque it a little bit to make sure that it was in place. Eventually, I cleaned the contacts on the lens and the camera. That seemed to make the problems go away.  I've kept my camera in the car when it has been 25 degrees F outside (-4 C) and then picked it up and used it outside for an hour or two with no problems, though."
