    "content": "I guess photography is also more than seeing. In a book about street photography there was an interesting chapter about rhythm - of walking. If you change your rhythm - from slow walk to normal walk to running to standing - it stresses you, and then you are no longer relaxed, in the flow zone, and it is hard to see and take photographs. So in that sense at least it needs a whole-body effort to take photographs.\n\nAnd I like the path."
