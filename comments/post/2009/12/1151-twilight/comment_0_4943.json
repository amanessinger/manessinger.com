I do it after the fact, but I still prefer to let intuition decide if a photo is good or bad.  \n\nWhat stood out to me in your write up is comparing seeing to the game Go.  I feel it makes sense.  While playing Go, especially  during the opening, you can choose a candidate move by intuition-- by how it looks.  Before playing it, it is good to analyze it before choosing it as your move.  Its like capturing photos based on feel, and then analyzing them when you choose your selects."
