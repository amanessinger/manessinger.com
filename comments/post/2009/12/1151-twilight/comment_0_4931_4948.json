There is definitely an improvement, and I guess it is connected to how much photography has become integrated into everything that I do. Going out without my camera makes me feel, well, not naked, rather insufficiently prepared for whatever may happen. Thus I never leave the house without the camera in my right hand, lens cap removed. Sounds crazy, huh? Well, most probably it is, but this constant readiness also fosters constant awareness.\n\nYup, it positively sounds crazy, but I don't mind ðŸ˜„"
