Not because it is just a simple, not too tedious work, no, to the contrary, it's because it is a way of artistic expression. If you don't stop at an arbitrarily drawn line (e.g. \"nothing that could not have been done in the darkroom\"), there is an infinite number of things that you can do after the fact, and by this, \"after the fact\" becomes \"part of the fact\".
