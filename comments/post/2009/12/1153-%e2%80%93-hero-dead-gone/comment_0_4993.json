Mixing end of year work/writing and gym training into a numbing cocktail. Still it leaves me with a nice little rush this time of the evening and that's just the right touch of euphoria to enjoy your bike pix. Until someone tries to do what you do with these things they cannot really appreciate your genius. I guess it's the difference between watching professional sports and playing?\n\nBTW... someone recently wondered if it is the photographer or the post-processor who brings more to the final image. No, in fact they argued that it is the pp which has become the major point of artistic entry into our process today. Thoughts?"
