If it were hanging on my wall, I don't think I'd get tired of it for a long long time.\n\nLike, Emma, I too remember bird ornaments like these. They have real bird feathers - probably chicken - for tails. But eventually the feathers would get broken or fall out.\n\nI'm sorry to hear your weather is nothing but rain, rain and more rain. I hope it either clears - or snows, for you."
