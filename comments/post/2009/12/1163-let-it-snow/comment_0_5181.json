For all that you moan about the gray days of winter, you capture some of the most beautiful winter scenes I've ever seen. ðŸ™‚\n\nNo \"tilt\", and  yet everything is angled in this brilliant composition. Love the splashes of color in the snowy white and gray; very real, yet playful.\n\nThank you for the tip about trying a flash! Now squirreled away somewhere in my brain, hopefully to be found again when needed."
