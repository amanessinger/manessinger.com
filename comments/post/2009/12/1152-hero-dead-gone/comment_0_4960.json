    "content": "That's the interesting thing about photography and photographers. Here, there is no context, only a damaged bicycle. Could it have been an angry girlfriend? An angry boyfriend?  Some group of kids that just decided to be 'cool' and do some random act of vandalism because they were caught up in group-think and didn't have the courage to _not_ do it.  There are lots and lots of possibilities. Could the guy or girl who parked the bicycle there been on a phone call that upset them and in a fit of rage damaged their own bicycle?  Who knows.\n\nI could probably come up with several more possible scenarios, of which all of them could be flawed. ðŸ™‚  A great photo to start a discussion or from which to spin a story or a blog post, which you've done admirably."
