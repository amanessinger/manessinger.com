(actually - it s a lovely site - love the clean lines, the black and various whites &amp; greys as contrast )...  \n\nI often take shots from the hip ... walking along and shooting (like the monkey) and it is true i have to delete 99% of them but occasionally i get a shot that i love; that makes me see differently and no way in the world would i normally have composed such a shot ...\n\nI had chosen to comment on your monkey posting because the first thought that came to my mind is 'some monkeys are highly intelligent!'\n\nAnother thing you said, stays with me .... (it made me smile and nod - as i know how you feel) .. you said 'Iâ€™m neither creative nor productive at the moment. Iâ€™m not even polite. \"    .... thanks for my late night smile\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR and may 2010 bring you many many wonderful moments of creativity, productivity and joy (politeness is optional) ... ðŸ™‚   &gt;&gt;&gt; Gina"
