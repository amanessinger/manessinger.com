I didn't finish the main quest, but I ended up very rich and powerful, with a beautiful house of my own, complete collections of all armor and weapons, a rich collection of books, neatly displayed, a first class alchemy lab, you get it ðŸ˜„\n\nIn the end I stopped playing and began modding. I liked my house, but I wanted it in another place, and I wanted to acquire it through an extensive quest, along with my own teleportation network, backed by a story as well. Oh dear, let's say it got slightly out of control ðŸ™‚\n\nStill, neither then nor now did I grow tired of the music. It's magic."
