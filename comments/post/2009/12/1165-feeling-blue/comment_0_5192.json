They have a big success rate but I daresay that since most of the taggers are underage it's become a game of cat and mouse for them. I actually don't mind tagging or graffiti for that matter though I prefer not to see it done on private property like people's fences or homes. Some of the graffiti we have here can be wonderfully artistic and often adds colour to otherwise dull and characterless areas. As for the tagging, well at times I am just amazed at the places you find them and wonder how in the world they managed to get there. I don't deny that tagging and graffiti can be seen as willful damage to property but the people who do it do it for particular reasons and if local governments really wanted to stop it then they need to be looking at those reasons and perhaps spend their money and energy on fixing those. In the meantime I'll just keep viewing it as a distraction from the mundane.\nSorry... didn't mean to go on for so long."
