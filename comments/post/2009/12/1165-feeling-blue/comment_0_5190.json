That warm light does wonders for the photo.  \n\nAs for that annoyance, in English, collectively, they are called graffiti, but the individual signatures, if you will, are called tags. When you go to the larger cities, particularly New York and Philadelphia, you see lots and lots of tagging. It got so bad in NY that they developed and started using graffiti resistant/proof outer shells on the subway cars. Now they are nice and clean. The so-called graffiti artists then moved on to freight trains. It's hard to see a boxcar without a tag."
