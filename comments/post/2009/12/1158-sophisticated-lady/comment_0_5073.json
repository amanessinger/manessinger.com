I too would love to know which software you used - perhaps a combination of two or more.\n\nWhat strikes me most is how those lights in the distance look so much like pearls that could be a necklace that any woman would be happy to wear. It's like the mannequin has hung up her pearls in favor of what she was wearing when you made the image. Or perhaps a store just dangled the pearls outside to entice people to stop, admire and go inside to buy something."
