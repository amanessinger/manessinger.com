    "content": "\"A bright, cold winter day with fresh snow...\" \n\nIndeed, \"bright\" is the key term here. Here in Finland we have cold, we have snow, but no brightness. Yesterday we got well over 20 cm of snow, today perhaps 10 cm more, and it doesn't seem to be stopping there. Snowfall all the time.\n\nLucky you! I liked especially the photographs of snow/ice covered shore.\n\n(On the other hand, if we wouldn't have the snow and the cold, it would be ever worse.)"
