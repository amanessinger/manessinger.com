    "content": "Certainly the one lens, one camera approach is certainly not a panacea, a cure all. It's just another way of simplifying. Steve's approach, having a single zoom is along the same lines. What I was talking about, as I'm sure you know, was in having so many lenses as to make decisions difficult, thereby getting in the way of the photography.\n\nIt's funny, you were a partial inspiration for the prime lens.
