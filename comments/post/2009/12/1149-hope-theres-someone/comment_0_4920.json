    "content": "Thanks all. Yes, although these are Saturday's images, I have posted the entry only hours ago. Insofar I am quite surprised to already find answers. Thanks again ðŸ™‚\n\nAs far as forums go, I have stopped visiting them. It consumes too much time. The only forum that I participate in at the moment, is the <a href=\"http://photo.net/nikon-camera-forum/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nikon forum</a> at Photo.net. I like that place for its non-fanboy attitude and because they have a nice mix of beginners and experts. I wouldn't be there though, were it not for the fact that you can subscribe to the forum via RSS. Actually, feeds are my almost exclusive way to keep connected nowadays. The problem is, the forums at TME have no feeds. You can't simply subscribe to them in Google Reader and get updated when something is posted. You have to actively go there."
