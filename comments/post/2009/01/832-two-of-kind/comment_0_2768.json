I take a lot of photos of trees, and try but often fail to avoid using the same framing etc. <br/><br/>But here you decide on the composition, and then look at different subjects with this viewpoint. Would it be possible to do this on a meta-level - photograph people like trees, or trees like people, cars like bicycles, mountains like flowers, etc. Probably not I guess."
