That is what makes art universal, to transcend all cultures and be independent of language. <br/>Your thoughts on composition are interesting and something to ponder. I do not see similar patterns in my own photography but perhaps I haven't been looking for it.<br/>I also like the point made by Juha Haataja. To photograph people like trees... interesting.<br/>Kind Regards."
