    "content": "\"Hobsonesque\"?  OMG, we're creating a monster here!<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't think Andreas' image here is all that \"Hobsonesque\".  While there are certain elements that are similar, the basic style is fundamentally different (in my opinion).  I think Mark would freely admit that a key ingredient in his images is a sense of chaos.  I think he consciously avoids compositions that are \"balanced\".  I've noticed that the photographs he posts that I like are the ones that break this rule - that, is they tend to have an element of visual balance.<br/><br/>Andreas, on the other hand (again, this is just my opinion), tends to post images that are not chaotic.  He may have the horizon line slightly out of kilter - as in this case - but looking at the image doesn't leave you with the feeling that something's \"missing\"."
