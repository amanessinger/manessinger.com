    "content": "Great series of images.  The image of the day really did grab me as it scrolled onto my screen and I spent a considerable amount of time in there poking about, looking at all the details.<br/><br/>I do like your take on the poster and yes, I have also thought about the implications of photographing other peoples' art and then posting it as a photograph which I, in turn, present as my own work. This dilemma was nagging me every time I photographed an image for the graffiti series I did some time ago.  In the end, I rationalized that the work was, after all, in a public space so it was free for the taking.  I have no idea what the laws are here regarding this however and I admit I'd be a little nervous about selling a photo of someone else's art."
