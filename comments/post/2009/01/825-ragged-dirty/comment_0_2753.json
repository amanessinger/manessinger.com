Sigh...\"<br/><br/>It's beyond charmimg I guess because the way that humans have soiled the walls is similar to garbage and well, you've packaged the dirty wall with packaged dirt. But... what I find really interesting is that the trash actually is so well ordered that it shows the trash makers care to make things better, while the graff painters purposely want to make things worse. Great juxtaposition Andreas.<br/><br/>Now for the others...<br/><br/>Your slushy street scene shows a very difficult accomplishment for an artist. I am reading a book on neuro science. The author says that the brain is a lazy piece of meat and in trying to save effort it purposely blanks out the every-day. In fact we must force it to see the most familiar commonplace around us. And here you've done that in a way that drops me onto a story arc. Especially since what is commonplace to you, isn't to your visitors. Cool!<br/><br/>Actually four is showing off. It lets us see just how technically impressive image three is. As usual you've pulled off a seamless fantasy by turning the poster into a fierce urban warrior. And that of course makes us explain what the hell that juxtaposition of stuff is doing all in one place. Wonder is wonderful.<br/><br/>As for image five. Darn, I don't get it. But that's just me and what do I know?"
