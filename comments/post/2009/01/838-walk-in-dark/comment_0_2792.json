The wall to the left is yellow, the woman wears a red coat, the light in the background is from a construction site and is strongly greenish-white, the other street lights are orange, but along with the strong contrast it did not work that well.<br/><br/>Then I tried a B&amp;W adjustment layer with setting &quot;Maximum Black&quot;, which here is equivalent to a strong blue filter, and that gave me a completely different, darkly sinister mood. I liked it and kept to that."
