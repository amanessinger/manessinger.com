You should return to it and labor and sweat and do all of your magic to make the dynamic range... rage! That ocean of fog that is about to drown the tree line is awesome. I have seen only a very few images in my life that have such potential power to stun viewers than this. National Geographic would go NUTZ to have a photographer who could capture this sort of magical awesomeness from a vista. <br/><br/>You reeeeeeely should revisit this to make that cloud bank sreach Andreas. This should be one of those images which people will always associate with your talent. <br/><br/>On the other hand... wuhdoIknow?<br/><br/>Have a good weekend... <br/><br/>Ted"
