I have barely begun to scratch the surface of what the D80 can do, and plan to use it until it dies. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Thank you for the insight into your wonderful, low noise, photos. I will try setting the ISO up high and shooting B&amp;W. <br/>I really prefer B&amp;W to color, and sometimes I really like the grain/noise in a B&amp;W photo. It gives it personality, texture...life.<br/><br/>Great photos, I am so glad I stumbled on your blog!"
