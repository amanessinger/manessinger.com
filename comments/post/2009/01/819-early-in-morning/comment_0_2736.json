    "content": "A great question, Andreas, and for me it kind of depends on the season.  Going out in the winter in the morning (before dawn) is tough.  I mean, who wants to get their nose frozen 15 minutes after waking up?  Generally speaking, it's always colder at dawn than at five in the afternoon.<br/><br/>But I like morning light better.  It's also always less crowded - most people are not early risers.<br/><br/>So it's one of those \"six of one, half a dozen of the other\" things, I guess.  Of course, around here (western NY), morning light is pretty drab 99% of the time.  It's either cloudy or cloudy or cloudy....well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>Thanks for the daily images, especially those from up in the mountains.  I honestly don't know how you manage to find the time."
