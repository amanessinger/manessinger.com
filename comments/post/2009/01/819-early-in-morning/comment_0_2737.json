Having said that I don't actually take many photos this time of year for the same reasons as mentioned by Paul.  With daytime temperatures hovering around -20-30C I tend not to go outside unless I have to.  Winter photography for me means processing and printing the photos taken during the other half of the year.<br/><br/>I have your blog bookmarked in my feed reader and always look forward to your posts.  Thanks Andreas."
