    "content": "Thanks. Yes, days are short, and I dislike even our daylight times. No hate, but I'd prefer days being longer. I envy you for your summer times though. Just another \"six of one, half a dozen of the other\" thing, as Paul puts it. On the other hand, there is hardly a chance to miss twilight ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>How I manage to find the time? No kids and an unhealthy dose of obsession, I suppose ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>-30C?? Eeek!! Well, when I was on the mountain lately for a sunset, it may have been -15, but with some good wind. I suppose that comes near, at least subjectively. I took off one glove for fiddling the cable release into its socket, and this definitely hurt.<br/><br/>As to the light: the street scene comes near, though it's certainly more vibrant, and the light on the bicycle image is completely constructed. This was in deep, solid shade, flat as the Netherlands and much less colorful ðŸ™‚ It's ISO 3200 at f4 and 1/15s. The shadow is from some street light or from light out of a window. Hmm ... in hindsight, I could have made it less blue ðŸ™‚"
