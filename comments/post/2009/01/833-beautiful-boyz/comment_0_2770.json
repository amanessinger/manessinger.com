    "content": "Your remarks on science fiction were rather interesting. During the last few years I have slowly lost interest in the genre. I feel that our society has become a scientific society in such a manner as make science fiction mostly obsolete in the popular meaning. <br/><br/>Your observations on thinking about science fiction books (Gibson et al.) as \"alternate reality\" are one way of coping with this change. <br/><br/>Only certain authors - in whose work the science is only a pretext for discussion - still have some interest. But I keep hoping that the genre reinvents itself and once again becomes interesting.<br/><br/>A recent exception was \"The Android's Dream\" by John Scalzi. In a way the book is an extended science fiction joke (making fun of a lot of previously written story lines), but still I liked it. Perhaps it is a bit like dancing around the corpse of science fiction, though."
