On the cover was a picture of a water tap. One of the men said that they wanted to discuss how water will run out in the world - a science fiction theme if any.<br/><br/>When Jehovah's Witnesses are starting to use science fiction themes I guess we are quite far advanced in the scientific society.<br/><br/>As to the reason for the downfall of science fiction and rise of fantasy - escapism is certainly one possible explanation. Another such escape mechanism might be computer games, where you can disappear in artificial worlds, many of which are built around science fiction themes."
