    "content": "Obviously the real question seems to be: What is the reason for the demise of science fiction? Gibson's reply is nonsense. Nothing has changed at all. Of course we could imagine futures just as we did 30, 40 years before, of course all the techniques of interpolation would be readily available, now just as they were, but the question is, why don't we use them?<br/><br/>It's not that science fiction is not written any more. LeGuin's last Hainish novel, \"The Telling\", is from 2000, and it's a fantastic book, though probably not typical science fiction, but that's true for most of her work. I also just read Mary Doria Russell's \"The Sparrow\" and \"Children of God\", written in 1996 and 1998. Science fiction, yes, but more the anthropological and philosophical branch ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I guess the real problem is the downfall of positivism along with the realization that science not only solved many of our problems, but created a big bunch of them as well. When I began reading sci fi and fantasy in the 1970s, fantasy was the little brother and sci fi ruled the bookstores, at least in Austria. In the meantime it has tipped, fantasy takes a much bigger part now, along with a general trend into escapism and the esoteric.<br/><br/>Basically there are two kinds of science fiction: the utopian \"positive\" science fiction and the apocalyptic negative variant. The positive is probably coupled to strong ideals and a general feeling of direction, and the negative, well, people may have lost their interest in apocalypses after 9/11 and how the Bush government handled the situation."
