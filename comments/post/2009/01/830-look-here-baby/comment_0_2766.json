    "content": "I have marveled at these lights in past images of your beloved bicycles, not so much at the lights themselves but the fact that they are still used in Austria.  When I was a kid, way back when, these were the only lights that existed on bicycles.  But I haven't seen one in decades.  Now it's all cheap, tiny, plastic, battery driven strobe effect lights with no style at all.  All with discardable batteries that end up in land fill sites where they leach into the ground and water.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, one seldom sees a bicycle that's more than a decade or so old unlike many of the bicycles you've captured here.<br/><br/>I wonder, does this say something about  North Americans' readiness, no, eagerness to discard the old for the new, not because it's better but simply because it's new?  Are Europeans less caught up in the rampant consumerism that plagues this part of the world?  Kind of gives new meaning to the term \"New World\" doesn't it?"
