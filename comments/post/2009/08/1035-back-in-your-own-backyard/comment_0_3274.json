    "content": "Thanks. As to the passports, well, of course you&#39;re right. It IS a problem. All those electronic gadgets are. There is no guarantee that they don&#39;t fail at any moment. My banking cards seem to fail once a year, without me doing anything but carrying them around and using them every few days.<br /><br />The problem is, that a failing card could as well just give faulty information, and people tend to believe what computers say, sometimes against all evidence. Now, when the only evidence is a card that says you are Osama Bin Laden, they will probably shoot you first and then check if you really are who the card says you are. Pretty easy to make a Buttle a Tuttle.<br /><br />Of course the matter is only complicated by an industry that wants to sell those things and short-sighted politicians who want to believe that those gadgets save the world and their re-election."
