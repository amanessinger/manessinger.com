Actually we live in a culture where every idiot believes he has to do it, regardless of how ridiculous it is to even think of a loss that they could suffer. <br /><br />If I&#39;m doing it for my family album, then there is obviously no loss. If I do it for my blog, well, what is it but cheap advertising? If I do it to make art and sell it, well, art is out of their business anyway. Leaves stock. OK, why not only disallow that if anything?<br /><br />The problem is, that we live in a culture of greed instead of sharing. There are exceptions, for example in the free software world, but by and large it&#39;s all about lawyers and greed."
