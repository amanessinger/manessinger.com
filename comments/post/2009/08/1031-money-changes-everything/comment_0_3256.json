Simply because the behaviour of photographers is often simply ignorant and impertinent. Talk for example about high-powered flashes during theater performances (or a circus!) or standing up and moving around between the seats during Beethovens 4th symphony (I almost strangled the guy). And so on...<br /><br />As a consequence, a lot of places have completely barred photography. And - although I sometimes wish I could take some photos - in general I&#39;m thankful for that."
