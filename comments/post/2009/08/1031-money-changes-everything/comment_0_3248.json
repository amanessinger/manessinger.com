But I think many museums and historically interesting churches practises a more liberate view on this, when simply not allowing flash (this might also be due to possible damages, I guess). Without extra light, you&#39;re unlikely to produce high quality pictures in a circus, not from the seat anyway. But, who knows, the ISO12800 digitals might do the trick... Better stay future proof and prohibit it all. ðŸ™‚"
