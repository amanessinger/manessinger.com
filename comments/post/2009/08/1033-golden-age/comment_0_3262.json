Well, I used pretty heavy post-processing for two reasons: In the original the sky and the reflection were pretty much apart tonally, but I wanted the architecture to almost float in the sky. Thus I had to darken the sky and to push the reflections. The second reason is a direct consequence, because now there was visibly more noise in the reflection than in the sky. The painting effect nicely took care of that ðŸ™‚"
