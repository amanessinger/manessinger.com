I even forgot my card reader, thus I can&#39;t post an image tonight ðŸ™‚<br /><br />I&#39;ll think about a post where I explain in detail what I currently use most of the time. This image would be especially interesting, because it surprised even me, and the reason was the surprising effect that one of the Topaz Detail presets had. I&#39;ll think about it."
