And, any others I may  think of later. If I were a photojournalist, I would be concerned about being true to what I saw. But, since I&#39;m not a journalist, I am not the least bit concerned with whether someone doubts that I saw those colors, or cloned something out, or any other darn thing. <br /><br />Wow!
