    "content": "Of course, as some know, I would never use adjustment layers and post only virgin images directly from my flash card considering anything other than PreProcessing to be less than photography. <br /><br />However... and seriously... about saturation. As we build up the layers the intensity of saturation tends to erupt. And yet in multi layers it happens in ways such  that our eye grows immune to the effect. I have taken to actually leaving an image I thought was finished for at least fifteen minutes to allow myself to appreciate what&#39;s happened to the tonal mapping and the relative dynamic range of the palette of my images. <br /><br />How do you handle the fact that the eye fatigues with respect to informing the mind about the intensity of dominant chromes so that they do not steal the attention away from the larger idea and feeling of an image?"
