That&#39;s ridiculous. We can&#39;t capture it with our cameras, and if we could, we couldn&#39;t display it on our monitors, we have to map it into the possible range. Sure, there are scenes that call for subtlety, but this is none of them ðŸ™‚<br /><br />On the other hand, I had to let <a href=\"http://manessinger.com/2009/08/1039-blinding.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">today&#39;s image</a> rest until the evening. In the morning the light from outside (in Vienna the living room with the computer faces east) was too intense, and even though I closed the curtains, I could not judge the image, and doing it by histogram alone would not have sufficed. In fact I really made changes in the evening."
