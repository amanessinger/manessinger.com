Had I made this image in color, I probably would have used a Snap Art painting filter to add drama and at the same time to create distance from reality. <br /><br />In b+w I could stretch contrasts to the extreme. Had I done the same in color, it would have looked much less ... I don&#39;t know ... real? <br /><br />Use an unnatural representation to make it look more real? Yes, I think sometimes it works just that way. It&#39;s probably not more than 150 years of conditioning by photographic history.<br /><br />Anyway. This image went b+w and at any other day I would probably have used color. There is much randomness in my process. That keeps it interesting for me ðŸ™‚"
