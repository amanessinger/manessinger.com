LOL Yes, I too like your opening image a lot, but have a hard time \"seeing\" Spring in it.<br/><br/>I most wanted to comment on your second image, the morning view out your window in Vienna.  I think you really captured the \"feel\" of the morning light and of what you see out that window in the early mornings.  I struggle with this all the time in my photography, to make an image that reflects what I saw and \"felt\" (maybe most important of all?) when I was there in person looking at a particular scene.  I have two or three special places outdoors that I keep returning to and keep taking pictures of, trying to capture what I see and feel.  Some work a lot better than others!  Very nice work on your morning view though.<br/><br/>Rod"
