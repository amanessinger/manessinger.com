And that may be about as far from spring as one can get.  The subject matter  is fine but the colour treatment gives it a more somber appearance.  Your third image however, the one with the white flowers, now that fits my idea of spring.   Anyway, maybe I'm totally out to lunch on this one but I couldn't help commenting.<br/><br/>I really do like the results you've been getting with the lens/software combination."
