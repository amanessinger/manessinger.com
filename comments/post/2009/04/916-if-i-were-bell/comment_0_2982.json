But given the potency of the lens with that lead image... well it has the ability to create texture that I could file my nails upon. Gotta admit that the street scene  has a tad less contrast than I'd prefer. I rarely comment on the technical and apologize for doing it here... but since your content as usual sings... I was distracted in the street and flower shots by a softness in the lens contrast.... which seems absent in your intriguing handlebar capture."
