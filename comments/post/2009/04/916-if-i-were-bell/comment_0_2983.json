I've included them for a mood.<br /><br />I also see what you mean with the street scene. I have just tried what it looks like with more contrast on the low end and a slight push in the mids ... but I don't like it. <br /><br />It's interesting. The image as uploaded is very similar to what came out of the camera. It already has more contrast on the low end and slightly opened up mids, but it is identical in the mood. Opening it up further crosses a certain threshold, and suddenly it may even be a better image, but it is not the image that I was after. It has a different mood. Funny what sometimes constitutes an image in our minds, huh?"
