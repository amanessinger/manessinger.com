    "content": "How odd. is this thing called a Durchhaus. As I looked at in your marvelous image of the durchhaus they seemed entirely normal. Then I read your description and went through my mental inventory. \"Hmmm, self...\" I said to myself, \"Where have you seen these archways cutting directly through houses that allowed for public thoroughfares?\" <br /><br />At first I thought of alleyways cut between row homes. Those we have a lot of here in Lancaster. But they are private ways open only two the two houses which meet above them on the upper floors. \"Curious,\" I thought to myself, \"surely you have seen these thing or you would have marveled at them in Andreas's post. But where have  I seen them?\"<br /><br />And I had no answer in my memory inventory. Perhaps as I grew up in PHiladelphia? When I worked in Baltimore, DC, New York or Boston? Maybe it is a big city thing here? This is gnawing at me now Andreas. Yes, private passageways like these which enter into courts or rear yards... they are not unusual in older buildings. But ... but... wait. We do have air-walks between buildings that form arches over narrow streets... and even larger ones. However it's those narrow streets which flow under those airwalks... perhaps... those are why this idea seems so normal? Or at least not... foreign?<br /><br />Durchhaus... a wonderful word. I shall memorize it and try to find an image for which it will make the perfect caption. Although, I cannot imagine finding one with more mystery, or wonder-filled presence thatn you have here. This is one of your traffic-stopping images Andreas. Luvvvit!"
