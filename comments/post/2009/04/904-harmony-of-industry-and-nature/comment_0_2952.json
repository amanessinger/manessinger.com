    "content": "First: the funny thing is, that the \"Harmony\" title was only one way to go, the other strong association was that of an industrial castle. It's something about the place. It's majestic.<br/><br/>Sure, it is a place where they surface mine gravel, but from afar you could take it for ramparts and towers.<br/><br/>Second: much of the industrial buildings of the past has been abolished and the sites have become centers of our cities. It's the quarries that remain, and of course some solitary examples like the Arsenal in Venice, but Venice has simply been put under a glass dome when its power ended in the Napoleonic wars and it was suddenly transformed into the first big theme park."
