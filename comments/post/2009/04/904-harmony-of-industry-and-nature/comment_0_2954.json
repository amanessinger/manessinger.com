    "content": "Southern France is such a case. In high medieval times this was a rich land, actually richer than the north. They were not fully, but almost independent, the Duke of Toulouse one of the most powerful men in all Christianity. This lasted until the crusade against the so-called heresy of the Albigenses. Countless people died, the south was politically crushed ... and it never recovered. <br/><br/>When you want to see the most wonderful Romanesque architecture: Aquitaine is the place. Gothic? Some samples, and you see, it's the typical architecture of an occupying force. The Cathedral of Albi actually looks much more like a fortress than like a church.<br/><br/>And then nothing. No Renaissance, no Baroque. There was no more money, no more independent spirit."
