But tomorrow, you will post the ruins of a castle, and today you post the presence of employment and income producing power which the ancient world could hardly imagine. <br/><br/>And it makes me wonder (which is a wonderful component of your art)... this time about ruins versus now. Time has a way of sanding down and decaying what was so that the rough edges all melt off leaving us with a pile of romantic stuff. <br/><br/>Surely the ancients had their production plants. They had their assembly plants. They had their cart makers, coopers, mass producers of textiles, and the like. Yet what remains are all generally lovely in comparison to a lot of our presence. Hmmmmm.... surely they had their ghettos, tenements, sawmills, and road houses? <br/><br/>What's become of the stripper palaces? The warehouses? Were they all made of wood that long ago became food for worms, bugs, and bacteria? If you'd happened upon a larger employer's place of work... say back in the 1400s.... would you have found any scenes as pleasant as this? Were the good old days... all that good? <br/><br/>Hmmmmmm......"
