In this country the economic tides crested back in 1929 and then receded from many towns and small cities which never recovered but remained sufficiently populated by increasingly poor people who kept them minimally maintained and preserved within a patina of poverty. <br/><br/>As you pass through these places you can see the ambition and visions they left as sort of negatives in their buildings. Hmmmm.... no, let me try that differently... You know the lost wax method that they use to cast bronzes? In a way it's as if the almost-ruins were left after the wax of the culture and affluence was consumed. These were muscular structures fitted with facades of their ambitious dreams. <br/><br/>As an economist I frequently think about the fickleness of economic nutrients. And I imagine a coupe of retired legionnaires, sitting along the crumbling Apian Way wondering when repair crews were next scheduled to come by."
