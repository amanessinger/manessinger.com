Never thought of that before but I see where you're coming from.  <br/>Sorry to disappoint but I won't be seeing Leonard Cohen when he's here later this month.  I might have but Neil Young is here on April 15 and considering the cost of concert tickets, just shy of $400 for two,  well, it really was a no brainer. <br/><br/>Also, the Cohen concert in London, the other one, was aired on tv last night so I had a front row seat and the price was right."
