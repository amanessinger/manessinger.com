    "content": "Regarding local contrast: Lightroom and Camera Raw have sliders for local contrast.  They call it \"Clarity\" in Lightroom.  Sliding it to the right increases the local contrast (going too far can create halos just like in Photomatix), and to the left decreases it to create a sort of foggy look."
