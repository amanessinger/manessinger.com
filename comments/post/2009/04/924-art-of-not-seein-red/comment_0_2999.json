    "content": "Thanks. Unfortunately, after I had seen it on a real monitor, I had to go back and give the image a little more punch in the blacks. I have changed it to the new version and mentioned the change in the text. Sorry for that.<br /><br />As to clarity, it's exactly this tendency to produce halos, that I don't like and why I use a different tool that specializes in local contrast modifications. Seinberg, you're right, Photomatix can produce similar halos, but there you can control it with the degree of light smoothing. Set it to 100% and you get less HDR effect and no halos. Essential HDR is better in that regard. But anyway, the lightweight specialist PhotoLift is my favorite for that."
