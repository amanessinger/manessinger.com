It is not quite surreal where the 'facts' which the artist presents cannot be connected into a whole. <br/><br/>As you know I am discomforted by photographic artists who promote, romanticize or who mawkishly transform the self-indulgence of <b>graffiti</b> into some ideological critique of property rights, or ideology.  HOWEVER.... to acknowledge <b>its</b> presence as an undeniable reality of urban life, and to fit it into that fabric is a powerful and important challenge. And you have gone farther here by balancing the graff's anonymous intrusion against the faceless presence of person. <br/><br/>Which makes me wonder about just what identity is in a city. Here you show the ambiguous ranting as sharply focused and the human as identity-less. And it is all in the light of day. <br/><br/>I'm forced to wonder about what is more important and you have given me DOF signals which wrestle with my human and individualistic instincts. Is this a statement about collectivism? Is it a conclusion about individualism? Is it about the loss of social control? Is it about ... about... the idrection of cities? The fact of cities in the 21st centuries where a present culture swirls about the leavings of its ancestors? <br/><br/>Yeah... this is powerful Andreas."
