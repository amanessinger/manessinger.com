    "content": "This is powerful. It is not quite surreal where the 'facts' which the artist presents cannot be connected into a whole. While I am discomforted by photographic artists who romanticize or who mawkishly transform them into some ideological argument over property rights, or ideology. <br/><br/>HOWEVER.... to acknowledge their presence as an undeniable reality of urban life, and to fit them into that fabric is a powerful challenge. And you have gone farther here by balancing their anonymous intrusion against the faceless presence of person. <br/><br/>Which makes me wonder about just what identity is n a city. Here you show the ambiguous ranting as sharply focused, they human as identityless. And it is all in the light of day. <br/><br/>I'm forced to wonder about what is more important and you have given me DOF signals which wrestle with my human and individualistic instincts. Is this a statement about collectivism? Is it a conclusion about individualism? Is it about the loss of social control? Is it about ... about... the idrection of cities? The fact of cities in the 21st centuries where a present culture swirls about the leavings of its ancestors? <br/><br/>Yeah... this is powerful Andreas."
