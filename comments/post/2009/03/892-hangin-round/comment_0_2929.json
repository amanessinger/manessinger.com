    "content": "Here in Finland we haven't had too much trouble with paranoid attitudes towards photographers, but some things are open for debate, for example the definition of \"public place\". <br/><br/>Currently, shops, shopping malls etc. are public places, but this is not always understood or known by the guards or salespeople. Thus I was forbidden to take photos (of colorful objects) in a shop recently. First time this happened to me."
