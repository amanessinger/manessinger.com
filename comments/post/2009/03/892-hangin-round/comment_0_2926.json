It's photographs of police officers and other security personnel that are the problem, not 'photographs in  public places'. <br/><br/>This is the BBC's summary:<br/><br/>It makes it an offence to \"elicit, publish or communicate information\" relating to members of the Armed Forces, intelligence services and police, which is \"likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism\".<br/><br/>More info here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7892273.stm<br/><br/>Haven't commented before, but I very much enjoy seeing your daily photos."
