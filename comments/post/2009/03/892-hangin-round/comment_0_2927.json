    "content": "Elizabeth, theoretically you are right, but in practice I have read (I believe in a comment to the article on The Online Photographer) about a photographer who got harassed and was forced to delete a couple of images made in a park. In the background, blurred and impossible to identify, were two police officers.<br/><br/>The problem is, that in street photography you never have the whole situation under control. Imagine you stand at a corner, the light is just right, you are photographing a rapidly changing scene, suddenly all comes together, people, cars, everything is in position, everything rhymes, everything is aligned, you know you have been lucky. It's one of those unrepeatable moments and ...<br/><br/>... suddenly a police officer tells you to delete the images that you just made. And really, there is a police officer in your masterpiece, not identifyable, out of focus indeed, but you you can't argue the officer being there.<br/><br/>What would you do?<br/><br/>Even worse: they talk about members of intelligence services. You won't even be able to recognize them beforehand, will you?<br/><br/>Theoretically you are right, in practice the terms are still so loosely defined, that the outcome depends on an arbitrary decision of an officer, not on a strictly defined law. <br/><br/>This kind of \"laws\" are typically found in totalitarian states. Their primary use is to keep everybody potentially guilty and therefore in constant fear.<br/><br/>No, there is no way out of it: this law is not compatible with the spirit of democracy."
