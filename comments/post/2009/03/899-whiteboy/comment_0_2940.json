It's a good thing that you have your bicycles to turn to.<br/><br/>I've been following your blog for a while and have question:  What is your fascination with bicycles? I remember asking a similar question of Paul Butzi and his gates.  He came up with an answer that was very interesting in that it was a curiousity as to why the gate was there. To keep people out? To keep something in?  Who put it there?  Is it still of use, etc?<br/><br/>So, I am very curious about your affection for bicycles."
