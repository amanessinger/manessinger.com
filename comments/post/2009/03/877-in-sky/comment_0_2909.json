For some things like Thursday's stairs in \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2009/03/874-something-new.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">874 - Something New</a>\", it is perfect, or just take \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/06/602-day-that-jackie-jumped-jail.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">602 - The Day That Jackie Jumped The Jail</a>\". That's one image that I'm proud of.<br/><br/>Let's just say that the fish does not fit too well into my usual routine of keeping lenses for weeks. I hope that changes now."
