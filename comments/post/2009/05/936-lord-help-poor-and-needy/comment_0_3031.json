But... but... but.. when we aim our lens out through the thing... well it does become its fetter. <br /><br />Dorthea Lang said that every picture she took was a self portrait. Hmmmmm.... Wonder what that says about fetters? <br /><br />Your self portraits are a poetic perspective on the world Andreas. The way you interact motif within theme is a long form discovery. It's interesting that your image-a-day has resulted in a new literary/visual genre. We've not had this kind of media in the past. And your exploration... particularly as you capture images almost on automatic... Is the very essence of wht blogging can contribute to the arts."
