    "content": "I agree with letting the camera catch images without fetters.  Deciding which photos to use later will likely result in the best possible finished project.  I have a \"set\" storyline which causes me no end of grief.  Text is a monster to wrestle with, indeed.  The photos are unplanned other than being some aspect of the Canadian prairie, the setting of the storyline.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing your final book."
