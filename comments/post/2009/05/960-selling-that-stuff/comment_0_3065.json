And why don't I do it? <br /><br />Because it's a hassle. You have to jump through loops if you ask them and they can sue you if you don't. I absolutely adore what Craig does, but that is different from how I work, and more important, from how my attention works. I see people, I see them do things, they get my attention through completely spontaneous actions. You can't repeat that. So far I was never interested in portraits, I was always interested in situations. They may happen or not, but if they do, the moment when I want to photograph the person, is always before I have had the chance to ask, and when I ask, they can't repeat what they did anyway. And even if they could, we would not stand in the same configuration, especially in respect to our environment. The light, the shadows, the lines, the passersby, all that would be different.<br /><br />I am not a people photographer yet. They don't interest me enough. That my change, but for now there are other things that hold my attention.<br /><br />On the other hand, Ted, among all his strands of genius, is a good people photographer, and he gets better and better at it. But then, they certainly interest him Â´ðŸ™‚"
