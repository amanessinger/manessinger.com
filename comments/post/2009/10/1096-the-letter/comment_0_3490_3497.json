    "content": "Actually, for my use the D3s would be fine, it's only that I'm not willing to spend the money. As I said, I'll wait. In two or three years that sensitivity will be the standard in my price range. If I'd follow every impulse, only because it would be useful, where should I stop? The 24 Mpx Nikon D3x would be useful as well, so would be the new Leica S2 or a Phase One 60 Mpx medium format back. Would I buy those? Sure, if I had money to burn, but that's something that I don't have. I have to make a stop, and if I have to, why not simply at what I already have?\n\nAfter all: isn't it silly to throw away a perfectly fine camera like the D300, a camera that has cost the price of a D300, after only almost two years? At not even a third of its shutter life? A camera that fulfills all my needs and most of my wishes? I guess it would be silly indeed ðŸ™‚"
