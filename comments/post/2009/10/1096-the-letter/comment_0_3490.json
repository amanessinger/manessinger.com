    "content": "ISO numbers are getting interesting. On TOP, they have a poll asking how much ISO do you shop for and most people came up with ISO 1600. I guess that I don't take many night shots so cannot see the usefulness of ISO 12,800, let alone, 104,000!  Also, having HD video inside of a still camera. I'm not sold. ðŸ™‚  I'm sure that it is useful for someone and that they'll sell a number of them, but I'm just as pleased as peaches with my D300, even though it's about 18 months old, which, in digital technology, is probably a dinosaur, or at least a relic!"
