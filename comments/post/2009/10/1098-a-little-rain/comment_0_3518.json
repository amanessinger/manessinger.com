    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply. It helps me : I never had the idea to look to other lenses than Nikon's. I'll rent the two lenses for a day or two and compare.\n\nI do like this picture. It is so real.  The mood of rainy days is well rendered. I like the precision of the rain's marks in the window contrasting with the \"flou\" of the backgrond. The colored main lights attract the eye and are emphasized by the V's lines (one  is a counterpoint V) . \nThe right part of the picture is s a nice abstract. \n\nEvery day I come to your site. See your new picture(s) on Monday.\n\nMicheline deJordy"
