The leaves here are mostly on the ground now, a beautiful sight in itself but nothing compared to what came before. \n\nI'll also take this opportunity to say that I am really enjoying your new site.  I am both impressed and grateful for the tremendous amount of effort you have put into it. We, your fans, are the obvious beneficiaries of your efforts.  Sorry it took me so long to say so."
