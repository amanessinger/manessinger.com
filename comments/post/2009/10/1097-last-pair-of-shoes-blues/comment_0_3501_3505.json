People tend to want everything in f2.8 or better, and when they see the Sigma 200-500/2.8, they wonder why it is so big, heavy and expensive. Interestingly enough I read today that Thom Hogan has high expectations for the performance of this lens. And then: DOF in the macro range is so shallow, your problem is normally not how much you can open up, it's how much you can stop down to get any DOF at all. No, I see f3.5 as irrelevant in the macro range, I even expect aperture in the macro range to be comparable to the other players in the market. On the other hand, VR is a big plus, and I suppose it is in the macro range as well."
