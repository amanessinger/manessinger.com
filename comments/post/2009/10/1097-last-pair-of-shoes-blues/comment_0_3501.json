    "content": "Andreas, you make an interesting argument for Nikon's recent announcement of the D3s and the DX 85mm f/3.5G VR, but I believe the niche you described would be small.  I find myself puzzled with Nikon's overall direction with their cameras, except for a definate focused on sensor sensitivity and ultra-high ISO--as I heard one article state, \"The D3s can suck light from a black hole.\" Enjoyed your post! ðŸ™‚"
