    "content": "Andreas, I enjoyed this post. Improvement is often achieve in small increments over an extended  period of time--only looking back to where we were can we see just how far we've come. I believe it's good to take measurement of that \"distance\" on a regular basis and to try and gain an understanding of our process and direction.  Style, I can't even conceive of myself having one. Or at least one that's not changing day-by-day, image-by-image. ;-)\n\nWhile I do like the convenience of a zoom lens, if I'm feeling mentally and/or creatively \"stuck\" I'll mount a prime lens and force myself to shoot with only it for a while. This restriction seems often gets things \"moving\" again."
