    "content": "Too much of a compliment, but yes, in a way I like Mondrian. His images are kind of ... honest. And of course simple, as simple as it possibly gets. He's not a big influence, but to say he did not influence me at all would be a lie either. This kind of mondrianesque aesthetics did not come from a conscious effort, in fact I did not think of Mondrian at all until you mentioned him, but now it really strikes me. Thanks ðŸ™‚"
