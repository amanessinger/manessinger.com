  "content": "Oh my, Brexit! Don't get me started. The best thing is Johnson Senior's application for French citizenship :)\n\nA hundred years ago, the conflict was between labour and capital. Today it is STILL between labour and capital, with nationalism being the successfully established strawman dividing the opposition. Capital has always been international. Never more than today. Capital acts freely worldwide, the damage is done worldwide. Any resistance would have to be internationally coordinated, but instead people let themselves be driven into nationalist frenzy. It's a game that has been perfected over a century. Brexit is just a culmination.\n\nThere is nothing, absolutely nothing that the UK couldn't do better within the EU. Instead the British Upper Class will sell out to the US. It won't make a difference for them. They own property on both sides of the pond anyway. They don't need the NHS, and if the quality of affordable food deteriorates because of deregulation, they'll buy expensive. It's not expensive for them. It's just the 90%, who will suffer.",
