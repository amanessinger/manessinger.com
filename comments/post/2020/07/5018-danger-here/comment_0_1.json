  "content": "Here in the UK we voted in a right wing government of lightweights based on the idiotic notion that we wanted to leave the EU. Their response to the pandemic has been shambolic and now the government message is get back to work whilst their health advisers say keep working from home!\n\nI don’t know about the rest of the UK but London’s problem is how to get people to work safely. Public transport is the only real option to get into London and The Tube is horribly overcrowded and an ideal environment for virus transmission. This is to be expected as it has been underfunded for years. \n\nThe government keeps pushing cycling but this just isn’t feasible for many people. For example, I live 10 miles from my office, have to wear a suit at work and there aren’t any showers once I get there. Even if I was fit enough, it would be an incredible hassle. No, I intend to stay working from home for as long as possible. ",
