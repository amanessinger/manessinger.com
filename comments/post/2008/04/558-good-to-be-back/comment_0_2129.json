If soft, blurry images are what you are after, you most definitely succeeded with this one.  I love the colors, the light and the depth of field.   This is beautiful.<br/><br/>And, I really like the image of the bicycle, too.  Very simple and very effective.<br/><br/>Not to worry that you missed a few days.  One does indeed need a bit of a break every now and then."
