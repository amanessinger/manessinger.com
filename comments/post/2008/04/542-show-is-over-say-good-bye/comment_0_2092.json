    "content": "Excellent work. My apologies for not having remarked on it until now. <br/><br/>I am familiar with variations of many of the techniques you have described in these past two tutorials, having used them myself in the past. I often do photo repair work for friends and to get things looking right often requires an extensive bag of tricks. To see your methods, and compare them to my own, is always a step towards improvement. As we constantly learn a little something new we must get better, right?<br/><br/>Your work with this image came out splendid, and it reminds me of just how much you massage your images to get the look you are after. You often, if not always, seem to have a clear direction in mind from the outset. Whereas I often do not. Of course, changing ones mind about a direction is always a possibility at any time, but my point is that you seem to have a better vision on the final piece from the outset. Which is something I may attempt to work on. <br/><br/>Also, I wanted to thank you for the comment on my \"Steps\" image. Oddly enough my original working of that image removes the very distractions you mention and presents a very different image. <a HREF=\"http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=25014\" REL=\"nofollow\">link</a> I obviously tried something different from my original formula, and I have to admit that I was never quite as satisfied with the second result. Now I can see why ðŸ™‚"
