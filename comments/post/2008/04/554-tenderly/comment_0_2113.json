    "content": "Hi Andreas --<br/><br/>This is such a lovely image!!  I love the shallow depth of field and the color triad of magenta, soft green and blue.  It is such a beautiful way to show that spring is on the way.  I also like the focus point being in the midst of the flowers, rather than at the front -- creates a tender softness all around.<br/><br/>\"Tenderly\" -- especially Billie Holiday's version -- is just the perfect song to accompany this image.<br/><br/>Hope you are feeling better!<br/>Marti"
