The detail in the highlights is great; I like to shoot a stop or two under and then push my highlights rather than deal with having 'holes' in my images.  Having zero information, or blown out regions, makes for some displeasing results if your work is ever printed using the 4-color process.<br/><br/>You've been putting out some great work recently, Andreas, keep it up!"
