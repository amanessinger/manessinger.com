    "content": "The little guy peering through the edge of his world with no sign of apprehension perfectly illustrates an abstract English word.... \"Spunky\". I suspect it is a compliment, although to some it might be though of as condescending. Funny how we smile at spunky people, spunky animals... And yet it also has a close cousin in the world of synonyms.. \"Tenacity\". And that's an attribute at which we never smirk. In fact it seems to define a lot  of what's going on in our Presidential race here in the US just now. <br/><br/>Once it was to the victor which went the spoils. But perhaps now it is to the spunky? Hmmmm....."
