Blogging, publishing one's work, is a different thing. I can remember how excited I was when I got my first comment on my fifth or sixth blog entry, only to find out that it was SPAM. It really didn't take that long, about a month, until I got the occasional real comment, and since then it has been quite steady. Basically that's what keeps us blogging and blogging forces me to stay creative. One fuels the other.<br/><br/>Thanks for your nice comment."
