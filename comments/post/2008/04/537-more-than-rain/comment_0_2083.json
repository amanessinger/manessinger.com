When I search for a Song of the Day, I search in these files for keywords in the name. Here it was simple: \"rain\". Well, the problem is, that I find the \"train\" songs as well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Finding the lyrics via Google is usually simple, Amazon almost always has the album, and nowadays most songs are on YouTube as well. Still: at times I spend more time with the song than with the image ðŸ™‚"
