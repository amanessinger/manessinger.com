It's striking how clear the colors are and how unexpected the composites. A broad scale to subjects. The experiments.<br/>They all inspire me to find new ways in making my own pictures I have in mind.<br/><br/>It is nice looking to someones view to the world around with pictures like this. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>With kind regards,<br/>Esther Jongste (my photographers name is Emma; to make things easy ;-) )<br/>Ooh, by the way, I am from the Netherlands"
