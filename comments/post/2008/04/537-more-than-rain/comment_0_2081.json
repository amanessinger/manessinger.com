And it is hard working, keeping them up tot date. ðŸ™‚( so I admire you're steadiness in this even more ðŸ™‚ )<br/>More recently work, you will find on my gallery at Zoom.nl. (if you are still interested; http://gallery.zoom.nl/user/3870/emma.html<br/>(last post, you will recognize in style.ðŸ˜‰ It's dedicated to friends of me. They are like the image, spreading light and warmth and coloring their surroundings.Nice people ;-) ) It's a Dutch Photo community where I post most frequently. <br/><br/>The BrightLightBlog is the one where I post photographs, for where I'm asked for.  This one is for a shop.They think about making postcards of this one, to sell them in their shop. Well that's a nice beginning for me. Don't you think?<br/><br/>There won't come a fifth (I think :-?)<br/>Hesitating where I will post this one. @yours or mine blog. Why not both. ðŸ™‚"
