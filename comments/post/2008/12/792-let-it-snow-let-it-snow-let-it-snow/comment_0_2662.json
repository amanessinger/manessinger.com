We live at a time when we have been given keys to entirely new portals. No one has ever gone this way before. We have lenses, cameras and processes which allow us to pursue clarity, contrast, sharpness, and of course access to color without constraint. Only our imagination limits the possibilities. Here you show us some of the distance we can go... it is a masterpiece."
