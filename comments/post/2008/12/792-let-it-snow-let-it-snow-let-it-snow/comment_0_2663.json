    "content": "Actually, I still really like JPG; however, now that I shoot fewer shots per 'session', I've been experimenting with raw and converting to DNG.<br/><br/>When I shoot JPG, I shoot on the lowest compression, highest quality, which gives me the best JPG that I can get. I've never been disappointed and have never been in a situation where I didn't get the shot, so the raw argument doesn't necessarily wash for me. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I think it important each person give both a try, see what they like, and shoot with it for a month or two, then make a decision. I've seen so much propaganda about raw files that it has almost become a religion, similar to the camera wars of who is better, Nikon or Canon."
