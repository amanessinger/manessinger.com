    "content": "I think that the main issue with many in selecting jpeg versus raw is the workflow issue. When you take just a few images per shoot, working with raw is just fine. <br/><br/>But if you take several hundred shots per shoot (or more), old workflows with raw were just too slow. Lightroom was, at least for me, a deal breaker in this sense. Now that working with raw is just as fast as jpeg I won't go back to jpeg (except when using my old 300D which is just too slow with raw). <br/><br/>And once you shoot black dogs in poor light with raw, you'll really learn to appreciate it ðŸ˜‰"
