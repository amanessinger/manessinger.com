    "content": "Thanks for the clear arguments about using RAW. Although I'm a jpeg-shooter, I have done some experimentation with a RAW workflow recently because of high-contrast snow landscapes. <br/><br/>It takes quite a lot of effort and experimentation to discover how many ways there are to fail... <br/><br/>Do you have some suggestions for references on this for a beginner? Is there a \"Photoshop book\" tailored for techniques such as this? I'm (for now) interested in getting best out of the files whether generated from RAW or bracketed exposure jpegs."
