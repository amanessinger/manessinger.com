    "content": "Oh, Fleetwood Mac! I once revealed my little knowledge of music when someone was praising Fleetwood Mac, and I went to say (I had bought \"Rumours\" recently) \"Aren't they just a pop band, nothing special\". And there was an inconvenient silence at that point.<br/><br/>Actually, I just checked that I don't have any Fleetwood Mac on the iMac at this point - I must have ripped Rumours at some point but deleted it later. I guess I should do a check on the first version of the band."
