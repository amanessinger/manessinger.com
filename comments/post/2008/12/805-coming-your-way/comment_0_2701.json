    "content": "Only my taste. Gladwell argues that the career of Fleetwood Mac culminated in \"Rumours\", and that's something you can't really say. FM were really two completely different bands that had nothing in common but a bassist, a drummer and a name, the former group being a fantastic blues rock band, driven by the genius of Peter Green, the latter a mainstream pop band completely dominated by Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham. There is no continuity, nothing at all, although Gladwell presents it that way.<br/><br/>And if there is any high-point in that shattered career, then it's \"Then Play On\", certainly not \"Rumours\". Hmpfh!"
