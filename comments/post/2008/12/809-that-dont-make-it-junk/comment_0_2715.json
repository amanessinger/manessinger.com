    "content": "We were talking about you at dinner on Sunday night. You'll recall Chris and Beth from our diner in Florence?  Well it seems that they and everyone else at the table of ten have visited this blog of yours over the past months. And they are not only fans, but were able to compare their favorite Manessingers, and quite impressed that Chris and I both actually met you (\"Whats Andreas actually like???\"). I'm certain that this posting will be particularly provocative the next time we meet. But it doesn't end with this group of Lancaster County people. Over the Christmas holiday we travelled to Pittsburgh where others talked of your work with me. <br/><br/>They were all referred to your site from mine, but they have kept up as well. You have developed an interesting and interested international audience here in places of which you may have never heard, but certainly, I'm sure, give much though (\"What is Andreas really like?\"). It's exciting to realize how your efforts are paying off Andreas. Congratulations and Happy New Year.<br/><br/>Ted"
