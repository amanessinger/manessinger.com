And then I wonder how much nature remains  virginal simply because it sits beneath a prophylactic protection of unimaginative technology?<br/><br/>At some point will a Jetson Age designer figure out how to dangle homes of the rich from those cliffs like so many Christmas ornaments? Or will this scene remain impregnable from earnings driven opportunism? <br/><br/>Love it when your images reeeeeely trigger my wonder... Thanks. Hope your Christmas was everything that Bing Crosby could have wished for.<br/><br/>Ted"
