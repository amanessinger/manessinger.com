    "content": "On music: there have been a lot of gems in the music suggestions you have picked. <br/><br/>One of the most difficult things I know is to recommend music to someone else, or to buy music based on the suggestion of someone else. <br/><br/>Some years ago I relied a few time too much on the Amazon recommendations (five stars etc.) and bought music which was unbearable to me. (But excellent for the fans I guess.) <br/><br/>Also, in music there seems to be a really \"long tail\" of excellent music, which never gets wider recognition. For example, in the SXSW 2008 sample collection there were a great deal of musicians I had never heard of but were a pleasure to listen to.<br/><br/>A problem is finding a bit more marginal music than that available on Amazon, Emusic etc. --- for example African music. Fela Kuti may be available, but not much more."
