    "content": "Great story. Understandable, but still quite a wonder, given the machinery of war and the hierarchy of command.<br/><br/>On of the SciFi books that I read recently, Ursula K. LeGuin's \"The Dispossessed\", tells the story of a man crossing between two societies, a traditional, modeled after the US, living on a planet, and his own, an anarchistic society living on its inhabitable moon. When he comes down to the planet and is confronted with the structure of military, he does not understand for a long time. <br/><br/>Finally he says, that he had a problem with the fact that such a chain of command is the most inefficient way to organize human beings. <br/><br/>Only after he saw them suppressing a riot and mowing down women and children with machine guns, only then did he recognize that the goal is not efficiency in the sense of making people productive, the goal is to make people do things to other people that they normally wouldn't do at all, and for that the organization is perfectly effective.<br/><br/>Thanks and the best to you as well!"
