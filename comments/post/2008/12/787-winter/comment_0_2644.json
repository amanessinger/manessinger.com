    "content": "Nope. I only use circular polarizers. As I said, it's a matter of color shifts. This is anything between subtle and not so subtle, but if you know what to look for, you see it. Some may be more, some may be less bothered with it. I am, and probably my only problem is, that I always have to make up for it in post-processing. <br/><br/>Normally I exactly know what to do in PP, but this is something that only happens whenever I use a polarizer, i.e. not too often, and I have no established routine for it. I always have to try, it costs me time, and when I am on a computer with an unreliable display, it really gets tedious."
