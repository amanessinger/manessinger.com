I have tweaked this image by the numbers. I'd have liked to be able to rely on automatic white balance just like I do normally, or at least to know that it is consistently off one way or the other. As it is, I can only describe it as colors paled out unevenly, some more than others. This is not a matter of cranking up saturation, this requires careful work.<br/><br/>But of course: in some situations you have not much choice but to use them, at the seaside being an especially drastic case. Still, I feel better without ðŸ™‚"
