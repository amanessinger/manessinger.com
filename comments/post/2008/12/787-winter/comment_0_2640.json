    "content": "Andreas, I have the opposite feeling about polarizers. I shoot a lot around water and love to take the glare off the surface. I also like the contrast it adds to skies and the deep blue it makes at 90degrees to the light. What I don't like is how its effects fade off at different angles to the light requiring careful blending in PS. I have the Hoya Pro 1 along with some cheaper models (3), I have not done side by side tests but I cannot tell which one I used based on the image. Try your polarizer on a clear stream, turn slowly and watch the water."
