See <a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/search/label/DxO%20Review\" REL=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Read in reverse order ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>As far as lens support goes, well, some of my favorite lenses are not supported, but that's not so important. Yes, DxO is extremely good at removing distortions, because it takes subject distance into account, but for all practical reasons you can do it later in Photoshop, using PTLens. That's available now on the Mac as well, and it has by far better lens support.<br/><br/>What really sets DxO apart, that is the fantastic quality of the RAW converter. Nowadays I do almost all my conversions in DxO, and certainly the high-ISO images."
