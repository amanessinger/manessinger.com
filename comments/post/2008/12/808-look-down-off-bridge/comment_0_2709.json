After all, maybe there will be a spontaneous need for a 2-7000mm f 1.0 zoom with all of the corresponding filters and lens shades. Meantime you never know if you'll immediately need a -200 mm negative wide angle along with the cleaning materials for it. And of course you really ought to be able to carry dishes and silverware sufficient to have lunch while deciding among which of seven prime lenses best meet the need of the moment. And... and... <br/><br/>Obviously you have an orthopod on retainer, along with a physical therapist and medical masseuse. Remember Igor in Young Frankenstine's famous line, \"What hump?\"<br/><br/>Instead of maximilism, howzabout the challenge of minimalism?<br/><br/>\"MINIMALISM???\" You screech. \"Are you really a photographer Ted? Do you not understand the gearhead rush that comes with owning such an astonishingly large bag that you have to buy more to fill in all of the spaces?\" <br/><br/>Sigh... I am trying to transcend maximilism. After years of photo therapy... I lookit the Lowepro Slingshot 200 All Weather Backpack and go AAARGH! You have made my shoulder hurt. And caused my back to hump.... \"What hump?\""
