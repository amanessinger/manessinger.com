I'd love to see you do a review of it.  <br/><br/>I went to their site and, unfortunately, they don't have a version that supports the D300 + Tamron 18-270. I looked at both the Pro and Elite versions. The combination is probably too new. <br/><br/>In reading the material, I like what I see. I think that it would make a great addition to my 'bag of tricks'; however, as I am saving my pennies to get my Macbrook Pro, I am not buying any more software until I get it. ðŸ™‚"
