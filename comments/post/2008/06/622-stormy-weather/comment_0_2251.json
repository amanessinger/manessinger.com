    "content": "Stencils are the natural extension of graffs... They are more efficient forms of self indulgence ... Here they are called stamps. Frankly I think the next step will see the vandals simply saving money on paints or stencils and merely smearing their excrement on walls then spraying it with some sort of quick hardening glue. Of course most of these things are a form of excrement already... Just not the most organic and cheaply available. <br/><br/>BTW, we both know that when the smearing begins, social enablers will declare the results to be high art and movements will develop to not only save them but to guard THEM against defacement. <br/><br/>And on..... It's the circle of life...."
