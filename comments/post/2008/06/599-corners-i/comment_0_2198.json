    "content": "Wide angle is the way I see the world. While I'm considering buying a telephoto for some portrait work, the wide view forces the peripheral into the, um, er.... ipheral?  And the things which we are largely aware of only subconsciously become all part of a single idea. And the fish eye packages it into the mystical shape it deserves. <br/><br/>You are flowing so effortlessly into this sort of blending, and it's wonderful to share the exploration. Along with the commentators upon your original staircase posting... I agree that the melding of a spiral staircase with the wonderful implied spiraling of a fish eye was brilliant. And this exercise in wandering around corners with your lens is also gripping. <br/><br/>Too many photographers become intimidated by a fish eye cranking out mere distortions on the one hand or frustration images on the other. I really like how you are coming at is just one more tool to color your voice."
