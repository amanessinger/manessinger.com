It was frustrating for the first three days (a tool that completely voids all your compositional strategies), but now it gets workable and fun again.<br/><br/>As I said, this \"Corners\" thing will eventually grow into a series of images, and what I am really after here, is to reveal, not to primarily distort. In fact this worked quite well with this Image of the Day, although I am not satisfied with the composition.<br/><br/>Anyway. It's really a beast of a walk-around lens, and I'll keep taming it and letting it run my way ðŸ™‚"
