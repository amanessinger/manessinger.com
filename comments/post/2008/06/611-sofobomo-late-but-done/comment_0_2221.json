Of course \"NEWS\" should be somewhere at the top, but I like the two widgets with the images greatly. I have tried all sorts of widgets (BlogRush, some bookmarking widgets), and they are all rubbish. These from <a HREF=\"http://blogsjam.citipals.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">BlogsJam</a> work. At normal times, when I don't have a tutorial freshly up, I get about five percent of my hits from people browsing the widget. That's great. It makes my site easily accessible for people who would otherwise only have read a tutorial.<br/><br/>Regarding page 25: Interesting, but I should have known. While I took it, it reminded me of the lower left of your lighthouse images <a HREF=\"http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2008/04/pidgeon.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">here</a> ðŸ™‚"
