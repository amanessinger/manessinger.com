    "content": "B&W is the last refuge of the color challenged. It is a surrender to the complexity of chrome. It is retro in the sense of typewriters and quill pens. It where we find the sort of people who wear spats, carry walking sticks, and wax their mustaches. <br/><br/>I'll grant that it is quaint the way a little Scott Joplin is quaint. The way player-piano rolls are quaint. The way that silent movies, wooden teeth, and pompadours are... There are set pieces that are best done as costume epics, with bustled women and straw hatted men... and black and white photographs... captured by large wooden cameras in a puff of flash powder that soaks your clothes with its acrid scent for weeks. <br/><br/>In all of these ways black and white is a charming place for some people to escape to... when the real challenge of COLOR BECOMES TOO DIFFICULT.... <br/><br/>Um... but of course i have no firm opinions regarding B&W and remain quite open minded about the entire subject ðŸ™‚"
