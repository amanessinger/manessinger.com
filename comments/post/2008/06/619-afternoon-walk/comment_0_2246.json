    "content": "The bicycle collection transports (no pun) me to where kids live. A big bike equipment company recently tried to discover why fewer people were riding bikes bikes less, and why many had abandoned riding them altoether. They thought maybe folks were getting too fat and lazy. So they went and asked hundreds of non bike riders worldwide what had happened.<br/><br/>And they learned that people loved bikes. That they yearned for the experience of their childhood... wind in their hair, sitting upright, pedaling backwards to stop.... They recalled the fat seats and the bright paint, chrome, horns and bells. The remembered baskets and streamers and fat tires whispering along the roads and bumping over old roads.<br/><br/>And they looked at the new bikes and all their gears, and their exposed greasy chains, razor thin tires, the many things that break, and the perfectly muscular gearheads who sold them while wearing  humiliating costumes and ugly hats... and they felt a disconnect between their memories and the Tour De - whatever or the cross country Xtreme sporting and they figured it was all competition now. That prizes were the objective, or fat burning, or earth saving or... or... Or anything other than sitting upright, wind it their smiles, and the bump bump bump of freedom under their fannies. <br/><br/>By marketing intensely to people who saw bikes as tools the bike makers left the great majority who remembered them as a pleasure process. And as works of popular art.<br/><br/>The result of this study was the introduction of the Coaster Bicycle which is now the best selling type of bicycle in the world."
