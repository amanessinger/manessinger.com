Unfortunately that often doesn't stop at visual impressions but continues to most parts of life.<br/><br/>So, it's all the more nice to get those photographic impressions of a relaxed roam through vienna.<br/><br/>Just for the record, I hate Mofas. Loud and stinking, acustic and olfactory environmental pollution. Good that your photos are so quiet... ;-)"
