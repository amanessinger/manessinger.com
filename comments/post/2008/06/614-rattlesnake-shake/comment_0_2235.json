I'd even have had some other promising candidates, but this was the first that I tried and therefore it won.<br/><br/>And that is is the fisheye at all? This was not real preference, but it was the only wide angle lens that I carried with me. Wide angles are so much easier at night, because you can go down very low with your speeds. This was 1/8s handheld, and I could probably have gone down to 1/4s."
