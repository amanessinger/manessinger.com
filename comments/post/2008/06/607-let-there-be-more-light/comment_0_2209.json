    "content": "The greatest problem with the wides and superwides is the way they shove things farther apart and emphasize the space between. Wide angle shots can be more about the spaces between life than life itself. Here's a great example... <br/><br/>I've got mixed emotions about the effect. Personally wides have taught me to be aware the cracks in an illusion I'm trying to build. And I reflexively fill them up. BUT, you know what? Maybe there's a whole new message to pull out of those between-things. But wait, thats the point... the 'things' can't be in the spaces right?<br/><br/>There's some great philosophical truth here... Hmmmm....."
