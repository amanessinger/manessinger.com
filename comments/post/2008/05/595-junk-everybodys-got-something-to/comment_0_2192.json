Over here people start putting flags on their cars and probably begin to rehearse the national anthem and don't see how they are balled by the big money makers. I do remember well '86 when most concerns about the Tschernobyl catastrophy became 2nd class just because of the soccer world cup. So I am feeling with you, but we are probably not many."
