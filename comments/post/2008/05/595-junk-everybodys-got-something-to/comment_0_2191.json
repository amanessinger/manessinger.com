I have been reading yours for a few weeks now, via my <a HREF=\"http://herolawan.blogspot.com\" REL=\"nofollow\">friend's blog</a>.  I really like the way you compose the layout of your posts, and as I kind of said the other day, it inspired me to upgrade mine.  I swear I'm trying my best not to copy, but rather to come up with a similarly clever layout. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I also want to thank you for asking me such probing questions.  They really got the wheels in my head turning, and I decided to post about it.  You can see my answers to your questions <a HREF=\"http://rhymeswithmilk.blogspot.com/2008/05/day-46.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">here</a>."
