Now as I think back upon them they are a ballet... twisting and turning through changing light usually with vivid matte colors. <br/><br/>You are drawn to them almost as a mysterious metaphor for what is missing... the cities around them and the people who unknowingly created each small stage set for your camera.<br/><br/>Perhaps a series of squares (maybe four or six) printed on large pieces of paper... they will be astounding hung in a row. Or in the same room. You must have a number of them now and everyone holds a piece of story. <br/><br/>You really should collect them for us Andreas. Um... I mean you really should collect them for you... yeah... you.... heh heh heh..."
