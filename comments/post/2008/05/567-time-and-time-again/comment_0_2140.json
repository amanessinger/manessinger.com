And this is his rival. <br/><br/>At the risk of insulting... this is astonishingly <br/>American in its bold, audacious sense of self worth. You are yowling a pride and ambitious sense of optimism that simply makes me feel wonderful. <br/><br/>I've often thought about the margin where mountain tops meet the majesty of the universe... and how much they tell us... what a step they proclaim, yet they give up nothing in terms of grandeur to the immensity of sky, clouds, and the vastness beyond.<br/><br/>Each puts the other into perspective at the margin. At the point they meet... yet don't. <br/><br/>Yep... this is an epic. Congrats.<br/><br/>Ted"
