    "content": "Okay... you have opened up a PRIMAL question... what is the aesthetically perfect set of dimensions? Why do we shudder when we see circular framing? Why do we accept that some German engineers early in the last century created in the 35m format the \"perfect\" framing? <br/><br/>Certainly the dimensions of the CRT tube are perhaps the worst compromise between length and width ever presented to artists. And perhaps the Cinemascopic dimensions may approach a very satisfying option. <br/><br/>BTW... when we discuss idealized dimensions why do we first debate horizontals, then simply apply the results of that debate to verticals? Are they equally satisfied by a one-size-fits-all dimensionality? <br/><br/>I think it was Paul Strand who wrote something like, \"Reality exists to be cropped.\" Well, those are my words... but his thoughts. And Cartier-Bresson who argued that any cropping from the 35mm format was apostasy. <br/><br/>They were both great... one had to be wrong. <br/><br/>Nope, won't buy it to hear, \"It depends\". What is the ideal Length to width? Oh sure we can deviate from that combination once discovered as the situation demands, but still, is there one combination over all others which best appeals to the human eye? <br/><br/>And wuddahell izzit?<br/><br/>Ted"
