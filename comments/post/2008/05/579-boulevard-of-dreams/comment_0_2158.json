    "content": "We mostly produce for a medium. Panoramic images are fine for walls, and even then they need much wall. 3x2 is not a golden rectangle, but it is definitely more pleasing to my eye than 4x3.<br/><br/>I have a 3x2 viewfinder (and a good one), and by using it to compose, I primarily compose for that format. Doing otherwise, i.e. composing for, say, square, always needs some extra effort. I can do that, but it does not feel as natural, is another level of indirection, and therefore I don't do it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, accepting the proportions of a given frame is simply one of the many restrictions that we accept as given. See, it's a restriction, yes, but it is one thing less to care about. At times this can free creative energies. Ultimately I am with Ted: It's a good idea to reflect about these things."
