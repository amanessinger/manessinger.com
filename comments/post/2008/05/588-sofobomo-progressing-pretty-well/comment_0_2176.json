Thanks for following up with your image, though, I dig it.  I love how the closest fence wires are enlarged due to proximity and their blurred lines create a feeling of being in jail or something.  This is a cool presentation of nature in all its beauty within the confines of man's concrete jungle.  Looks like the ball's in my court now, Andreas.  ðŸ™‚"
