In your radiant countrysides..... and mine... we look for beauty (you've seen my essay on that?)<br/><br/>And we assiduously ignore the universally tacky. In  the suburbs of glorious Florence I found block after block of box factory buildings. They could have ringed Philadelphia or stood in the Jersey oil fields. <br/><br/>How much of our nests are getting fouled with the terminally banal? Hmmmmm.... I've tried to get  my lens around it.. but its so common... so ordinary... that I can't use any of my images to make the point. <br/><br/>There are serial despoilers wreaking havoc all around us and leaving their architectural dung piles.<br/><br/>It's interesting that the closest we come to admitting our dirty little dingy secrets is the odd graffiti, eh?"
