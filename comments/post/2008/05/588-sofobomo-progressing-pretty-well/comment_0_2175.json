    "content": "Thanks Bill. I definitely will. I have no idea how to ever finish the series, much less the book, but I will ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>Ted, I'll do my best ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image actually is part of a series, or rather two. <br/><br/>Remember those see-through images taken with 200mm/f5.6? These Image, where I used blurry flowers as colored foregrounds? See \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/03/521-stories-of-street.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">521 - Stories Of The Street</a>\", \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/03/522-war-no-more-war-no-more.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">522 - War No More, War No More</a>\" and \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/03/523-pink-thing.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">523 - Pink Thing</a>\" for example. This is one series.<br/><br/>The other one is \"Electric Ladyland\", those images about the power lines gracing (or grazing??) our landscapes. See \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/02/487-electric-ladyland-ii.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">II</a>\", \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/02/489-electric-ladyland-iii.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">III</a>\" and \"<a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/03/528-electric-ladyland-iv.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">IV</a>\".<br/><br/>And at the crossing of these two threads is my buddy <a HREF=\"http://blog.codyredmon.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">Cody Redmon</a> from <a HREF=\"http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">Fine Art Photoblog</a>. Recently on his blog he posted an image inspired by  \"<a HREF=\"http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/landscape/electric-ladyland-iii\" REL=\"nofollow\">Electric Ladyland III</a>, that I had posted on Fine Art Photoblog. Cody has taken one particular quality of my image, ignorance of the \"non-worthiness\" of a subject, and interpreted it in the way of the see-through images, by shooting through an \"unworthy\" foreground. See his post \"<a HREF=\"http://www.codyredmon.com/blog/2008/05/13/obstructed-beauty/\" REL=\"nofollow\">Obstructed Beauty</a>\" and the excellent image.<br/><br/>In a comment to Cody's post, I promised a response. Ever since then I have looked for one of these opportunities. It is one of the things that I keep my eyes open for.<br/><br/>Now you have it. Seems like you, Ted, have just opened another series ðŸ™‚"
