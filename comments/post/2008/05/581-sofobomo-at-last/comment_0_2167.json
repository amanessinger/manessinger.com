I cannot imagine you preoccupied by bathrooms, grass blades or sunsets. <br/><br/>You have a genre. You are a master street photographer. Why would you limit that to a study of pores instead of faces? There are times when the trees really do obscure forests. And cobblestones the streets. <br/><br/>You have developed a voice. Do you really want to use it to sing one song? Yipes. I've never been excited by single minded and narrow projects exercises. They seem to be more of a \"Guess what's on the teacher's mind\" challenges than portals to expanding the mind. <br/><br/>In economics there is a concept called, opportunity costs.
