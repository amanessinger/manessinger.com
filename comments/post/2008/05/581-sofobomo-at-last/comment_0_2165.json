This is the first year that this project has started thanks to Paul  Butzi and I think its important at least for us as artists that we contribute to the project.<br/><br/>I decide to start later as I needed more warm weather for the foliage to start to grow as I wanted to capture some of the landscape and nature around me.<br/><br/>I wasnâ€™t sure of the project theme, but did select one. I have now decided to augment this theme, as it was not easy to get more images from the first location on time. <br/><br/>Niels"
