I'm quite exhausted now, have not seen the images so far, but at least the numbers are quite OK<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Some time passes<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>OK, I've slept a little. It's 4 am now, I have just browsed through the images and it looks good. Tomorrow it's supposed to rain all Day. Fine for processing ðŸ™‚"
