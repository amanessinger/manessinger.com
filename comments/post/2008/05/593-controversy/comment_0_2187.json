It is also nice to read that others are feeling challenged and are also ready to try to do something about it. Maybe we all need to go to the desert. <br/><br/>The internet and blogs have been around for a while, but some are really starting to question why we do it, how to do it better, and how can we make it valid for readers? <br/><br/>How long does it take a photographer to find their own voice? Maybe several years, and maybe it never ends. Blogs might be the same way, but they might also help us in finding that voice. At least that is what I hope. <br/><br/>Jay W"
