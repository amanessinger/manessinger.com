    "content": "Hi Andreas,<br/><br/>Even though I am a photography blogger myself I tend to agree with Joe, though not in that harsh way.<br/>I also question myself and others about real quality in photography and I admit that I learned way much more from my 80-year-old portrait photography instructor than from the Internet.<br/>And my blog posts are shallow in many cases just like my small talk is with my friends. Do I want to go beyond that? Yes, I do, but even if I manage to do that, I'll keep my blog for entertaining myself and maybe others.<br/>Taking the risk might mean slowing down, not posting for a while, only when real quality work is born.<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/>Tibor"
