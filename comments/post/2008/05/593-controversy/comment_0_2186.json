The urge to kill the project and yet if you could keep it simple it would be easy to complete.<br/><br/>On the SoFoBoMo part I do hope you are able to complete it.  It is really fun at the end to have produced a book maybe only an <i>ebook</i>, but I will at least for one copy get it published. <br/><br/>There is a deadline but in my view it is not sacrosanct and if it took a little longer no big deal. Please do finish as I really would like to see it when it is completed.<br/><br/>Now if there were prizes awarded maybe then the deadline would be more important.<br/><br/><br/>On the blogging side, I write articles to share some of the knowledge that I have gained over the years and in some way to payback or is <i>payforward</i> for the help from many people over the years.<br/><br/>I am not promoting a business by blogging, even though I enjoy selling the odd print, not for the money but for the fact that someone likes it enough to pay for it.<br/><br/>Like you, many bloggers have become my friends over the years and while we don’t really talk that often I believe that if we met face to face we would have a good time.<br/><br/>I like your pictures of the day. I haven’t visited the area where you live and your images are not the standard tourist type image which makes them enjoyable.<br/><br/>There is a lot of information out on the web and not all of it is doctorial in depth, so what.<br/><br/>When I talk to my friends and acquaintances we are no always  so deep in discussion anyways.  It is amazing that even from the seemingly fluff article I may sometimes learn something new.<br/><br/>Good Luck and do finish the book.<br/><br/>Niels Henriksen"
