    "content": "So? What have you discovered about patterns? About color? About texture? About the essence of feeling? About the ambiguity which cannot, no matter  how hard you try, be overcome? <br/><br/>About the 'if only' cursing that happens when you see the results on your computer screen and wonder 'if only' you'd panned a tad more left, pulled a tad more back, grabbed a tad more sky, earth, chest, or leg? <br/><br/>And if there's one thing that you now know better than you ever imagined you would when you posted #1... Can you share it so we will know it too?<br/><br/>I recall way back you were thinking of specializing in one something or other... What was that? But instead you chose to not be distracted by narrowcasting. I think that should have been one of your happiest decisions. Was it? <br/><br/>And lastly, if there is an essence to a Manessinger image... Something which suggest that the image is yours more than anyone else's - what do you think it is? I know what I think it is... But what interest is that? <br/><br/>Have you grown from this discipline? How? <br/><br/>There are essays in these questios that I doubt you have the time to write.. since #501 is due so soon. And yet... only you can write those essays... to allow us to grow, just as surely as we've grown from watching what you've watched along this trip so far.<br/><br/>Thanks for that Andreas.<br/><br/>Ted"
