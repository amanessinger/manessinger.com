It always amazes me how similar, and yet, how different they can appear from those in my area. Also like the perspective and DOF that the 70mm gives you. The images from it remind me a lot of those from my 90mm. Which I suppose is not surprising, given that they are both macro lenses with similar characteristics. <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Michael"
