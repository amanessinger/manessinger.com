He's had a tremendous number of them published and performed by recording and concert artists. <br/><br/>I asked him how he could be so prolific. \"Actually,\" he replied, \"I seem to really have two problems. First in turning off the spigot, and secondly to decide which to really develop for audition tapes. When I sit to write, the keyboard seems to startle me with so many surprises that it's a problem not so much to stay on the bronco, as it is to let him toss me off.\"<br/><br/>These three are all disparate looks into your imagination. But since you insist we choose by posting them all together, yet apart... I agree with the featured piece. Its mystery is cinematic. Some wonder if it's possible to be grim in color. If a color mood can be ominous. It's images like this which retire that wonder, eh?"
