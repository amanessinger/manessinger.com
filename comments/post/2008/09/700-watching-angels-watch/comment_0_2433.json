    "content": "Nick asked \"Didn't the camera system prove useful in the London bombings?\"<br/><br/>Hm, did it circumvent the bombings? Nope. I mean, do we really expect people who are prepared to blow themselves up to get scared because their actions are recorded on tape?<br/><br/>Nope, that solution is not really one, it only provides a false sense of security - at the very least when we're talking about serious terrorists.<br/><br/>If there is something that I feel even more uncomfortable with than the authorities' all-intruding eyes and ears, I guess that it would be private eyes and ears. I would really feel offended if private organisations would start mounting cameras in my neighborhood. In my mind it's really a societies confession of failure if we think that this would change things for the better in the long run.<br/><br/>And, as Andreas has discussed it in his original post, it opens the way for all different kinds of abuses. We've had too many cases in Germany where the guys behind the security cameras had their ''fun'' spying on peoples (usually womens') life.<br/><br/>I guess it all boils down to the very personal question on how much freedom and privacy one is willing to sacrifice for a feeling of security.<br/><br/>Personally, I am really convinced, that our (increasing?) societal problems will not be solved by easy, technological gadgets."
