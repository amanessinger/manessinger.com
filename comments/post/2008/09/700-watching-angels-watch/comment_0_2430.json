    "content": "Aren't the cameras (and online data) really an erosion of (expected) privacy as opposed to liberty? <br/><br/>I am very much of two minds with respect to these issues. As a private citizen, my viewpoint is similar to yours. People (even if only a select few) will abuse power for a variety of reasons ranging from personal gratification to doing \"what is right\" in that person's frame of mind. <br/><br/>Immediately after 9/11 in the USA there were military at several of the airports that I flew through. I understand that this is the norm in many countries, but I was personally uncomfortable about this. My guess is that most Americans would like to keep the status quo. As such, the erosion of privacy is accepted as it is relatively non-intrusive. <br/><br/>It's easier to ignore / accept the background surveillance than the overt show of military in our daily lives. That doesn't make the surveillance any less subversive to our \"ideals.\" <br/><br/>Of course, the counter argument to all of this is that if you believe that our current methods of keeping and protecting the population are not effective (perhaps as demonstrated by attacks daily in the world) what can be done?<br/><br/>Didn't the camera system prove useful in the London bombings? At least that is what I was lead to believe through our news media. <br/><br/>It certainly seems that the pendulum has swung (in the USA) too far for my taste, but I'm sure that one could argue that it needed to at least move. <br/><br/>Maybe? Food for thought at least...."
