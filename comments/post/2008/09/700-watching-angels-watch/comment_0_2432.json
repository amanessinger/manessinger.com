    "content": "I've thought about your questions, the last view days. And they are really interesting to think over and over.<br/> <br/>The price of freedom, the price of safety. Two terms, where one can think to know that the meaning for everyone is the same. But if you ask, everyone has a different explanation for them. <br/><br/>Have you seen the movie Manderlay (Larz von Trier)? It's almost a musthaveseen one. (okÃ© freedom, huh) It shows in a surprising way the multiple meaning of freedom.<br/><br/>For me is freedom of mind (or spirit), one of the most important ones. You have to give up other kinds of freedom to get the one you desire, I think. It asks offers in a mostly unexpected way.<br/><br/>Safety? How safe is safe?<br/>The price? You have to keep the traffic rules, to have a safe journey. (Something like that?)<br/>I know there are angels watching, 24/7 and it's for free. ðŸ™‚ Safer than safe? It's not a guarantee that anything can happen. But it gives the freedom, to do the things, I think I'll have to do. <br/><br/>(I hope that, it's a little bit understandable. In Dutch I'm much more trained to give words to this kind of stuff. I will explain further, if necessary) ðŸ™‚"
