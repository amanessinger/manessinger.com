    "content": "Is this really a camera over the doors of a church? Yeah, that's a social comment. <br/><br/>I live in the heart of a city, smack in the epicenter of its historic district. In our city the police have no cameras. But a private, non-profit group mounts them throughout the city. In every case the cameras have reduced every sort of crime within their circle of vision. We have contributed enough to have one mounted across the street from our home. It is one that joins with three others to sweep our street and completely cover the park which we adjoin. Again, virtually all crime, drug dealing, and even simple fights among kids have disappeared. <br/><br/>It's not so much that I have nothing to hide, but that I chose to move into a city where everyone can see me on the streets. If they can see me anyway, why not let them see me on camera? I take candid shots of street people Why is that okay, but neighbors supporting picture taking by a team of people who will report disorder to our public safety people? <br/><br/>Is it okay if I report something I see out of my window, but not okay if the camera operator makes the report? Would you contact the public safety people should you see someone in distress outside of your home? <br/><br/>Hmmmm.... I'd rather the additional sets of eyes watching what I cannot watch. I am not paranoid in my skepticism regarding city behavior, but I wonder if those who suspect the motives of the camera operators might not have a mild dose of the disorder?<br/><br/>Comparing activity monitoring in public places with intrusion into our most private bank accounts, medical records, or papers is a dubious analogy my friend. And it worries me that by natural extension your reasoning would ban my camera from the city streets. ðŸ™‚"
