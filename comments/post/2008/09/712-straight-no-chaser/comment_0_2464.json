Paul, let me tell you, that's only the other side of G.A.S. ðŸ™‚\"<br/><br/>Reality is certainly funny. I still have the itch, but need to constantly remind myself that I really don't need that camera, which is true.  I, like the next guy, like shiny new toys. There is no reason, at all, for me to get a D700 and I will do everything that I can to avoid getting one.<br/><br/>This is not because I think it is wrong, but because it goes against what I believe in. I have enough cameras. Too many in fact. It's time to start winnowing down to a more manageable level. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I'll keep an eye on you to see when you will purchase your D700!"
