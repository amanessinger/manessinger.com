    "content": "Well, actually this was done with a $120 lens, the Nikon 50/1.8D. The secret is only to shoot wide open (f1.8 here) and focus very near, here approximately the nearest focus distance, something about 40cm. Then you only need a bright, colored background that's far away. <br/><br/>I stood in front of a car, focused at the door frame on my side and shot straight over the blue car onto a shop on the other side of the street. No magic."
