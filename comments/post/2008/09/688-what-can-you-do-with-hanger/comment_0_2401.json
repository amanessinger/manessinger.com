I like it that I keep hunting in that cart, and in the foreground and the background for details that make this sensible to me. I like it that you don't expect your camera to act like some sort of vacuum that plucks just exactly your meaning from the light soaked objects at which you aim it. Nope, I like it that you have made this something that it wasn't when you came upon it. Which is to say, you have done differently here what you normally do... Perhaps more dramatically...<br/><br/>Namely, you have created art out of what the camera merely saw. And that is what I reeeeeely like.<br/><br/>Ted"
