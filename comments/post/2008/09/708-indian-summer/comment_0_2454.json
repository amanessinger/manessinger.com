We have them as well, only as garden flowers, not in the wild. <br/><br/>These here are really high, think of 6, 7 feet, they are more yellow, less orange than the susans, and they have much smaller flower heads than typical sunflowers. They seem to lack the typical seeds as well, but from what I have seen, they are definitely related to the sunflowers."
