The tripod, I will grant, give you a tremendous ability for reflection, even though I've watched you use is quite quickly. But it does deny you some of the spontaneity that your faster lenses can achieve. <br/><br/>I have the feeling that you would feel quite lost, like the amputee without his leg, without that thing to steady your machinery. On the other hand, I know I'd feel as if I'd grown another elbow if I carried one. <br/><br/>I sense in much of your work a large camera accomplishment. Your work has that sense of elegant presence that a big format provides... and that must be in part from your mastery of the tripod. Still except for elaborate pre-arrangement, or in portraiture, the tripod does  kind of hinder street candids of people. <br/><br/>OTH you have a number of times used people as props in picturing some important city scene. And they have been reeeeeeely effective. Still it makes it difficult to force the unexpected moment to happen, no?"
