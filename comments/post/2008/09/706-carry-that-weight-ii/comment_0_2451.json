    "content": "Oh no, Ted, you got that wrong. I did use a tripod in Florence, but here in Vienna I don't use it at all. Would be rather stupid to carry it around to/from work. No, almost all of my work is shot handheld. The last images that I shot from the tripod were for my SoFoBoMo book, that was in May, and there I had to use it for my multi-seconds exposures.<br/><br/>No, it's not the tripod. It's the fact that I like to study my subjects for some seconds, try some shots, in other words, rely on them being immobile. As I said, photographing people is a different thing. You are much more dependent on luck."
