    "content": "You have inspired me to take pictures of bicycles.  I have, and no matter what I do, mine do not resonate. <br/><br/>It's not that I feel competitive, merely, as I said, inspired. But usually inspiration encourages me. But what you are doing is way beyond bikes as still life. You are finding something more here in your emanations. <br/><br/>Have you ever tried to break down the secret to say, a great comedian. Especially one that does life style humor as opposed to jokes? You know there's a pattern, a secret, a mechanism. After all he's got a style, and he's a type. Yet the secret is unbreakable even se he makes you laugh every time. <br/><br/>I'm suspecting your talent is analogous to that. It so far defies my analysis. And I've not been able to fine my own with this subject. It is VERY impressive Andreas. Congratulations."
