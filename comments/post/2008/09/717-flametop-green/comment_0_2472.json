I look at them just as you would look at people. They have character. They pose. They can be casual, they can show off. They have scars, they have histories. All that does not come without quite some involvement on my side and that did not emerge all by itself. <br/><br/>I guess I could make images in your style (or anyone's), but it would take me a long, long time, and it still would not be perfect. So, why do it at all? They wouldn't even be mine! <br/><br/>And most of all: they would not be good. They could not. Never, because in order to emulate your style I would have to try to sneak into your soul - and lose mine ðŸ™‚"
