In fact it creates some tension in the image especially since the newer stronger and flashier bike seems to be dominant over the older bike, like in the animal kingdom (It does help to have a strange imagination)<br/><br/><br/>I have enjoyed now for a while all the images you have of bicycles. This is one of the reasons I did my little series and I knew there might be a few who would appreciate the subject.<br/><br/>Niels"
