His images become more like the 'Little Village' look (In Holland we have Madurodam, in your country there will be something like that, I think). <br/>The techniques you combine is a very interesting one. I'll keep it in mind and some day, I will remember and use it in my own way on my images. Inspiring. ðŸ™‚"
