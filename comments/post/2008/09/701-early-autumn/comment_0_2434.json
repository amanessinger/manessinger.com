For the image, I have to admit that I am a fan of the shallow-DoF-softness that makes the structures blend (a 1.4/85 is on my wishlist since quite a while), and the strong yellow of the rapeseed is like a last rebellion of strength and liveliness of the summer against the impending autumn that already puts its mark on the green of the leaves. Well done."
