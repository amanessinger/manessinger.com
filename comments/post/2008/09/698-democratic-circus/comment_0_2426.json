    "content": "In Holland we say: it isn't all gold that shines. (translated, of course ;-) )<br/>In England they say it in almost the same way: All that glisters is not gold.<br/>And in German it isn't any different: Es ist nicht alles Gold, was glÃ¤nzt.<br/>Your story versus the image. There must be some truth in it. And not only in your country, I suppose. ðŸ™‚<br/>About the image: Such uniformity, it must be artificial, enforced, created, feigned. (Are that the right words to it?) Strong choice.<br/>It's a reflection of the whole Democratic Circus."
