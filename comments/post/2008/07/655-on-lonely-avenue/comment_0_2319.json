Great! ðŸ™‚ I guess we could chat a bit about Tad Williams and George R.R. Martin? And speculate why Robert Jordan started great and became mediocre after a couple of thousand pages...<br/><br/>@Subash: I always found the \"Empire and Foundation\" books superior to the robot stories. But anyway, Asimov was fabulous, also his scientific textbooks.<br/><br/>Oh, and before I forget: that picture of the day is - once again - real eye candy. Thanks for sharing, I those contrasts and movements in it are a real joy to look at."
