    "content": "Hi Andreas!<br/><br/><i>Science Fiction ages rapidly.</i><br/><br/>Maybe but there are great exceptions. Think of Isaac Asimov. His robot stories today are as good as they were before. The four laws of the robots and their consequences are also worth considering now and they give thrilling thoughts! And: One could make great films with his stories as \"I robot\" proofed.<br/><br/>Anyway: Thanks for sharing your thoughts and pictures!<br/><br/>Subhash"
