    "content": "Ah, tell me about hysteria and xenophobia! I am living in Bavaria, and the background sound is always like this, trying to reach new peaks when elections are ahead... But this time I have to admit the austrian government and the parties that will form the next one (for me that's the real sad thing, that you know in advance that this will happen) won't stay behind the scariest options we have in Germany. So I do understand your grievance, but I have to admit: widespread reflection will just never happen, and the yellow press in both our countries do have their share in this (those headlines are a daily source of agression and depression).<br/>But it starts to get really frightening when you visit countries were ultras make *real* use of xenophobia, and where kalashnikovs and claymores are cheap and at everybody's easy disposal. It's incredible that slushy politicians can get so much support for an evanescent amount of brain.<br/>But we will have to live with this and still can enjoy a very peaceful and - in comparison to others - not overly hysteric part of Europe."
