I just try to imagine the picture with a dirty grey foreground as I experience it so often - and therefore seem to fall in the trap of replacing seeing with anticipation sometimes.<br/>So here you did an excellent job on invoking and enforcing the powerful colors of an italian morning. Thank you for this eye-opener.<br/><br/>Markus"
