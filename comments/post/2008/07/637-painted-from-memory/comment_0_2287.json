    "content": "Hi,<br/><br/>I can elaborate a bit more on my comment on memory. Thinking about the processing work we do in Photoshop or with whichever tools we use, it seems that we are adjusting an image not so much as to get it the way it literally was, but to get it like we remember it. After the instant of capture, all we have is our memory of what this vision was.<br/><br/>Landscape photographers might strive to have every pixel distinct and in crisp focus because that was the image that struck. We remember the clarity of the entire panorama.<br/><br/>Portrait photographers remember the subject, and try to make the surrounding less distinct because they are less important to the memory.<br/><br/>And when you shoot an old fan, you might darken the image, or leave it dim to make it feel older, more of a memory.<br/><br/>Thanks for the pictures. I enjoy your work."
