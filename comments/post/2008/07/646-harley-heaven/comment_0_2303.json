    "content": "Will this count among the images for your bicycle book? I'm wondering if it should. Isn't a motor cheating? On the other hand it is a bi-cycle, and the Vespa you have posted a few days after this is also an imagination magnet. <br/><br/>A sidebar... I carry a wad of large plastic sandwich bags that are clear and large enough to cover my camera. I've found that in storms  I can place the camera and lens facing inward with the back toward the opening. I can the make a cut on the bottom, stick the lens out of the cut and place the lens shade on the outside trapping the edges of the bag inside of the mount of the lens shade. I can either hold the rear opening closed and peer at the image on my monitor screen, or open the back a tiny bit so I can peer through my viewfinder. The auto focus takes care of that problem and I can trip the shutter through the bag. I've found that a couple of rubber bands will hold the bag snug when wrapped around the outside. <br/><br/>The thing looks like hell... very geeky. But It can be thrown over the camera quickly and protects it amazingly in storms. (Yes the front of the lens surface may get wet which may add to the artistry but which can also be easily wiped with a lens protected rag that I carry in my bag. Usually though the lens hood keeps the surface relatively dry and if you have a protective UV filter atop the lens... the droplets are of no consequence (I don't use a protective filter... I fear they degrade the fabulously expensive pieces of glass in which I have invested). <br/><br/>The entire protection takes almost no room and I've used it in blinding snowstorms as well as teaming rain - even once a hurricane - without ever getting a drop on my camera (beyond the lens hood... but who cares?)."
