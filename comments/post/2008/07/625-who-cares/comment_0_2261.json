    "content": "Thanks all.<br/><br/>Ted, I really look forward to hear of your findings. I'm particularly interested in hearing if there is a difference between artistic creativity and business creativity. Sure, in business the risks you take can lead to your financial ruin, thus I think creativity is frequently reined in by caution, but I am not even sure that it is really the same concept. Or is it? Or is it in our Western world and not in other cultures? I don't know, but I sure would like to.<br/><br/>Craig, thanks for turning up here. I knew you would like that post and much of my insights build on your teaching, verified by my experiences of 630 days (at the time of this writing) of daily blogging.<br/><br/>At <a HREF=\"http://manessinger.com/2008/02/500-half-of-it-dearie.html\" REL=\"nofollow\">#500</a>, Ted asked me \"<i>And if there's one thing that you now know better than you ever imagined you would when you posted #1... Can you share it so we will know it too?</i>\"<br/><br/>Yes, there is one. Actually there's more than one, but that's it for now: making good images is not bound to be in a certain place, having a certain camera, having leisure and most certainly not from worrying about making good images. It comes from making images. <br/><br/>Thanks for being here."
