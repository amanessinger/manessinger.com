It's bringing me together with some distinguished neuro and psychological researchers who are delving into the source of creativity. And simultaneously I'm reading and interviewing some philosophers and art theorists who come at the topic from a qualitative as opposed to a quantitative direction. <br/><br/>It was the ancient Greeks who began lengthy wonders into \"Where do ideas come from?\" And by the time I finish this article for an August fifteenth deadline... well... I should know, shouldn't I? <br/><br/>As for your essay... I am putting off reading it. I want to come to it with a more focused idea in my  mind, I can only imagine it will influence me, but I want it to be at a more inspirational moment because, after all is said and done... writers do have to produce ideas on demand. <br/><br/>And if they can be produced that way... Hmmmmm one wonders just how mystical the whole thing is, eh? <br/><br/>Stay tuned....<br/><br/>Ted"
