I finally get what you mean by that and totally agree with you.   I suppose the \"in-betweens\" are the ideas that have always drawn me, especially in city situations.  Thanks for putting a name on those ideas for me.<br/><br/>As to productivity and creativity, I think one finds one's style by being productive, one finds one's creative side by being productive -- by getting out there in the fray and \"fighting the battle\" against apathy.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for continuing to inspire me with your photography and your words!"
