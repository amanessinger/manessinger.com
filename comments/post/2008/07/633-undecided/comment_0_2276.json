    "content": "From \"Popular Photography.com\":<br/><br/>DEPTH OF FIELD<br/><br/>In principle: With a focal length of about 22mm and a field of view of almost 180 degrees at its extreme, our eyes are capable of f/3.5 at wide open. Then, only the 2 degrees in the center of the retina, an area called the fovea, is sharp. <br/><br/>In practice: This may be why shallow depth of field is so visually appealing. So use it to draw attention straight to your subject. Extreme depth or shallowness can also introduce an element of surprise to your photo.<br/><br/>See \"The Photographer's Guide to the Eye\" by Neal Matthews"
