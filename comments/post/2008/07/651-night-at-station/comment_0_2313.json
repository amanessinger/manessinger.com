    "content": "Where the heck is Saturday? Would one not know that the one day which commemorates an historic event is nowhere to be found? $%$%$!!<br/><br/>On Saturday I finally framed and hung my two original Manessinger's! I have created a gallery with almost perfect reflected northern light in an area just outside of my third floor studio and right beneath a high window which floods the off-white walls in sunlight.... With the painting and carpeting all now finished I have hung two of my favorite images - yours. They look phenomenal and they are right at eye level for everyone as they enter the space.<br/><br/>They are surrounded by my work... some of my very best and with yours centered there... Well they help make everything ROCK! It is a wonderful high ceilinged stairwell... there is a half wall separating the stairs and so the area is both wide and tall with that perfect sunlight during the day so that it now feels astonishingly elegant. <br/><br/>I'm quite proud to own those prints Andreas, they are an important part of my collection."
