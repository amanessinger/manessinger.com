    "content": "Hello Andreas,<br/><br/>Yes, this is a very lovely shot.  It evokes feelings in me of \"home at last\",  \"safety from the storm\" -- feelings along those lines.<br/><br/>When I was first out of university, I worked in Washington DC for a year.  A very small effeciency apartment, at 14th and Rhode Island, was my home there.  Although small and without a view, it was cozy and \"home\".   Your umbrella image in your building reminds me so much of my small little apartment and it's shelter from the rainy, steamy summer days in Washington.  A very lovely feeling and one that is nice to remember."
