    "content": "Yeah, the bokeh is nice. Compared to the Sigma 85/2.8 Macro, this is a much less versatile lens though. Its minimum focusing distance is more than half a meter, wide open it has enormous purple fringing when overexposing, thus there are lots of good reasons to prefer the Sigma. Otoh, when you know its restrictions, it is a fun lens to have. Still, if I had to recommend a lens in this focal range, I would always recommend the Sigma."
