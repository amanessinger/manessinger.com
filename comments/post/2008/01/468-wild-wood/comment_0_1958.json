    "content": "I think this would look better as a square. Which makes me wonder about the great photographer Paul Strand who wondered: About why an arbitrary decision of some long dead Japanese or German engineer has resulted in our determination to fit the entire world and all of its ideas into the dimensions of a 35mm frame? <br/><br/>Why do we allow these dead-men to crop all of our pictures and tyrannize the way we view truth, justice, and the Austrian way? <br/><br/>Square is also arbitrary, but in a lot of ways more geometrically sensible than the ratio that Leica commanded over half a century ago. I imagine you would particularly find exciting ways to view the slanted world in that format.<br/><br/>Incidentally everyone, there is a secret to Andreas's signature tilt: He wears one cowboy boot on his left foot, and nothing on the other. It really does allow him to view the world differently from the rest of us."
