(the first would bark \"no comment\" and the latter would insist that she never even wears makeup)... so I won't ask about the post processing.<br/><br/>But I will comment on the wonderful palette that reinforces the composition and which breaks the plane into two stories. Interesting how color paints distinct emotions. Which I think is why I find monochrome so much less interesting. <br/><br/>Nice work..."
