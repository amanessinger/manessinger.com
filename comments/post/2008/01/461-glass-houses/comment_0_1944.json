    "content": "It's kinda like that, yeah ðŸ™‚ I'm definitely glad ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Funnily enough, I've taken images the whole evening, and most of them are rubbish. Event photography is neither where I'm good at nor what really interests me. It's in a way \"mindless\". You simply react.<br/><br/>That is not completely different from what I normally do, and of course in photography we always react to something, but at least normally there is a split second of meditation, a moment where a shadow of an idea crosses my mind, a lucid instant where everything comes together and an image is there before I even press the shutter. This is often not the same image that I finally take. Composing may be re-composing from the image in my mind, the image may even have faded before I actually start composing (though much of that is unconscious these days), but fact remains, that there was this moment and that triggered me. It's called \"seeing something\".<br/><br/>In cases when I try to document, and when the events rush in, I sometimes fail to see. Well, this image at least was seen ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It was the coolest birthday party, yeah!<br/><br/>Andreas"
