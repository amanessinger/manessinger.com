I've been a fan of yours since being introduced to you on RV, in fact so much so that I found I had bookmarked your site three separate times. (Hmmm, that does say something about my memory, doesn't it?)<br/><br/>Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that your work inspires me. The fact that you keep this daily blog not only with images and comments but also a song of the day just puts my weekly photo mailing to shame. And thanks for sharing your Lensbaby shots on RV. As a beginning LB user, frustrated so often in the learning process, your shining examples keep me going.<br/><br/>Thanks so much, and congratulations on your show AND making this fantastic image as a result!"
