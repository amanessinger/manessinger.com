    "content": "Hmm ... well, in general you may be right, at least what regards so called \"Volkstümliche Musik\". There was a musical direction inspired by the Italian cantautori and the French chansonniers, but it soon turned into \"Austropop\", which was not very original by itself and most of the time not even good. André Heller is of course an exception and there are one or two others, but most of them went the easy route to lowest commercialism."
