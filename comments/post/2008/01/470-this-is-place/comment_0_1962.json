    "content": "Interesting. I find that I'm quite creative in these environments, but of course my method is very different. What guides me is almost never an intellectual idea, it's an impression of a color, of lines, something very abstract that suddenly flashes up in my mind. I should call that \"Visual Ideas\", and they are absolutely independent of my political and social preferences, thus they can turn up even in places that I otherwise wouldn't call beautiful, inspiring or only interesting.<br/><br/>The other thing is, that I have no concept of \"worthy\" or \"unworthy\" subjects. All subjects are equally neutral, and that helps as well."
