    "content": "Some time ago I set out to do shoot of the mundane and to try to make it interesting. I went to grimly typical industrial site crammed with those box, aluminum clad buildings that look put up over a weekend and that are surrounded by something that looks a little like brown dead grass. <br/><br/>There were telephone lines everywhere, and blacktopped parking lots crammed with nondescript vehicles and dumpsters. <br/><br/>I took some pictures. I came home. I through all the pictures in the trash. <br/><br/>Why can't I get an idea like your telephone pole shot? My eye will not create ideas in those places which I want to share. And yet I bet they are more about modern culture than all of the other gritty and historic, and pretty things we find. <br/><br/>When the cold breaks, I shall go back to that place. There has to be an interesting essay there. You've proven that."
