    "content": "That shot leaves ambivalent feelings. I reallly like the grainy, unsharp, watery picture and the road the winds towards the light. <br/><br/>But I'm always annoyed by that bright flare on the right hand side. It makes me kind of slip while enjoying the rest of the photo - it's so distracting."
