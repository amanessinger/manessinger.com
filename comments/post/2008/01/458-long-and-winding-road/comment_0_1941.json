The lensbaby is so handy in its application (you have tilt, shift, swing, and rise in your pocket... don't get that from just any lensðŸ™‚ that I have deliberated about buying one for some time. I have a more cumbersome setup to do these things with a dslr, but its not very simple to setup or use in the field."
