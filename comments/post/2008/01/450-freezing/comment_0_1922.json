I’m sitting here lunching at The Lancaster Brewery, happily alone with a big Rueben  sandwich, a glass of Arnold Palmer, and my laptop on this Indian Summer day. It’s all delicious and flavored by a talk-radio show peppering through my earpods.  Hey, what a way to get away from the office and travel a quarter of the way around the globe. <br/><br/>On my screen’s a (literally cool) S curve of what? Asphalt popping out of a semi frozen lake shore? Does the “semi” part of that mean that the Indians have also lugged some summer back to Austria? I’m particularly intrigued by the way you’ve managed to puddle the setting sun into both of the spoon cups of your S. And the cool blues of winter day slash through those puddles of gold almost as if they writhed into place while you stood and directed. <br/><br/>Technically it’s a nifty interplay of shape and texture Andreas. Thoughtfully it’s a poster for a movie called, “Nostalgia” which balances the warm  memories  of an ending  day with the surge of a frostily impending  night. <br/><br/>How often your images work on many levels. You’ve grown so comfortable with your style and machinery that we can look through as well as at much of what you do, enjoying not just what you take images of, but what you make images about. <br/><br/>Thanks…."
