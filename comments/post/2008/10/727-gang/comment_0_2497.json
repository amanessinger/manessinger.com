    "content": "Thanks ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Yes, I'm pretty satisfied with this image. Not in all aspects, but it certainly works, and I guess that's foremost a result of these incredible poses. These bicycles are way COOL ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The other thing that works is the white vignetting. I tried dark (painting in black on a neutral Soft Light layer) and it was not really wrong, but then I had the idea to try inverting it and it was a revelation. These bikes need a comics style! Well, and that's how it came together ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Thanks again."
