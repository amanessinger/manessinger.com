If what photographic genius means is both an ability to perceive, then execute an idea in ways that resonate beyond the literal meaning of an image. <br/><br/>As you know, I'm transfixed by your bicycle photos. They seem like so many dances, each with its own soloists and in this case... company. <br/><br/>And I'd like to plagiarize your idea here. The theme seems so effortless in you images that increasingly I find myself taking bicycle pictures. But they remain pictures... snapshots. Where yours are images that  dance, mine clump about, looking not so much like dancers but rather like vagrants or random street debris. <br/><br/>Yes, this will be a very successful book, series of calendars, and illustration for poems."
