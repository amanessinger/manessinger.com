No, that's not what is so shocking. <br/><br/>What makes me breathless, is the deep grief of the ten thousands who have come to visit the place where he died (well, actually places, so fast was he), have stood in line for hours to see him laid out, who have been at the funeral. What shocks me is that they treat him like a benevolent monarch, a bringer of peace, a truly great man. And this although he was nothing of that, least of all a man of peace. JÃ¶rg Haider was a malevolent, destructive egoist, a big spender of our money, a nepotist of the worst kind, always bordering legality, routinely defying our constitution and its institutions.<br/><br/>But they love him. Normal, honest people love him. THAT's what I don't get!"
