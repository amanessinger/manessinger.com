    "content": "just to pick out two expressions of your rant: \"Carinthian-born thinking man\" and \"to agitate the stupid against the weak\"<br/><br/>For any thinking man a certain kind of politicians will always mean utter grief. Unfortunately it is only too easy to come up with an endless row of disgusting politicians that exerted some fascination, the less you want to think the easier to fall for this kind of false charisma. As a born and bred bavarian, socialized in the time of the famous Franz-Josef Strauss I know what I am speaking about. And I have to admit that I myself had fallen to this.<br/><br/>And \"to agitate the stupid against the weak\" - that is exactly what extremists are doing, more or less openly all over the world. In Sri Lanka government's fight against the Tamils it is exactly this mechanism. What causes utmost bewilderment among the thinking ones is that this strategy is so widely accepted."
