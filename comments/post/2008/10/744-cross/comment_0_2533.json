The crucifix for me is lost in the noise of the scene, particularly the glass. It is a distraction which pulls me from the story thread. And I don't think it's remedial unless you try an entirely different crop. <br/><br/>Of course, if this was anyone else's image it'd be a ten, for you... I give it a six. Usually when there's a technical distraction I just pass the image by. But since you don't have technical distractions... well, this baby stands out... <br/><br/>Ah well, I'm sure that you'll just go and turn out a dozen dazzlers over the next days which will once again make me think about trading in my camera for a clarinet. Sigh..."
