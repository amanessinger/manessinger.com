The damage is done, political culture has changed, and I think that those kinds of political behavior that were unknown to Austria before him, will stay. He has shown that it is possible to defy the constitution, to negate the supreme court, to agitate the stupid against the weak - and to come away with it. This is his legacy and it will stay with us for a long time.<br/><br/>And it's not only Austria. Silvio Berlusconi is a populist, in a way Nicolas Sarkozy is, Ronald Reagan was, George Bush certainly is, and so is Vladimir Putin, to name only the most prominent. It has become very fashionable to present simple, enticing and wrong solutions for the challenges of our complex old world."
