    "content": "Yes, the damage is certainly done. Not only by Haider but - as you already pointed out - by a whole crowd of equally opportunistic and populistic politicans. But there might be one reason to think that his death could change things for good: he certainly won't contribute more to the erosion of political culture.<br/><br/>Sorry, I don't want to sound harsh. But the guy had an alcohol level of nearly 2 promilles and was speeding heavily! Laws of biology, of physics? Nah, not for me! He was asking for it. Sorry.<br/><br/>Now it really starts worrying me that his death seems to be starting to be cloaked in conspiracy theories and even takes on forms of mass hysteria. JÃ¶rg Haider as a martyr... Brr. Scary thought.<br/><br/>Or is that a false impression from a couple of thousand kilometers away?"
