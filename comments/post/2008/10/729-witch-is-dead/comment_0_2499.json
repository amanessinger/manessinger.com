    "content": "I noticed his death over the weekend in Finnish news as well. It's quite telling of his impact on European politics that his death was noted in multiple medias very quickly.<br/><br/>I then started to wait for your reaction to the news, since your dislike of his politics was quite apparent. I, for one, am glad that at least one charismatic right-wing politician is out of the game.<br/><br/>On the pictures, they're an interesting choice. I'd first think a gloomier fog shot would be more fitting for a post about death. But in this case I don't think you want to convey sadness etc. so much as a certain sense of hope and optimism that the sun brings to the colors. Very fitting."
