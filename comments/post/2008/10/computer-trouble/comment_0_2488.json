Well, not too worry, honestly... reeeeely.... I did not smirk even a tiny tiny tiny bit. Nope... nor did i gig (a gig is a very small part of a giggle), nor make any chortling sound. Nope.. nope... just shuddered along with you and thanked The Lord Of The CPUs thatit wasn't my story but one I was just reading all of that here on the monitor of my MacBook Pro... <br/><br/>Of course I feel in no way smugly superior... well... not smugly exactly... Um... and not EXACTLY superior. No, just an ordinary kind of guy who's reading this on the monitor of his MACBOOK PRO.... <br/><br/>Okay... your turn... remember the problems I had a few months back with the predecessor of this machine that's under my typing fingers? There may not be a God, but something sure does distribute enough computer-pain for us all, huh?<br/><br/>Instead of these babies, maybe we should buy us a couple of high tech abacuses?"
