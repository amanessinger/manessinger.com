    "content": "I MUCH prefer numbers 2 and 3 of this series and regret that they were not held to be presented as images of the day. The second is a masterpiece of palette presented with your signature tilt. The blue corner bookmarks which contain and constrain the gold/yellow middle is a terrific warm/cool accomplishment. <br/><br/>And Number three is fiery hot. The seamless way you have captured an impossible pallet through ingenious PP is in itself a lesson for a workshop for which you should be paid a bundle of whatever currency remains valuable after we all jump this present financial chasm."
