It seems like just yesterday when you celebrated the FIRST birthday of your blog.<br/><br/>I'm thoroughly amazed that you've managed to post an image a day for two years.  It's true dedication and you've inspired me with you passion and with the quality of your photography.<br/><br/>Looking forward to seeing all that you do in another year -- and looking forward to seeing you in Savannah, GA USA in 2009!!"
