    "content": "Recently I have been using a lens borrowed from a friend. As you know I lean heavily toward wide glass. But the borrowed lens is the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens. The image stabilization is wonderful. But it has a problem, one out of perhaps seven times the interface with the auto focus is imperfect and the results aren'r quite discoverable until I get it back onto the monitor screen. <br/><br/>But I understand you are looking at Nikor lenses. The results I've had, particularly using the 300mm as a portrait lens is powerfully rewarding. And the IS gives me almost a full two stops of hand holdable usefulness. <br/><br/>I'm tempted to buy the long lens, especially given the weight. But since my friend no longer seems to take pictures, I have almost spontaneous use of the thing... but that word \"almost\" is a rather large one. <br/><br/>As you know, I rarely use a tripod, but given your work habits... the longest lens sounds VERY attractive.  And given what it will do re. compression and DOF... well, if you are looking for a fresh eye.... There's a lot to be said about going to the far pole, no? The only worry I'd have in with the Sigma 150-500/5.0-6.3 is the way light could bounce around inside of that barrel. Have you seen the contrast tests? Under oblique light? And if you have to shut down at all to max out sharpness... well even with a tripod - this could be an, um, handful."
