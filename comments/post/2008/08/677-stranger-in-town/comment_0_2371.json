Small surprise with the German re-juveniled Nazis now holding a substantial fraction of the seats in one of the German local parliaments. If you ever want to spoil your day, just search for NPD at youtube or in recent news articles.<br/><br/>Ted, we can discuss semantics for a long time, however, I personally have a very simple (maybe naive) definition of \"far right\". For me \"far right\" describes a state of mind and action that violates the spirit of our constitution and consequently fundamental human rights. And yes, sometimes I think politics becomes a circle with \"far right\" being nearly indistinguishable from \"far left\"."
