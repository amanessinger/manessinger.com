    "content": "Andreas, I do fully understand your emotions. Living in bavaria I have more than a full share of politicians that rise only on evoking the most evil emotions, and fear/envy/hate of foreigners is among those. And you are right, JÃ¶rg Haider is one of the worst exponents of those, the more so because he is so charismatic. <br/><br/>You don't even have to be left to see that disdain of foreigners as something awful - beyond all emotions pro or con foreigners in our societies it would be sufficient to recognize that our states would be helpless without their contribution in form of labor force as well as taxes.<br/><br/>Besides this, the picture is brilliant and the color of the scarf is just the right one for this depiction, vivid enough to draw attention, reserved enough to sublimely point at the problem. Great."
