    "content": "I am fascinated by the mix that goes into the European ideological stew. As I recall, the word \"NAZI\" stood for National Socialism. And there are many in my country who think that \"Left\" politically certainly means, socialist. Ditto the fascist movements which were also central/big government/collectivist/socialist movements and were, until the war revealed the disgusting nature of their ethnic purity apparatus to the West... well they were the darlings of the Leftist movements and leadership here in the states. <br/><br/>In fact, as I recall, it was only their differences with Moscow over the definition of national socialist as opposed to international socialist identity that resulted in Stalin relegating the fascist/Nazi movements to some sort of right-wing hell. All were proudly red shirt before that schism. <br/><br/>But apparently the question of nationalism is what is most defining of the various political poles for Europeans, where in the US, nationalism is understood very differently... largely because here national identity is not ethnically based. In Europe, nationalism begins with ethnic identity, a concept that is hard for Americans to totally grasp. Here, any strong ethnic identity is quickly understood as racism, something which has caused us some serious problems over the centuries.<br/><br/>Oh well, these are the differences which are much larger than nuance when we live amongst them, eh?"
