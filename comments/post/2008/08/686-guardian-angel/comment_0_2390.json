    "content": "Wonderful work, haunting. As for the PP.... I am increasingly convinced that photographic art is a process consisting of an observation at the time of shutter release and discovery in PP. Thus art is a concept and that concept involves a process...  which also means that I no longer think that epiphany is an instantaneous moment when the stars explode and Archimedes runs naked down the streets screaming, \"Eureka!\". <br/><br/>Oh, perhaps in geological time the process happens in an instant, but in reality it can happen in hours or over days don't you think? <br/><br/>I also think that there are artists who want to pretend that epiphany is like taking the gods' dictation. That they are such geniuses that they understood the one true route to masterpiece and that it happens to them all the time in instantaneous euphoria. Again, I wonder if you agree. I don't. You're right I think that the concept involves releasing the angel from the stone. <br/><br/>And this angel is wonderful... although whether it pees on my tongue... Hmmmm... got to think on that Emma ðŸ™‚"
