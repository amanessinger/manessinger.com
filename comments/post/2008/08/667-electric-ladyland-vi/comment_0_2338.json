You seem to have a natural ability to isolate your subjects, and the lens accentuates that in a very pleasing way.<br/><br/>This is definitely something that I need to work on, since I'm a wide angle addict whose images always seem a bit too cluttered. So I'm very glad to absorb what I can from looking at your experiments and spending some time thinking about what you've done."
