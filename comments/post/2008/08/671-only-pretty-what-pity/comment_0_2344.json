The \"dead\" category was excellent. <br/><br/>Here in Finland we have a landscape painter in whose works I don't see even beauty, just cliches, but he sells a lot. I think that some use those paintings as furnishing items - they don't disturb in any way, and certainly you don't much notice them on walls."
