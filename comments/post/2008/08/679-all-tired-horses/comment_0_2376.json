    "content": "You have nudged me to take bicycle images. And I still have not found ONE that resonates in any way. You have a stunning ability to find form, shape, and character in these things. This has got to be an important book Andreas... but not now... nope... keep seeing these things. And continue to use them to develop a sense of place and artifact.<br/><br/>I can see you doing ten years of images then going back and collecting the images for that book... some even with people actually ON the bicycles... accentuating your use of them as a stand-in for the  existence of people in the urban concept."
