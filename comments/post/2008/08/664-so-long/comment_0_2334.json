    "content": "On the square... Yeah... Paul Strand once wrote something like, \"I resent the tyranny of the 35mm frame... the world is never framed so precisely.\" Besides, the 35mm frame is simply an accident of engineering by some Leica guy who, as you point out, I resent. <br/><br/>One thing though, while when using the square, I do discover in the post processing, however I frequently recognize that an image will conform wonderfully to the square as I capture the image in the wild. Technically a nice thing about the square is that you can exploit the sweet spot in the very center of you lens.. and compose by centering. The rule of third composition does force us to place the subject off-center which is not the area that those engineers designed to be max re. lens performance."
