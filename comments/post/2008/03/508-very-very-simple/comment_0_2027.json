How old do you think the builders/designers of the houses/roads in picture one were? Maybe forty? Forty five? And so these forty something people have crowded out all of the forty somethings of today who have important ideas about building/designing. <br/><br/>Why do we accept this tyranny, even clot together to protect it and to enforce their edicts upon our own peers? We are doing their work for them whenever we join up with the ideas of a preservationist group. Surely there must be a lot of people today who have fresh, smart, important ideas? Why is it that once a structure goes up that it is somehow immoral to consider reusing that pad upon which it sits? <br/><br/>As children we were promised cities of crystal and chrome. We were teased with ideas of  flying cars and astonishing use of space. But instead they cannot be constructed where the people are because the kids who once were like us will not allow any two bricks already joined ... to be broken apart. <br/><br/>And that's what I think as I look at your peon to posterity. And I shudder at the tyranny of those long dead forty somethings who were better than us in only one sense... They do not live now.<br/><br/>Hmmmm?"
