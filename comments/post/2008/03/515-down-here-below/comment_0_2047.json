When I retrieved the package and brought the images into Bridge... could I, without cropping or enhancement display any of them as.. mine? If not mine, whose? <br/><br/>The results of camera tossing still assume that \"place\" was chosen by the \"artist\" so there's still some subjective component of the final image. Add in time and I suppose the act of choosing one out of a burst of images all add up to an artistic communication. Or do they? <br/><br/>Yeah, this is a fascinating image. But am I the one who creates art when the image is random? And what is then your role? <br/><br/>Too deep for me...."
