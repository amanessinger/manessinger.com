    "content": "The more you go random, the more you have to rely on automatic repetition and numbers. <br/><br/>It's clear, your extreme of the camera shipped randomly around, randomly triggered, taking completely random images, would produce pictures that you could hardly claim as your's, and the art portion of the whole act would shift into the performance itself, i.e. what could be considered art and in fact would so, albeit only by a tiny minority, is the act of packing a camera into a box, randomly shipping it, retrieving the images and claiming it art. That's a tad self-referential, but contemporary art is frequently like that.<br/><br/>In my case things were comparably controlled, not much was random here. I wanted an image like that, I have checked in between, have made corrections to the way I held the monopod, and I stopped doing so when I had a sufficient result. Technically that's not much different from trying the same shot  again because you've not been able to hold it at a low shutter speed.<br/><br/>Just to make sure, this is not an excuse. In fact I think the idea with the randomly shipped camera is  great and I would love to try it, it is only not very practical. Nevertheless, I would maybe not exactly claim the images mine, but I would sure claim the act my art."
