I just bought a Gorilla Pod and can now picture myself, camera mounted on at ground level or even the back of my wheelchair, remote shutter release in hand snapping images from viewpoints I'd never imagined possible.  Now if it would just stop snowing and warm up a bit, I'd be all set.   Thanks for sharing this one Andreas."
