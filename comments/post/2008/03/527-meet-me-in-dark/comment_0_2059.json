I think the blue mists sworling about the cave-boys careens around most trenchantly in my imagination. But this last is, as Mari says, a trick with color which slams into my thoughts. It is a manly picture Andreas... not subtle girlie tendrils, or teasie pastels.... It is a man's punch of color onto pixels and composed to make me try pattern after pattern atop it looking for a whole bunch of meanings.<br/><br/>In the blue piece, the story invoked is yours, in this piece, the final tale I settle upon will be mine. Interesting that you can go from one to another so effortlessly. <br/><br/>Okay... I shall return to lurking...<br/><br/>Ted"
