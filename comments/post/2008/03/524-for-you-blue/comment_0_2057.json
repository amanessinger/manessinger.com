    "content": "Wonderful group of images here Andreas. I am especially partial to the awesome perspective and feeling of disconnect with the escalator, and the images of the swimming hole.<br/><br/>It always amazes me how your work can bend from image to the next from techo to organic. And its not just in the subject matter, though it often helps. Your compositions just seem to lean one way or the other, and, yes, sometimes in-between. My point is that there are always such fine delineations in your work. It's so interesting to see."
