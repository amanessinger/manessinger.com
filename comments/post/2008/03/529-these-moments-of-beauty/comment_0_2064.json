    "content": "Which is my point. There are devices that the artist uses to pull people through their portals to consider their thoughts and feelings. <br/><br/>Sure it takes craft to achieve the \"WOW!\"  But if the only intent is the \"WOW!\" If there is nothing else there beyond the portal... then there is only craft... no art. <br/><br/>My point is that by itself, <b><i>the illustration of beauty is one type of craft... it is NOT art!</b></i><br/><br/> If it is one of those devices, as you note, that leads the viewer into a CO-mmunication, an interaction with your thoughts... then it is a prelude to art. <br/><br/>Of course I no more want to define beauty than I do art. I'm just sayin' that it can be one necessary but not a sufficient condition to making art.<br/><br/>A \"WOW!\" alone is like... like... an entirely convincingly seductive  transvestite to a heterosexual guy. Um, sort of an, er, ... downer.<br/><br/>Hmm... thinking about that example... I wonder if it is possible that craft represented as art might even be fraud. Imagine, someone  presenting the collected works of say John Coltrane as the artistic equivalent of the Greatest Hits of Donnie Osmond."
