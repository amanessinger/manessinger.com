Sometimes I do, most of the time not. What I do is what I said: I try to express my own feelings, I try to resolve tension, I try to ...<br/><br/>Those things. I don't try to produce beauty. It may be a by-product. So far for me and my intentions. <br/><br/>What I want from you is recognition of my intentions. I want to be understood. What we do here is communication, and like in all kinds of communication, my efforts are wasted when you don't listen. But in order to make people listen, they need some form of appeal. \"Wow\" may help tremendously in that regard, but the \"Wow\" need not come from beauty. It may, but shock can do as well, as can other qualities.<br/><br/>Are we any nearer now :-?"
