After all, the sky has no more relation to my future than the intermingling of Venus with Uranus, or the bumps on my noggin. Yet we do it... you do it here. It is a latch with which you invite us to consider a future... which is itself what? Spooky? Unsettled? Doom ridden? The future Horatio lies not in the stars, but in ourselves.<br/><br/>Oh BTW... I see the images sold on the website up there on the left of your blogsite are offered generally at 250 Euros? Hmmmmm... I think George Bush's ineptitude is pricing you way out of the American market. Maybe you should reduce them to 5 Euros... that'd make them affordable to Americans... at least for the next week or so...."
