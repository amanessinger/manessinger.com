    "content": "Yes, the &quot;grain&quot; quality of these Nikons is outstanding, but what really fascinates me is the effect that deliberately using the highest possible ISO value has on my shooting. It makes for a very relaxed style. <br/><br/>I don&#39;t have to worry about getting the image at all, don&#39;t have to worry about being able to hold it. Restricting myself to B&amp;W adds even more freedom, because blown highlights, a problem that you frequently have in street photography at night, suddenly becomes largely irrelevant. Try it, it&#39;s a funny experience."
