I have Nikon's \"Active D-Lighting\" enabled though, and that, together with 14-bit RAW, should compress the dynamic range a bit, at least that's the theory.<br/><br/>In general, underexposing normally does the trick as well, probably at the expense of shadows. Otoh, there are not many shadows anyway ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I guess even a polarizer may help. One would have to try."
