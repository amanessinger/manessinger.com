    "content": "Thanks ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>What I have is the \"Standard\" version, not \"Elite\". \"Elite\" is only needed for full frame cameras and middle format. Should I really buy the D700 anytime (does not look like it at the moment), then I'd need to upgrade. This way it was only â‚¬150 including taxes. Still, that would be much for a noise filter.<br/><br/>It is no noise filter though. It's a RAW converter, and it is a better RAW converter than Adobe Camera RAW. And that by a margin. Especially in high ISO color images I like the way it presents noise. It simply looks good to me."
