Thus I have neither an idea of the original question nor the state of the discussion. In fact I can't remember having seen this distinction in connection with photography any time before. <br/><br/>I guess it is pretty clear what cinematic could mean. It's something that visualizes a moment (decsive? not necessarily) in a story. <a HREF=\"http://ishotmyselftheydidtoo.blogspot.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">Aaron Hobson's work</a> is a fine example, see also his <a HREF=\"http://aaronhobson.com/\" REL=\"nofollow\">portfolio site</a>, and of course someone like <a HREF=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Crewdson\" REL=\"nofollow\">Gregory Crewdson</a>.<br/><br/>Theatrical? No idea what a theatrical image would be. Certainly no abstrat either, huh?<br/><br/>Do we need a story? Well, I guess we do. Not much of it, a hint is enough, and I think that the most successful cinematic images start different stories in different viewer's heads, a certain vagueness and openness being part of the quality. Thus it would not be a real story but a strong trigger to make one up.<br/><br/>Regarding Andrew Wyeth and Jackson Pollock, yes, I think that's mostly correct. Of course abstracts can trigger the invention of a story, but if they do so, they certainly won't do it in a majority of viewers. Yes, if anything of that makes any sense, then Wyeth is mostly cinematic (or maybe theatrical, whatever the distinction would mean) and Pollock or Kandinsky are mostly not."
