    "content": "Hmmmm... (suspicious look on my face)... well perhaps DXO does a good jog at overcoming noise. As for the argument that it's more than a noise filter... Perhaps I need to try the demo. However That 10 euros still translates into a healthy dollar number. <br/><br/>But... but... my more cosmic questions remain... (1) What is the distinction between a cinematic image and a theatrical image. (2) How distinguishes them as a class from other forms of fine art photography? Do each of them imply that a story is presented? Or that a story arc is mounted? <br/><br/>Do all \"Decisive Moment\" images fall into one or the other of those categories? May any \"scenic\" image fall into one of those categories? Are abstracts automatically excluded?  I'm guessing that Andrew Wyeth paintings fall into the cinematic-theatrical school, but Jackson Pollack wouldn't be allowed in the door? <br/><br/>Hmmmmm...... ?"
