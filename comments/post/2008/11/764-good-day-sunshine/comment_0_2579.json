    "content": "Andreas,<br/><br/>  Lovely shots this weekend - thanks!<br/><br/>  When trying to merge handheld shots into HDRs, I've found that Photoshop does a far, far better job than Photomatix at aligning slightly misaligned images. It takes several minutes longer but it's worth the wait. My default HDR workflow for handheld is now to merge in Photoshop, save as a .HDR file then pull this into Photomatix for tone mapping.<br/><br/>Dave Wilson"
