At 10:00 PM EST (Eastern Standard Time), the results will start pouring in because the polls in California close at 7 PM Pacific time, some 3 hours behind.<br/><br/>Although I despise politics, it looks to be a historic time should Obama win.<br/><br/>I'm am sitting quietly, surfing blogs, television silent. I'll find out in the morning who won."
