    "content": "We are in general agreement....<br/><br/>Yes there are political systems and economic systems. I think of them as two parallel lines going from left to right. The top one, political, starts at the far left with perfect democracy and ends at the far right at a totalitarian pole. <br/><br/>The Lower line, economic, starts at the left with pure markets and ends at the right with total central planning. <br/><br/>Each of us lives in a bubble which combines two points on those lines. <br/><br/>The libertarians define all of this so wickedly...<br/><br/>Conservatives: Want the government out of your wallet but into your bedroom.<br/><br/>Liberals: Want the government out of your bedroom but into your wallet.<br/><br/>Libertarians: Want the government out of each.<br/><br/>Neither is theory of government, eh?"
