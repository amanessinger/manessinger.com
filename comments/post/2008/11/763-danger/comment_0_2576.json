    "content": "I share your concern re. the fragility of Democracy. Oddly it usually topples from the left (National Socialism re. Italy, NAZIs, Russian Leninism.... arrrgh!) and we have had a capture of almost all of the institutions of government here in the US recently by the very far part of the centrist left in the US. Of course they were handed their opportunity by the inability of the Bush/Republican inability to govern. <br/><br/>Still, we have not seen the cult of the personality quite so well distilled out since the 1930s/40s here in the US. Nor have we ever elected anyone to the Presidency with such a thin résumé, nor a candidacy based upon little more than an unexplained sense of hope/change. <br/><br/>The undoubted financial emergency will give the new government an opportunity to seize sweeping powers almost immediately... so, like you, I am aware that Spain, Germany, and Italy were all quite democratic when a strongman from the left (the left by every standard which an American understands) strode to the top. <br/><br/>There is a vacuum of power  and barely four points separating the looser from victor in the hotly contested political race in this country, and we all know what nature abhors. However, most of the real power centralizations in the last hundred years have come about as a result of strong support from the military. And when the left fails to have it, then we have the Latin American models to give us pause as the \"Defense\" forces act to \"stabilize\" a perceived threat to themselves. Already there are Democrats discussing a 25-40% cut in the military budget here in the US. <br/><br/>Good thing or bad? Hmmmmm.... That depends if it's sound politics to piss off brawny men with guns,eh? <br/><br/>Hope is often followed by uncertainty, eh? And the stage after that?"
