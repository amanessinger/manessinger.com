Our day time temperatures are already around 30ÂºC and it's extremely dry. Not a good combination due to the likelihood of bushfires.\nThis photo fascinates me in that there is no fence on top of the wall. Here, something like this would have not only a high fence but also a myriad signs warning people of the danger which would render the scene completely ugly. I guess the government over here wants to keep all the idiots in the gene pool by keeping them safe from themselves."
