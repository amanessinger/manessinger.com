I think there's been a growth in your photography and to me it's also interesting seeing which title you match up with the photos and to read some of you thoughts on it all.  I especially enjoy those occasions you share some technical info or fact about a camera, lens, software or process. \n\nI try every once in a while to leave a comment here about one thing or another.  No matter what I may say in the comments I leave, it comes down to simply saying I appreciate what you share and thank-you!."
