Unfortunately a very large number of people - maybe a large majority in most countries - still don't give a toss about what goes on even in their neighbouring countries let alone in the Rwandas of this world and use these amazing tools for the most mundane and  self-absorbing purposes. It never ceases to amaze me how little some people know and how little they care. They know what's happened in the latest big bother episode or whatever, or what starlet is doing what and what she had for dinner last night, but wouldn't have a clue where Rwanda is or that there was genocide there 20 years ago.  But I digress! NIce reflection and nice composition!"
