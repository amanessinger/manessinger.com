    "content": "Hello Andreas,\n\nthis picture is a wonderful \"memento mori\". \n\nMy wife an I like the atmossphere at the famous old Jewish Jewish cemetery in Prague, if it would'nt be so overcrowded byhordes of tourists \"nowadays\". \"Nowadays\" means since about 24 years, since the collaps of the communistic regime in the former Czechoslovakia. I think, I have been two times before 1989  in Prague, visiting the old Jewish cemetery. The morbid \"charme\" of Prague on a cold foggy November day there, the cemetery...impressive and memorable. And then at the Staranov√° synagoga you could get the feeling, Franz Kafka will come around the corner just now.\n\nI have not been  at the Jewish part of the central cemetery in Vienna until now, but your pictures will motivate me, to go there.\n\nFurthermore I am asking, wether you are also printing your pictures, especially the above one, and selling it. If yes, give me an information about the possibilities and the costs. I can give you my address in Vienna or I can also pick it up personally, no problem:\n\nAbout the size? I don't know yet. I have to check it in our flat, I want to mat and frame it and would give your picture a prominent place.\n\nThank you in advance for a reply.\n\nBest regards from Hungary\n\nFranz"
