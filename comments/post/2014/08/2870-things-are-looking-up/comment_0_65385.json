    "content": "I bought a 6\" Kobo some time back (a perfect size as it would easily fit in my pocket) and since then I have been reading far more than before. As you say, it is the fact that no matter where I am, I have my phone at the very least which grants me far more opportunities to read. Unfortunately I lost my Kobo on a recent trip to California but have been using my phone since. Still, I plan to buy a Kindle soon. I found out they too have a 6\" version which I find perfect.\nI use goodreads.com to keep track of what I read and what I will read next though admittedly I am not too pedantic about keeping it up to date but perhaps this is a site you might like. They have useful apps for mobile devices and because they were bought out by Amazon I believe they are accessible from some Kindles. I use Goodreads mostly to discover new books and read reviews but it is a pretty good site for creating lists too."
