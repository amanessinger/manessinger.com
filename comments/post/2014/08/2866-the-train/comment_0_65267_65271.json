    "content": "Yeah, I agree: of all content markets the movie market is in worst shape. \n\nThere is one of my favorite movies of all time, Franco Brusati's \"Dimenticare Venezia\" (\"To Forget Venice\"). You can't buy it in any language but Italian (which I don't speak). I had a perfectly synchronized German version, recorded on Video 2000 in 1984 though. That's the same version that was shown in our cinemas. It's gone. Completely lost.\n\nAnother example is Bertrand Tavernier's masterful pre-revolution movie \"Que la fete commence\". I've seen it in German, bought it much later via Amazon.fr on DVD and, voil√†, the DVD has all languages as long as you want French. It's annoying."
