Since converting to e-books I have read far more and I've also found that using the Goodreads web site has opened me up to titles and authors I may not have considered otherwise. The same goes for Spotify where music is concerned. Now if only there was a decent movie streaming equivalent which includes all the extras you get on DVDs I would definitely have a lot of available shelf space."
