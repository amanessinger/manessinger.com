    "content": "I too have that lens, got it with the GM1, and am very happy with the sharpness and compactness. I have put the lens on my OMD too and it looks kinda small for that body, but it really makes for a compact system. With the lens on the GM1 it is pocketable (if you have a moderately big pocket and do not mind a bit of a bulge). Very happy so far and as you mentioned it has gotten good reviews."
