    "content": "Sometimes - but not always - taking photographs can help to cope with stress, but I have found out that if I try to use photography as a medicine, it doesn't work; one has to take photographs for the simple reason of taking photographs, and perhaps for the reason that sometimes this allows you to see how the world looks like in a photograph.\n\nIn any case, I can well understand why the wall caught your interest. It is good."
