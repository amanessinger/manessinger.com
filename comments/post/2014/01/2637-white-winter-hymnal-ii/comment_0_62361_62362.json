Head over to <a href=\"http://www.dslr-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?f=110&order=desc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">DSLR-Forum.de</a> and wait for a while. Most people try to go for a price slightly higher, around 550, though normally with a much lower shutter count than my 17000. Also you'd normally be able to negotiate a lower price. The same on <a href=\"http://www.ebay.de/sch/Digitalkameras-/31388/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=olympus+om-d+e-m5&LH_Complete=1&rt=nc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eBay</a>. You'll see everything between 470â‚¬ and 530â‚¬, depending on wear. Crazy, but a good time to buy a good camera ðŸ™‚"
