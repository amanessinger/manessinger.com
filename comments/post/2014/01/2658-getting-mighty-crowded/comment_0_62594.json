    "content": "I enjoy using Amazon Cloud Player to store, stream and/or download my music when I want to. Even though it is restricted to MP3 purchases and has a limit of 250 songs for 5GB. However, this service is free from Amazon. Here in the US you can buy enough storage on Amazon for $24.99 for the year to store 250,000 songs! If you can accept MP3 quality then it is a better option then having to purchase and store the CDs. Finally, you can also import from your own CDs to the cloud making it an even more cost effective\noption."
