It also suits me not to have CDs to store on shelves or in drawers. I don't feel the need to own things like music. Or art. Or movies. Or books. Having said that, there was a time when that seemed important to me but I don't remember why. My son (18) likes to own books and movies and music. He likes holding them in his hands, he likes seeing them on shelves, he likes that they are there. Perhaps those were my reasons too once upon a time but I really don't remember, nor do I see the point in owning this kind of thing anymore."
