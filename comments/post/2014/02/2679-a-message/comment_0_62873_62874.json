What I do, currently depends on Last.FM. Of course I could write a Spotify plugin myself (and plugins for all the other popular music players that people may want to use) and get rid of the man in the middle, but still, I don't see people paying for such a service. I may be wrong though.</li>\n <li>This is Austria. Fundraising via Kickstarter would probably collide with our buerocracy. Even thinking of it hurts ðŸ˜„</li>\n</ul>"
