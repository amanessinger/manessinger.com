    "content": "Organizing is not my primary concern. It's losing my history, losing associations. I want to be able to look at some kind of \"record\" from the past and be able to remember what I did when I heard it, who I was with, what we drank and what we talked about. That's the kind of thing.\n\nLast.FM will not solve that long-term problem, but routing my data from Spotify to them at least solves the problem to get it out of Spotify. I'll have to get it out of Last.FM as well, but that seems to be easy via their feeds. In the end I'll need my own programs and database."
