Still, being able to look up related artists and following up on Spotify suggestions (not often good but I think it's learning), does help in the discovery of new music.\n\nWhat you say about exporting playlists etc. is a valid point. I can see some people would invest a lot of time and effort creating such playlists and organising their music and then end up losing it all when the company goes bust or a much better product comes on the market. The thing is, I don't see physical discs (CD or even DVD â€“ Blu ray or standard) continuing to be available for ever. Eventually, music and movies will only be available via a service. Andreas, perhaps there's an idea for an app here. A service where you create your playlists etc. and which then allows you to export them to selected services such as Spotify and Netflix ðŸ™‚\n\nAnyway, enjoy your subscription. Seeing as you are more of a music lover than I am, I will look forward to reading about your experience."
