    "content": "I definitely think that photoblogs are going out of style.  With sites such as 500px, Flickr, Facebook, Google+, and DeviantArt there is less and less a need for a photoblog.  On my photography Facebook page I used to share links to my blog page to promote my images.  My audience interaction was abysmal.  Then I started uploading directly to Facebook with links back to my blog and my interactions, relatively speaking, increased dramatically.  I hate the fact that I have to upload directly to Facebook due to their EULA, but if I don't I don't get any response.\n\nAdditionally, I rarely visit your blog proper.  I've subscribed to your blog via RSS along with several other photographers, so don't discount that audience because I'm not sure if those are included in those Google Analytics numbers."
