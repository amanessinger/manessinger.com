For me, not so much, too many one word comments or prefabricated badges around. And f***book - I just post thumbnails there, but I do not use it actively any more. Their business model and assumed relationship with certain surveillance agencies is nothing I'd like to feed. And what's the value of 1/10s glances on my images there? I guess it's not much different from snapchat.\n\nStubbornness is probably my explanation too, why I still blog. My own website, my blog gives me a platform to show my images to people who are really interested. For that and them, I care."
