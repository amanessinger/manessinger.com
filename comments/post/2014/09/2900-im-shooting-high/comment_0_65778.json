    "content": "Are blogs going out of favour? That's a tough question. I suspect some people are doing that kind of research and I'm sure there would be some stats somewhere. I still read blogs but I will admit I have not introduced a new blog to my list in years. And if all the bloggers I follow were to stop, I would not go looking for new blogs. Why? Well I'm not sure. I do find myself less and less on the web these days. I tend to use the Internet purely when I have a specific question in mind or some specific task I need to do. Blogs for me are a casual read, a way of keeping up with the lives of virtual friends I've never met. My own blog is far too hit-and-miss in terms of postings and I've never had more than a dozen visitors a day but then again I've never pushed it either. I only use the stats given by WordPress; I don't know how accurate those are.\nIf I look at my kids (19 and 15) however, they do not read blogs at all. Unless you count Tumblr. What they do follow are YouTube channels. This is purely anecdotal of course but maybe it's an indication. When I asked my son if any of his friends followed blogs, he said no. They too follow YouTube channels or Facebook pages."
