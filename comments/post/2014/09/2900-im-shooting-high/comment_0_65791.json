    "content": "I'm pretty much in the same boat as Cedric as far as blogging goes, although I am constantly seeking new photos blogs for inspiration.  I admit I don't understand how the blog-o-sphere works these days.  I have over 250 followers yet I'm lucky to get 20-20 visitors per post.  I look at at least 30 different blogs each day and I find myself wondering why sometimes.  Many photoblogs have turned into personal journals not at all related to photography at all.  It's not the reason I subscribed.  So I look and analyze the photographs, scan for keywords in the content and then decide if I want to read the rest.  There are only so many hours in a day and life takes up a lot of them."
