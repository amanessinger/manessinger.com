    "content": "Did I read correctly .... \"send in my camera\"? It's probably a throw back to my professional days, but the idea of having just one camera is beyond my comprehension. I always buy cameras in 2s (at a minimum). Life without a backup or 2 seems unimaginable to me. That's why I have 3 E-P2s sitting around together with my 2 new E-P5s.\n\nThe other advantage of 2 cameras is that I carry them both (ain't small lightweight cameras grand?), one with my 20mm lens (used for 90% of my picture making), the other with my 45mm lens. Haven't had to change a lens in weeks, maybe months."
