Much of my time I don't use a car and two cameras in a bag are twice the weight, regardless of actual numbers. Doesn't work for me.\n\nWhen it comes to backups, well, I can always use the Panasonic LX5 (kept in Vienna) or the Nikon D300 (kept in Villach). I still have a Sigma 28/1.8, a 20/1.8 and a Lensbaby for my Nikon, and that's perfectly fine for bridging a gap. Should I really need a MFT camera, I can always get a cheap one from a shop in Villach, and there'd also be a few shops in Vienna selling used Olympus and Panasonic bodies. But really, I don't see the need. Switching to the small compact or my old big DSLR would even be inspiring ðŸ™‚\n\nThanks for visiting!"
