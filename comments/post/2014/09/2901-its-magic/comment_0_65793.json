    "content": "Well, it seems that if there is a choice between reading a blog or watching a video, blog always loses, at least with the younger generation.\n\nMaybe showing vs. writing is a factor in this. If a thing can be shown in a video, why write about it? In addition, I have a feeling that perhaps the younger brains are being wired differently nowadays. \n\nHowever, it may be that this same thing is happening with the older people as well, only slower. We are turning into video-devouring creatures. \n\nThere is some related discussion going on regarding teaching in schools here in Finland. Namely, the use of games, videos, acting etc. as an alternative to reading a book as a method of teaching. It is said that you learn better when you are engaged in an immersive experience - I guess reading and writing is not such a thing.\n\nFor some reason, I'm sceptic, but that may be due to my age group.\n\nAnyway, I guess there are quite different views of the world depending on media consumption patterns. As an example, I don't watch tv, and this sometimes poses problems because I don't know the \"celebrities\" that pop up in smalltalk these days."
