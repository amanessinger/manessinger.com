    "content": "Well, I understand your points. But the missing Adobe products and the linear movements between desktops aside, I can even live with Gnome3 nowadays. At work (with Red Hat) it's still Gnome2, and who knows what the next stable Debian at home will bring (I think at the moment that would be XFCE or LXDE out of the box); I still prefer it to Windows. And yes, I also run a virtualized Win7, which is ok within Oracle's (formerly Sun's) VirtualBox. Still better than the Vista on my wife's notebook, which is far too much for its older hardware (Celeron and 2GB of RAM).\n\nI've tried Core's \"AfterShot Pro\" which was formerly Bibble Labs Pro, and it's not bad. If I need layers I still give it a try from time to time, but the free RawTherapee is far better IMHO. Other raw converters like Darktable are too much for my machine (which is a quad core with (GB of RAM), even with the relatively small raws from Olympus.\n\nBut even here at IBM, only a handful of colleagues use our Red Hat based \"Open Client\" as a desktop - the majority knows only Windows.\n\nAnd a Mac? Well yes, nice - but I don't wanna move from one walled garden into the next...\n\nOn our (virtual) server I now have the same stable Debian which I use at home - until a few weeks ago, it was still \"Lenny\" (Debian 5), which wasn't supported anymore since a while. So in regard to heartbleed and SSH concerns, I decided that we *had to* upgrade that one."
