    "content": "Nice image, and same here. I can't use Adobe products because they're not available for Linux, and even if they were I doubt that I would. Instead, I use the Olympus Viewer 3 on a small virtualized Win7 image just to keep Olympus' 'magic' colours, and do the rest with RawTherapee on Linux. Tho I have made camera profiles, it's still faster and better than to use RawTherapee alone (which I sometimes do if I want more 'correct' than 'beautiful' colours, and more DR)."
