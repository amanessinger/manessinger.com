    "content": "An incredible church... very beautiful. Interesting fact about the cloth. It occurs to me that some churches drape the altar cross during some intervals of the year... not obscuring it, only like a stoll. I wonder if this is a similar practice but more \"modern\". \n\nVery nice images. You must have had to do some major work on the second image but your corner mask does not take away from the image."
