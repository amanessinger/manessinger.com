Though I'm sure it's bitter-sweet when your best images go unnoticed and it's the quick snap that gets all the glory ðŸ™‚\n\nStill, I liked this image as soon as I saw it. I like how the can reflects the tablecloth pattern. I don't think I've ever had any image make explore but usually that requires placing images in groups and tagging them profusely; activities I have no time for these days. Like you, I have plenty of other activities that I would rather do.\n\nAnyway, I will bask in your glory and start dropping your name at parties ðŸ˜‰"
