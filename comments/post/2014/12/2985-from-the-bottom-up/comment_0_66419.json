    "content": "There are many social changes taking place in America at the moment but sadly change doesn't always mean for the better. 9-11 and the global recession have made much of the poorer, older, whiter, less educated American population ripe for campaigns of fear. These fears are catered to and built upon by certain ultra-conservative media channels which serve up 24/7 propaganda and lies specifically to fan the flames of fear and generate an active power base for approved political candidates. Monies for these political and legislative power grabs are being funneled into these efforts by selective members of the 1% club hoping for control and an even bigger piece of the pie.\n\nIt's sad but true that many Americans have gotten lazy and it's far easier for them to believe what they are being told by some \"news\" medias without taking the time to do the work of investigating from other sources. \n\nI'm ashamed we have let ourselves slip into a social state where any agency or elected official would even think of spying on there citizens and justifying torture in any case. But I am also frustrated as to what to do about it. I vote responsibly and try to speak up against it when there is opportunity but it seems to do little good."
