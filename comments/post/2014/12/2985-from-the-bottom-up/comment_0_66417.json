    "content": "Mike's got it right - the so-called \"American dream\" has become exactly that.  Just a dream.  Even though the economy's improving, most people remain at the bottom of the pile.  With each Supreme Court decision the very wealthy become ever more powerful.  Many elections are a joke.  And as he points out, far too many Americans literally vote against their own best interests (if they bother to vote at all).  It's sad to watch.  \n\nBut it's the torture debate here that is so infuriating.  Listening to Dick Cheney say he'd do it all again \"in a minute\" makes me want to scream.  The guy should be prosecuted and jailed.  There should be no \"debate\" about this nonsense.  Torture is wrong, legally and morally."
