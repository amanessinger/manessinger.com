    "content": "Well, not everything coming from the U.S. is bad, even though the system seems to be totally corrupted. \n\nI'm currently reading Naomi Klein's book \"This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate\", which is in fact a history of the capitalistic movement that is now destroying civilization. In fact, capitalism has become a religion which disregards all evidence that doesn't fit the worldview. It is a disturbing book, but gets things right."
