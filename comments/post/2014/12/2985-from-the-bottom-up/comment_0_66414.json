    "content": "What you see going on in the U.S. right now (guns, torture, human rights, income disparity) is shared by many people here, myself included. Unfortunately, our elections are bought by billionaires and capitalists leaving the majority of Americans totally disenfranchised at the polls. Beyond that, many Americans are voting against their own interests, thinking that they see themselves one day joining the high income 1%. And sad to say, many more are just plain stupid. I am embarrassed by the current state of affairs here and hope it will soon change. I for one am glad you took the opportunity to speak up."
