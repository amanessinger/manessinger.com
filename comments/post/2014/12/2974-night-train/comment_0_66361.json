    "content": "I've gone through a similar experience. I used to be extremely active on Flickr. I even administered some groups. Over the years I managed to befriend a group of people who made it worth while. But eventually some people left or became less active and that kind of created a chain reaction. I too tried 500px but didn't stay long. It seemed like far too much work to make a mark there. Same thing with RedBubble. These days, like John above, I use Flickr as storage but even with that I find my usage somewhat erratic. In fact these days I use the internet quite differently to what I used to. I only get on when I have something specific to do: search for something, shop, or catch up with the handful of blogs I follow. It's amazing how much time was freed up by no longer randomly \"surfing\" the net ðŸ™‚"
