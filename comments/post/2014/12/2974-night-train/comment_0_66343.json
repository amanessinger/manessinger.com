I get the feeling that some people watch the Flickr \"What's New\" feed and randomly pick images that are interesting, but their real motivation is to lure you to THEIR pictures so they can get noticed. \n\nMaybe I am wrong. \n\nIt is OK though... having he backups is nice.\n\nI still have a few images on 500px too but not much action there either."
