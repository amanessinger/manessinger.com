But, \"socialist\" has a much better image here than at the heart of the empire, where it's used synonymously with communist, both meaning \"from the devil\" ðŸ™‚\n\nNevertheless, the idea that a government of the people can and should do something for the people, gets discredited more and more. Propaganda works, and the best propaganda is still bought with money."
