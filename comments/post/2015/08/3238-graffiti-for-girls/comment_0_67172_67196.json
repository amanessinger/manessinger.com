    "content": "Cedric, yes, I admit that the choice of pink is a cultural and a temporary phenomenon, but what matters is the strict division along gender lines. That and the role models are what I consider unhealthy. It's not that I consider men and women equal in all aspects, there are certainly differences, but I don't think that girls are only capable of playing with pink ponies, while boys are creative technicians, politicians and scientists. The cultural division goes deeper and it reaches into education again, preparing children for their role in a conservative society. It's that what worries me. I've seen it change rapidly and I don't like it."
