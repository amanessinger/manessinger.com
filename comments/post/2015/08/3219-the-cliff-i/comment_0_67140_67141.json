I'm 51 now and I think I have made two really good tools in my professional life. One was in the area of distributed systems, one was a web framework in Perl. For both I had tentative permission to release it as open source, both would have needed some cleanup and I never made the final step.\n\nI think I have at least one good idea left. It's a big thing, I am not even sure if it's possible at all, much less if I am able to do it myself, and I am in stasis right now. In fact I've been for two years. If I ever try to pull that off, I may have to cut back photography and blogging even further. For now it does not look all too likely."
