Admittedly I did discover some new music because of your posts but like I said, the music was only secondary to the photos and words. And if some day you decide \"daily\" is too hard I won't be upset. I will only be upset when you stop altogether.\n\nFor now I enjoy your perspective on things as well as the photos from your part of the world so for that alone you have my gratitude."
