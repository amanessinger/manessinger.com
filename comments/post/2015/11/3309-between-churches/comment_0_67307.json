They get used quite a lot, in all manner of online publications , including one or two on Wikipedia.\nI'm not such as photographer as you are, I really just take snapshots of things that interest me and that I can use as illustration to my occasional blog pieces.\nAll of those that get used by others are from Flickr - that's the way people find them. Possibly other photo library sites would do just as well but I mainly use Flickr.\nAnd the ones that get used most are those that illustrate things that there aren't too many free unposed images of. The most-used search term? Office Workers."
