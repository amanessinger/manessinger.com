    "content": "Saramago is one of my all-time favourite authors, but some of his books are such that I haven't been able to finish them. The best ones for me were The Elephant's Journey, The Cave, All the Names, and Death with Interruptions - all of these in excellent Finnish translations. I did like Blindness, but it didn't really convince me, and Seeing was a disappointment. And I didn't manage to read beyond a couple of dozen pages The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis."
