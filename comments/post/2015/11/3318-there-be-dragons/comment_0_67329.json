    "content": "The Circle is a novel by Dave Eggers, and even though it fails as a novel, it contains interesting speculation about transparency and what it would do to people, both ordinary citizens, and those at the top of the political system. It would be like putting predators and preys in a tiny container, without any possibility for hiding."
