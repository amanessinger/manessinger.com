    "content": "Somehow this feels differently from much of your work Andreas. And since art is essentially about communicating feelings, that's significant. And yet I cannot get my words around the difference. There's a quirky almost anthropomorphic character bobbling up there at the end of its tether. He... Uh-huh, it feels like a \"he\" ... He's pulled a smile out of me. It's as if you had that inner child grab then pp this guy. I reeeely enjoy this Andreas.\n\nHope all is well and that your swimming trunks are out of moth balls."
