    "content": "I've pretty much given up comparing sensor sizes - m43 is all I am willing to carry, and whilst it doesn't give me extreme unsharpness in the out-of-focus areas, it most often delivers images pleasing to the eye without crying \"wow - see what an effect I am able to achieve\". So I can concentrate on image properties more important to me and my way of seeing and perceiving. I've yet to meet a paying customer who refuses my images because of the sensor size in use ðŸ˜‰"
