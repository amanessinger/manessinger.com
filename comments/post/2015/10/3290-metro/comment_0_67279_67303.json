    "content": "In many cases it is also a matter of physical circumstances and of the preservation of a place's characteristics. Take the historical cobblestone pavement in cities like Bergamo. It's a nightmare for wheelchair users, it renders large parts of the center inaccessible to them, but at the same time it's part of the cultural heritage. But then, Bergamo's center is full of steep streets anyway. The pavement is only one of the problems. The same is true for Lisbon and its districts on the hills. Of course it's a matter of money as well."
