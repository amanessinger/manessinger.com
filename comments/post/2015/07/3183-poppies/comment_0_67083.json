I especially like your self discipline here in sitting on the saturation heat. It's virtually a high-key approach that turns the setting into both a foreground AND background framing of a feeling. Yep you've done this before but here you've cranked back on allowing the image to tell its own story, and instead have reeeeeely shown how less can be a LOT more."
