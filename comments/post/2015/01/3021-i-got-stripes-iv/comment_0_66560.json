    "content": "My Gmail account got to the point where I would get almost a hundred SPAM messages a day and among those would be legitimate messages but sifting through all that SPAM every day became to much of a chore so I gave up on it. For the last two years I've used Outlook.com and my SPAM box barely gets one a week and about twice a year it will be a legitimate message. What I'm finding though is that I am using email less and less, mostly just for blog responses and a couple of subscriptions. Oh, and bills of course). Only two or three of my friends use email anymore (mostly just SMS and FB Messenger)."
