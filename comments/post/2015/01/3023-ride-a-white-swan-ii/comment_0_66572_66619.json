Probably because it's rare to point a long lens with the perfect focal length and a wide aperture at exactly the right moment ... and even nail focus ðŸ™‚\n\nTechnically the same image with a longer lens is harder to get, which makes it more desireable. Take an image from space. Lots of such swans on it, right? ðŸ™‚"
