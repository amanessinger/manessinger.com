    "content": "Well, the 75/1.8 is wickedly sharp, well controlled regarding aberrations and it focuses extremely fast. That's something of a bonus over my cheap, cheap Olympus 40-150/4.0-5.6. The other bonus is of course the ability to use very shallow DOF. Note though that I don't do that most of the time. Shallow DOF is an effect that can be interesting, but it does not \"make\" an image all by itself. Composition frequently does, and you can perfectly compose with your Panasonic. Thus you should be fine as long as you don't crave for shallow DOF.\n\nAnd if you do, a Nikon 180/2.8 AI-S and an adapter can be had for an extremely low price. It won't auto-focus, but it's long and as shallow as you may want."
