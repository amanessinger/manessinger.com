    "content": "I have been thinking about CC which I have for a long time been resistant to thinking Adobe was being a bully about the shift to subscription. The cost is reasonable and it would be nice to always be up to date but frankly my older Photoshop CS4 and Lightroom 5 do pretty much what I need. But now upgrading to LR 6 is about the same cost as the move to CC and I get the latest Photoshop as a bonus. My only worry is some day I will not have the money or need for the latest versions but then no easy access to my processed photos when the CC gets turned off. \n\nGood to hear it went smoothly for you... that is good indeed."
