You would laikely have tagged your processed images, if not you could find out using Lightroom CC as long as you have it. You could export the processed files as TIFF, and you could even save Photoshop files in an older format, probaly losing some adjustments while still keeping the basic recipe. No, I think it's mostly a mental problem of owning or not. \n\nHint: with most software you don't own anyway, you pay for a right to use. It's not so much of a difference."
