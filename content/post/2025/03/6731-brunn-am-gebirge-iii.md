Same place, a rare "landscape" oriented church interior. 

I like my dynamic screensavers/backgrounds on the Mac, but
before them, I have always used my own photos as background
images. And it wasn't so easy. Printed, it doesn't matter,
but I don't print. On a monitor, especially when the image
is a desktop background, you need it in landscape
orientation. When you have a wide screen (I use everything
between the Macbook Pro's built-in screen, up to at home an
LG with 5120x2160), you really want to cover it, without big
black borders and without cutting from the image.

Turns out, I see vertically. "Portrait" mode, as they call
it. It's about two thirds of my images. Of the rest, maybe
half are square or squarish :grin:
