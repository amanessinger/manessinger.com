I didn't buy the Olympus PEN F for its front dial. I bought
it, because it is a beautiful camera, matching my silver
lenses. The knob at the front is useless for me. You can use
it to switch between various "picture modes". You can use it
to adjust colors and contrast, but it is all for JPEG only.
Using it is distracting while shooting, and in the end, all
the hassle was for a JPEG. You can't even program it for
other functions. If at all, I use it for quickly switching
to black and white for preview.

You can imagine, I was not thrilled to find the same useless
gadget on the new OM-3. Take it away, give me a better
viewfinder instead :grin:
