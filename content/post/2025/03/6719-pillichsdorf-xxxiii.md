Some people like the OM-3's looks. I don't. The knob on the
front is distracting on the big, flat front. There's too
much black mixed into the silver on its knobs and dials.
Worst of all, the camera has no proper grip. I don't like to
hold such cameras.

Of course, the PEN F has no grip either, but you can get
several grips, the one I have is even from Olympus. 

At first, there were none for the OM-3, but [how about
this](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/135584234944?_trksid=p2332490.c101224.m-1)
or
[that](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405587604472?_trksid=p2332490.c101224.m-1)?
These are Ebay listings, they might vanish any time, but
just google yourself for "om 3 grip".

That's a world of a difference! You can have the plate in
silver and black, and the wooden grip in brown or almost
black. Beautiful, and if I didn't have a fully functional
PEN F (with about the same viewfinder size), and if I had
not just bought an OM-1 Mk ii, I could imagine going for
this beauty.
