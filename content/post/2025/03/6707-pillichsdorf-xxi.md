These images were still made with the then pretty new
[Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark
III](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympus-om-d-e-m1-mark-iii-review).
I still use it with the light
[12-45/4.0](https://explore.omsystem.com/us/en/m-zuiko-ed-12-45mm-f4-0-pro).
I only use it on my way from home to work and back, but
that's at least twice a week.

In the meantime, I've bought the [OM System
OM-1](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-1-review)
when it came out, and a week ago the already one year old
[OM System OM-1 Mark
II](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-1-mark-ii-initial-review).
At current pace, you'll see images taken with it not before
2030 :grin:

Why two almost identical cameras? Didn't I [think about
changing
systems](https://blog.andreas-manessinger.info/2024/07/6481-sarnthein-vii)?

I made up my mind when OM System came out with the gorgeous
[OM System
OM-3](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-3-review).
It's the official successor to the even more gorgeous
[Olympus
PEN-F](https://www.lukeptaylor.com/blog/olympus-pen-f-one-and-done-legend-a-review-in-2024),
and it inherits practically everything the OM System OM-1
Mark II has, with one exception: the viewfinder. On the OM-3 it is
OLED, but only has the same resolution of 2.36M dots as the nine
years old PEN-F. I can live with that, and a new Canon EOS
R7 comes with the same spec, but being used to the OM System
OM-1's 5.76m dot OLED viewfinder with 0.83x magnification, I
was very reluctant to shell out 2000â‚¬ for a camera that
might fill me with regret when looking through.

Well, the OM System OM-1 Mark II is only a small, but in
some respects significant upgrade to the Mark I. More
buffer, more speed, a computational variant of a graduated
ND filter (based on multiple shots). Look for "om system
live graduated nd filter review" on your favorite search
engine. [This
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHkyqu1Fb3I) is, for
instance, a good example.

And of course half a stop of additional stabilization. Can't
have enough of that :grin:
