That's one of those images, that can't be taken as an
in-camera JPEG. Too much contrast, and though the camera's
algorithms and your personal taste may frequently align,
they rarely do in this situation.

Sure, you can choose a different "picture style", or
whatever your brand calls it, but why? I really prefer the
convenience of concentrating on seeing and framing, without
constantly fiddling with camera settings. Details like
contrast distribution, color or black and white, color
temperature, are for post-processing.
