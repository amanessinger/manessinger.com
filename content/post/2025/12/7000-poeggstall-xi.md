7000 posts since mid-October 2006. My decision to
practically cut off communication by not implementing a
proper commenting system (what is currently in place is
quite broken, and I have no time to fix it) has probably
cost me most of my reach. 

Not only are there no "interactive" comments, there are also
no stats counting, no tracking, no analytics. The reason was
legislation in the EU, which requires user consent for
cookies, storing email addresses and so on. As much as I
love the EU for almost everything else, including the GDPR,
cookie consent banners were a complication I did not want to
deal with. This was especially since it didn't easily fit
the intended serverless architecture of this blog.

I might correct this in the future, but as of now, I cannot
say how many people I still reach. Well, maybe after
retirement. This will be in early 2029, or effectively late
2028, if I keep hoarding vacation days :grin:

Anyway, here's another detail from the chapel of Pöggstall.
