Again, the Sigma 56mm f/1.4. was my long lens of duty.
Conversion and noise reductions were done with DxO and their
DeepPRIME software. The reason, of course, is the brutal
contrast.

In order to not blow the highlights and lose the glorious
window colors, I had to expose for the highlights.
Naturally, that left the center of the altar in deep
shadows.

I could have used bracketed exposures and merged them in
Lightroom, but as you can see, the shadows in the altar
picture are clean, even from a single exposure taken with a
9-year-old camera.
