Looking even further down :grin:

No, light was not like that. I've pushed colors, and in this
image maybe a little bit far. It does not matter. On a clear
day with blue sky and artificial lighting in the staircase,
this would be closer to the real thing. Even then, it would
probably take blue and yellow artificial lights to get the
difference that extreme. So, we can pretend that such
lighting had been present. You likely wouldn't be able to
tell, and I may not be able to remember by now.

Reality is a strange thing. I strongly believe in it, in the
sense that there is only one reality. Everything else leads
to chaos. Just look at what Trump does. Like for any modern
dictator, the destruction of the concept of reality is his
goal.

Of course, there is also the fact that not everyone can
equally partake in all aspects of reality. For instance, not
having been there gives you a severe disadvantage compared
to eyewitnesses.

And then, even eyewitnesses frequently disagree. What
remains? For instance, what was recorded, or of the records,
what was finally published.

And here you have it. For most of you, this image is
reality.
