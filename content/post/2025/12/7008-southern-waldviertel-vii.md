One more, all in the same place. 

Well, you can't stop the car every 100 meters. There might
be reasons to do so, but you just don't. Sometimes you stop,
and then it's the first opportunity after the view that made
you want to stop in the first place. You can't help it, and
so you try to get the best out of what you find.

The alternative? Walking, of course, but then, by walking, I
couldn't have seen all that I've seen on that afternoon.
Everything is a compromise, memories are what remains, and
what remains is often accidental. Hope you like these
accidents :grin:
