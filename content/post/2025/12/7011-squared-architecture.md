So this was it. 2025. The year Trump made America Great
Again! And what a greatness it is.

The optimist in me says that even this will go away. The
problem is the tremendous damage done. Look at this year
alone: every day something stupid, and even in the best of
cases, he has one more year to top it. More likely we speak
of three more years of random devastation, and we can only
hope for a resemblance of free elections in the future.

What Trump has done is breaking the consensus about what can
be done and what not. Yes, we have laws, but they don't
regulate everything. That's ok, because there is a consensus
about things that honest people won't do. Don't get me
wrong, every country has a problem with corruption. Some
more, some less, but the tendency to corrupt is part of
human nature. It's the ego's way to strive for dominance,
but in a healthy society, social conscience and individual
shame balance the forces of the ego.

Now, the most shamelessly corrupt person is the President of
the United States. Not only his voters, the whole world will
pay the price for it.
