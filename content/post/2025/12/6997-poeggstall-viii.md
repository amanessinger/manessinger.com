The chapel within the castle was interesting. Not because it
was beautiful, quite to the contrary, but because it was
completely unusual. Think of an almost square hall, divided
by columns along the center axis, filled with "church
things". It looks as if someone had decorated a ballroom
with remains of a church. Nothing quite makes sense.
