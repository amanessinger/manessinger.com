Many taverns in places like Obersiebenbrunn have closed.
This is very near Vienna. 50 years ago, many people in this
region worked in agriculture. Yes, there was mechanization,
but not to the degree of today. People still were needed,
and they worked there, and after work they drank beer in the
local tavern, played card games, watched TV there.

Today, most people work in Vienna. They leave early and
return late, spending money and time in shopping centers on
the way. The old villages lose taverns and shops, and that
enforces the effect. At one time you didn't want to spend
your time in the tavern, now you can't.
