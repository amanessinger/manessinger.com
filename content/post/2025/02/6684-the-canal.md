Same place, looking from the restaurant down to the
[Danube-Oder
Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube%E2%80%93Oder_Canal),
or at least what's left of it. It was an old idea from early
renaissance: being able to go by ship across Europe. Through
Bavaria, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania,
river Danube connects middle Europe with the Black Sea, and
then through the Bosporus with the Mediterranean.

River Oder has its source in Czechia, and from there runs
north. As Poland moved west as a result of WWII, river Oder
became a large part of the border between (then
East-)Germany and Poland. The canal would have opened a
connection between the Mediterranean and Northern Germany,
Scandinavia and England.

Needless to say that it was too grand an idea to be
realized. On the other hand, no idea could have been too
grand for the Nazis to not try it. Try they did and ... of
the planned 320 kilometers, they managed to dig around four.
Still, a beautiful result.
