That's the bright window on the right side of the altar,
exposed and processed to not burn out any of the colors. Did
I ever mention we need broad availability of HDR-capable
screens. Like, 95% of devices have it? 

It already looks pretty good on my Macbook Pro when I turn
on maximum brightness. Even real HDR would be possible on the
Mac, but for everyone else it would look dull. So, let's
wait another decade :grin:
