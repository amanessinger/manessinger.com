What you see here is, what Pillichsdorf is famous for. It's called "Kellergasse". 

Pillichsdorf is on the southern side of the "Wagram", a
small range of hills in the flatlands north of river Danube.
Basically that's material the glaciers and the river have
carved out. It is excellent terroir for fine white wines.
The southern faces of the soft hills are therefore covered
in vineyards. From the villages, small roads with wine
cellars on both sides lead up the hill. That's what's called
a "Kellergasse".

Pillichsdorf has two one-ways, one leading up, one down.
