Our part of Vienna is dead flat and runs out into farmed
land. Flat means wind, and therefore we are able to reap a
lot of windpower. Are they beautiful? Nope. Are they ugly?
Nope. Are they better than smoking chimneys? Yup.

Still, there are people who have the freakish desire to
oppose them. Because they oppose everything that's useful
and doesn't hurt anybody. They are against anything that
solves problems, because problems are what they need to
blame everyone else. Solutions would hurt only them.
