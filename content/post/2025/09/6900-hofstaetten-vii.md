This image pretty much reflects what I saw. The
out-of-camera image didn't. I strongly had to boost
saturation of the flower's colors. Contrast may play a role.
Photography is probably quite exact, but the interaction of
the physical eye and what the brain makes of nerve signals
is messy :grin:

In the end, it's understandable. One time the eye sees
something in nature and under natural light of a certain
quality and strength. The other time it sees a picture
recorded by a sensor and then displayed on a screen of some
quality, emitting light approximating the digital values of
the sensor. Really, why should we even expect the impression
to be the same?
