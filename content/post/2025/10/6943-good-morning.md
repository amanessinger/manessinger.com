Why is this image black and white? I couldn't remember, and
when I compared it to the original in Lightroom, it became
immediately clear. The bright yellow-green of trees and
grass so completely dominates the image, that it looks
asymmetric. The real subject, the pattern of the fence and
its shadow, the view along the sidewalk, almost vanishes.
