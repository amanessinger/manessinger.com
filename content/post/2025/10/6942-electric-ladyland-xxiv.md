You have seen that tree, you might see it again. It always
catches my attention, and on my way to work, I pass it
regularly. What fascinates me is the window cut into the
crown, in order to keep tree and electric pole apart. It's
kind of a blend between a natural and an artificial world,
both seeming oblivious of each other. Or so I imagine :grin:
