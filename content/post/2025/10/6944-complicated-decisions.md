Curves, oblique lines, some verticals giving depth. What you
see is the third attempt at processing it. Basically, the
problem is the big, dark shadow area in the foreground.
Selectively lightening it up and decreasing contrast in that
area did the trick. Easy in black and white, but in color,
you have to fight color and saturation shifts. It's messy,
but now I think it's ok.
