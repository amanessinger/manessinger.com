Lower Austria is divided into four so-called quarters,
Industry Quarter in the south-east, Fruit Quarter in the
south-west, Wood Quarter in the north-west, and finally Wine
Quarter in the north-east. Vienna sits squat at the center.

We are in Wine Quarter now, and at the right time of the
year you can drink it in front of small cellars built into
the gentle slopes. Just like here.
