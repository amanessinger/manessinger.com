This area is called Lobau. It's a left-over from before the
regulation of river Danube. It's also an important national
park, that has been endangered multiple times by power
station and highway construction projects.

At the moment, the project in discussion is a tunnel below
the river and the park. From my point of view, the main
objection against it is that it will create even more
traffic. On the other hand, if you regularly need to use the
always congested current tangential highway, then even the
distribution of traffic sounds like a good idea.

This leaves air pollution from the tunnel's vents, but
progressing electrification of traffic will help a lot.

You see, as a Green voter and as being directly affected by
current congestion, I'm divided on this project but
tendentially supportive.
