Donauinsel is an artificial, long-stretching island, that
divides river Danube all along its way through Vienna. One
half, _New Danube_ is always kept lower than the other, and
in times of high water, it works as perfect protection for
the city.

The image has been taken from the island, across _New
Danube_.
