Slightly atypical for December in Austria. At least it used
to be atypical. Last winter we had two cases of snowfall in
Vienna. Both were about one millimeter, and one of them was
_industry snow_, i.e. vapor from industrial processes,
frozen in cold air. It covered just our district in Vienna.
Both times it was gone in a day :grin:
