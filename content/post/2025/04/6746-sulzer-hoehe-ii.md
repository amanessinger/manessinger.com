It's rare, that I use the ultra-wide for an outdoor
landscape image. One typical use is, when I see some
foreground interest, strong lines leading into the image, or
something like that. Of course, the ultra-wide is ...
ultra-wide, and you normally have to manage whatever it
catches left and right, in order to keep the image from
being unintendedly busy. 

Here, it was easy: just a grassy hill and a solitary tree.
Plenty of opportunity to play with sun, shadows and clouds.
