Kaltenleutgeben is a village along a road through a narrow
valley in the gentle hills called Wienerwald. We drove
through, but I thought, what the heck, why not just stop for
the church. The image is in black and white, because as much
as I tried it in color, I could not get anthing pleasing out
of the bad light.
