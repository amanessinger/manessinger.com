Another black and white image, same reason, again processed
towards an infrared look, but this time more high-key. It got
perfectly rid of the purple fringing in the trees, caused by
overexposure along strong contrast lines near the corners. 

A split ND filter would have been handy. Meanwhile, in the
OM-1 ii, I have it built into the camera as digital
simulation, based on multiple exposures.
