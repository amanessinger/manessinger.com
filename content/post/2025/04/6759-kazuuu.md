When Irene and I parted, Kazuuu! and Gamer stayed with her.
There was no question about it. I still miss them.

By the way, the lens is the [Mitakon Speedmaster 42.5mm
f/1.2](https://zyoptics.net/product/mitakon-42-5mm-f1-2/),
probably one of my least used lenses. This cat portrait was
the first image taken with it :grin:
