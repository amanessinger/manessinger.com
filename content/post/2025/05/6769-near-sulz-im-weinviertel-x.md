This may be the 42.5 or not. Those manual lenses don't
communicate with the camera, but Olympus cameras have a list
of lenses that you can edit. If you select one of those
lenses, that's what gets written into EXIF data. You can
also program a button to bring up that list. As long as you
don't forget to set the correct entry in the list when
switching lenses, you're fine.
