More of Alice Weidel's "Wheels of Shame" :grin:

By the way: her party, the AfD, has now been confirmed as a
right-wing extremist force by the German Federal Office for
the Protection of the Constitution. Not some party members.
The whole party.

That's the party J. D. Vance and Elon Musk root for. And, of
course, AfD and their likes all over Europe sympathize
strongly with Trump and Putin. Once that would have been a
contradiction, today they are one lot.
