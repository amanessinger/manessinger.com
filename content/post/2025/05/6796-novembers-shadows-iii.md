How do you handle your Trump Derangement Syndrom? Turns out,
I do the same thing people have always done under the
onslaught of fascism. I'm looking away.

Actually, I have changed my reading habits. I used to
consume all kinds of news from at least a few outlets of
high reputation. I used to read long articles in the New
York Times, The Guardian and other international newspapers,
I've read DerStandard in Austria, a lot of technical news,
photo news, and so on and so forth. I still do, but a lot
less. It's so annoying, that a stupid, vain, lawless old man
not only gets away with what he does, no, his position gets
more and more solid.

The great Jewish Author Stefan Zweig escaped from Austria
and ended up committing suicide in his Brazilian Exile in
February 1942. Imagine that: This was before Stalingrad,
this was at the height of Hitler's success. What a hopeless
death!
