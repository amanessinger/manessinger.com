Still, I worry about democracy. The problem is this:

We try to make it very hard to convict someone for his
crimes. It's for a reason. Very often you don't know for
sure, and in doubt, you let someone very likely guilty get
away. You can't prove beyond reasonable doubt. And still,
from to time someone innocent ends up in jail. No judgement
is perfect, but we try. That's also the reason why civilized
countries have given up on the death penalty. You can free
someone from jail, but you cannot revive him.

This is a system know to work, but only under some
conditions. The most important is, you must never let
sociopaths and shameless criminals come to power. Once they
do, they won't play by the rules of civilization.

You see this with Trump. Every day he invents some bizarre,
monstrous falseness. Pulls it out of thin air. And then he
acts on that, accuses a random victim, makes them suffer,
all while committing his next crime.
