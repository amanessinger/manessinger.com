I have no idea what the solution is. It's not that the
Americans haven't tried. Oh yes, they have. Their system of
checks and balances is one of the most intricate in the
world, it just was not enough. 

We saw a similar thing with the rise of Victor Orbán in
Hungary. The social-democratic party was affected by a
scandal, the left in general was deeply divided, and then
the unimaginable happened: Orbán won elections with a
two-thirds majority.

Two thirds, that is a deliberately high limit for changing
the constitution. For a long time, it was deemed the gold
standard for protecting democracies from gliding into
tyranny. Unless the dam broke in Hungary.
