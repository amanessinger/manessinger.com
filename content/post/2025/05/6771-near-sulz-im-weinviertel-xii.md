The right-wing fringe has discovered wind energy as the
enemy. Their fossil-fuel masters want us to burn "beautiful
clean coal" and oil.

It's incredible, but there is a gullible part of the
population that does not have to be convinced of anything,
it suffices to fuel their anger. In a speech at the AfD
party convent, Alice Weidel recently fumed about "Wheels of
shame," and how they would tear them down when coming to
power. Can you imagine that? Wheels of shame?? How stupid is
that?
