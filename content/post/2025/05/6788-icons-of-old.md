Iconography of traffic signs is extremely conservative. You
don't want it to change too often. There are drivers out
there who learned traffic signs sixty years ago. Better not
confuse them. And if I think of it: it's about 42 years
since driving school, and 55 years since I learned traffic
signs in school. Oh well, better don't confuse me :grin:
