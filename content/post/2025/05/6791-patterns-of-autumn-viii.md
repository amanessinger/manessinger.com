Still images of 2020. Last week we returned from a four-day
trip to [Český
Krumlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cesk%C3%BD_Krumlov),
one of Europe's most beautiful towns, conveniently reachable
from Vienna in just two hours by car. I returned with about
1000 RAW files. Sure, there are a few multi-shots for
panorama or HDR, but I expect something around 200 final
images worth processing. It will take them a long time to
appear on this blog.

This suggests I should do something about it, for instance,
return to multiple images per day. It won't happen before my
retirement in four years, though. In the meantime, images
will keep piling up.

The reason is that I can't process as fast as I would have
to. At the moment, I have 32 images of 2020 left, and
already about 100 processed of 2021. Of course, I have more,
but those 100 are contiguous in the sense that nothing
worthwhile is in between.
