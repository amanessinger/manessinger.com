I get it, Micro Four Thirds needs wider apertures than "Full
Frame" for the same shallowness of depth of field. On the
other hand, of course, the opposite is also true: this is
only F10, and both foreground and background are in focus.
Turns out I need depths more often than shallowness, and if
I really need it, I can always use an f1.2 or even f0.95 lens.
They are underused, but I have them :grin:
