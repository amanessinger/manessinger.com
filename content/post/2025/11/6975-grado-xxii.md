Like almost everywhere along northern Italy's Adriatic
coast, Grado has a shallow sandy beach with relatively small
tidal differences. It's a paradise for families with little
children. I, on the other hand, strongly prefer the rocky
Croatian coast, but then, from time to time, sand is ok for
me.

Other than that, today [my
father](/2007/02/135-my-father-is-carpenter) would have been
90 years old. Alas, he died on August 16th, 2017 from
cancer. Already so long ago.
