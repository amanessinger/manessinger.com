Sometimes I like going low. When I think about it, my
picturing style is much more conservative now, than it was,
say, 15 years ago. It's a matter of purpose. Today, my
images are much more a device for my own memory. If you only
have pictures with wildly distorted perspectives and
proportions, they may sometimes be better pictures, but less
effective as memories.
