I have not achieved anything today. Well, I got my hair cut. I cut down my backlog in Google Reader, albeit mostly by glancing at the posts, sometimes not even that, but many of them I actually read, and that way I learned a lot. For instance that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/">Paul Lester</a> got crazy and bought an M9. That's a Leica and you can buy a decent car for that. Congratulations ðŸ™‚

 Other than that, I read "Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions", a book that I bought twice, the first time more than two months ago in form of a brick, fit to be used as a weapon (and win you any fight), which was fine, but stayed more or less unread, because it was impossible to carry it around.

 Two days ago I've finally bought it like I should have bought it right in the beginning: as an eBook on my new Amazon Kindle.

Surprised? So was I. Remember: I passionately hate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm">DRM</a>, but in this case it was just a matter of reading a particular book or not. I wouldn't do it in the paper edition and I do it on the Kindle. DRM or not, it's useful and I love that device. Money on the hardcopy is not wasted though. I will put it on my book shelf at work, where it will be useful as a reference.


I took the Image of the Day right in front of our apartment's door. It's rainy and cool, defying the fact that tomorrow is the official start of this year's swimming season ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/in_the_still_of_the_night.html">In The Still Of The Night</a>" by Charlie Parker, a very peculiar version with chorus, vocals arranged by Dave Lambert. Yes, that's THE Dave Lambert from Lambert Hendricks & Ross fame. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxtomSATLNM&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
