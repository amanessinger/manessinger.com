It's not only the sight, it is also the smell. Acacia are so incredibly seductive, it's impossible to describe. Wonderful trees, and right now they are in full blossom.

 The Song of the Day, for whatever reason, is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/steve_earle/to_live_is_to_fly.html">To Live Is To Fly</a>", again by Steve Earle, but this time from his 2009 album "Townes", an excellent collection of Townes Van Zandt covers. Wonderful lyrics, by the way. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CfjOZQ0FSE">YouTube</a>.
