"Meets / Hurts"? Whatever. In any case we have a chance meeting of two images.

Excellent food, not exactly expensive, not cheap either, but you get what you pay for. Try the mixed starter plate (the cooked variant) and you'll be excited.

 The Image of the Day is just something that caught my eye. I don't even know what it was, but then I concentrated on the lock and the strange message, and in the end I liked the framing.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/roxy_music/chance_meeting.html">Chance Meeting</a>" from the 1972 Roxy Music debut album. We had the album a few times, but this is really a classic and every single song would be a reason to buy the whole album.
