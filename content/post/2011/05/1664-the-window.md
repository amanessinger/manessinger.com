Every day is bright now, and I, I am naive as a child. I see and I take in and I feel and I marvel at the light - and I'm glad.

 Vienna is an old city. An industrial building from 1892 is hardly remarkable at all. And still, that's 120 years ago, and that's more than any living person can remember.

The Song of the day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/the_window.html">The Window</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 1979 album "Recent Songs". A long time ago as well. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVeEmsAGHvw&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
