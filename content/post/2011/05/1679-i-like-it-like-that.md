Here's an image that I made in the morning. I am not sure why it came out out of focus, maybe I switched on the camera and released the shutter before the focus was locked, maybe it was due to one of my experiments.

 Anyway. The matter is, I like it like that ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smokey_robinson_the_miracles/i_like_it_like_that.html">I Like It Like That</a>" by Smokey Robinson & The Miracles. I have it on an "Ultimate Collection" that I bought recently. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOwvLOXdLa0">YouTube</a>.
