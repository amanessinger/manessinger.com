Bike photography is just the right genre for me. I had already seen this bicycle 
yesterday, and although I had taken some images, none of them was exactly what I wanted. The best of the bunch had still the sign post on the left slightly cut, so I gave up and in the evening used another image.

 Fortunately when I came by again today, it was still there, weather was still fine, the light was slightly different, but that didn't matter in the shade, thus I could take the image again and now it's OK. Try that with people as a subject ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "See You Once Again" from Dutch singer Wouter Hamel's 2009 second album "Nobodyâ€™s tune". YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNUfQ_cn1XM">video</a>.
