Well, here's the other side of "liquid". This is an image made in the afternoon through the window of my office. I suppose you can understand why I had no problem getting rid of color completely ðŸ™‚

 It looked as if the sky had decided to release this year's rain all in five minutes. And really, though it lasted probably longer than five minutes, when I left for the train half an hour later, the sun was shining and the street was almost dry again.  

The Song of the Day is "Liquid Days (Part II)" from Philip Glass' 1986 album "Songs From Liquid Days". Even more beautiful music. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQqHFmxEnXk&NR=1">YouTube</a>.
