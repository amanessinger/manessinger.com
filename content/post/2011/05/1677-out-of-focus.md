The more you deviate from f2.0, the less beautiful is the bokeh of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5. Here's an image at f5.0. You can clearly see the hexagonal shape of the aperture, but for this image I think it works. It emphasizes the flowers, making them bigger, especially those in the background.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/mick_jagger/out_of_focus.html">Out Of Focus</a>" from Mick Jagger's 1993 album "Wandering Spirit". It's not available for download, but at least I've found a video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSuToqhpobc">YouTube</a>.
