And here's finally a post for today. I saw this bike while I went to work, and, I don't know why, to me it looks ashamed. Poor boy, what have you done?

 "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/po_boy.html">Po' Boy</a>", the Song of the Day, is from Bob Dylan's 2001 album "Love and Theft". There are only cover versions on YouTube (like for all Dylan songs; thanks Sony), so in order to hear the song, you have to be satisfied with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bobdylan.com/sites/www.bobdylan.com/themes/dylan/player.php?song_nid=886&album_nid=6311">30 second sample</a>. It perfectly conveys the essence though.
