So, this is my best image of today??? Heaven, no! It's just the one that I like best ðŸ™‚

 It's the light. This image does not capture anything unusual or interesting, but it happens to catch a kind of light that had the power to make me glad. A short, fleeting moment of intense happiness, and that's not shabby either ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Las Simples Cosas". You may know the version by the great Chavela Vargas, but today it is Martirio on her 1999 album "Flor de piel". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VmUfeqoPHg">YouTube</a> has a video with the song in the background.
