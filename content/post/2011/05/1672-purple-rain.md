It's still Wednesday, early evening by now, but there is still sun outside. Can I have this time of the year for the whole year please?

We are getting closer now. Here's an image of yesterday. An old woman looked wary when she saw me leaning over the flower bed, but I was neither sick nor out for mischief. I just tried to get a nice distribution of these flowers, together with the branch.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/prince/purple_rain.html">Purple Rain</a>". I am quite sure that I have never used it before, but even if I had, it would probably not have been this version.

Randy Crawford on her 1995 album of cover versions "Naked and True". Some people may hate it, I think it's beautiful. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGTuKBHYu30&feature=related">YouTube</a>. By the way, I can't believe it, although I have several Prince albums, I don't have his original of this song. Shame on me ðŸ™‚
