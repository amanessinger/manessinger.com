Well, I need to make this very, very short. I ought to be in bed already. It's gonna be a hard day tomorrow.

Here are two images made Tuesday afternoon, one of a mysterious bloody T in the Underground, and the other of stars fallen on a car. Interesting, I like that view in winter, I like it in Autumn, and I really didn't expect it in Spring, but I like it anyway.

I have it on some "Ultimate Collection" and that's what I link to, because it seemingly is not available as digital download. See a promotion video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrIlv3eVwkE">YouTube</a>.

That's it for today, catching up will have to wait ðŸ˜„
