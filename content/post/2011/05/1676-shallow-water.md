This is a place where I've been before and that you've seen first in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/06/987-its-green-dream-ii.html">987 - It's A Green Dream II</a>" and then, a year later, in the second and third image of "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/06/1330-how-much-can-you-take.html">1330 - How Much Can You Take?</a>".

I don't particularly like the <a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090626_162051_ps.jpg">2009 version</a> (made with the Tokina 11-16 at 11 mm), but the <a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100604_170538_ps.jpg">ultra-wide 2010 version</a> is clearly my favorite. Today's image (well, actually yesterday's, as it's already Sunday afternoon) was made with the LX5 at its widest. Of course 24 mm can't compete with 8 mm for drama, but I still like the result.

 In both images I had to cope with an abundance of contrast, in all three images I had to decide about the color look. Maybe this latest version, although it has a yellowish cast, is the most natural. Under a roof of sunlit leaves you simply have to accept a cast. It's the color of light.

The Song of the Day is "Shallow Water Suite" from Cubanismo's 2000 album "Mardi Gras Mambo". It was not available on YouTube or elsewhere, thus I have uploaded it myself. Unfortunately it is blocked worldwide. WMG, what have I expected? Obviously the album sells so well, that selling a few more would have made the coffers at WMG's corporate headquarters overflow. Or something like that. Oh dear!!!
