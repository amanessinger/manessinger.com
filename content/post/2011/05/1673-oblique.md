I could have used many images of today, and there is at least one other that I absolutely love, but I guess it's enough. I've been sitting here for more than three hours now, working on my blog. The other images went on my TODO list. Fear not, there will be days of need ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is a song that I can't remember having heard a single time. Maybe that's even correct, but if so, then it was a grave mistake. 

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/critique_oblique.html">Critique Oblique</a>" is from the Jethro Tull double album "Nightcap - The Unreleased Masters 1973-1991". Quite good if you ask me. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQQzsw21Lew">YouTube</a>.
