Things have changed. Light has changed. Remember the rusty letters in <a target="_blank" href="/2011/05/1664-the-window.html">yesterday's image</a>? Rusty indeed, but they still did sparkle and shine, and if I think of it, so does the whole city.

 Must be Spring, if you ask me.

The Song of the Day is "Sparkle and Shine" from Steve Earle's 2007 album "Washington Square Serenade". It was recommended by <a target="_blank" href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/">Bill Birtch</a> and I like it a lot. Thanks Bill!

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaR7JZIinNk">YouTube</a>.
