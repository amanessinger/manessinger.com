It's Friday and I am on the train again. Today most of my relatively few images were about shadows on the sidewalk. In the end this one made it.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_weller/friday_street.html">Friday Street</a>" from Paul Weller's 1997 album "Heavy Soul". We already had the song in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/10/1106-friday-street.html">1106 - Friday Street</a>", but for a completely different image. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbRMaMwZ60Q">YouTube</a>.
