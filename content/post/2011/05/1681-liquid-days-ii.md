Reflections have an enormous potential to distort reality, and the less plain the reflecting surface is, the better it gets.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110526_185514_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110526_185514_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Of those two images I like the square best, because it's more abstract, while the other image is slightly more dynamic. You decide.

Regarding abstractness, I could probably even have gone B&W and it would have worked well, but here I like the colors too much.

 Back in 2007, in "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/05/209-liquid-days.html">209 â€“ Liquid Days</a>", we already had this album. The Song of the Day is "Liquid Days (Part I)" from Philip Glass' 1986 album "Songs From Liquid Days". Beautiful music, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6M8AI_Ex8E">hear for yourself</a>.
