Oh dear, it's already Wednesday and I have not posted the image for Monday. Sorry, here it is ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/complicated_shadows.html">Complicated Shadows</a>" from Elvis Costello's 2009 album "Secret, Profane And Sugarcane". 

Funny, it seems I have not used the song before, although I could have sworn I did. Maybe because there was no video available? Well, now it is. YouTube has a great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EnqksUMO3E&feature=related">2010 live version</a> from Spanish television.
