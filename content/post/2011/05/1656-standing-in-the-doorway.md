We had a mix of rain and sun today and we used the afternoon for a short trip through Villach's rural environment. 


Here's an image of a ruin that we found at a crossing in the middle of a forest. It may have been a small administration building for a mining company, but I have no way to tell. I suppose it's not older than 80 years and it must have been in ruins for at least 30 years, likely longer.

The Song of the Day is "Standing In The Doorway" from Bob Dylan's 1997 album "Time Out Of Mind". Hear a live version on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOooY4ZMJgg">YouTube</a>.
