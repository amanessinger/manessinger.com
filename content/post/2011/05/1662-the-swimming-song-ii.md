It's swimming season again. The water is still cold and the various web pages don't report water temperature values. The only page that lists any value at all, reports 13-16 degrees Celsius.

Well, I'd vote for 16, and I must know, because I was swimming today. It was a bright, hot and clear day and I swam for at least ten minutes. Smells like Summer. Yummy!!! 

 This image is of some ferns on our place at the lake. They were all in a uniform yellowish green, so I thought, what the heck, forget colors, let's go black'n'white and play with tonal values. Hmm ... kinda like what I see.

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/loudon_wainwright_iii/swimming_song.html">The Swimming Song</a>" from Eddi Reader's 1992 solo debut "Mirmama" was already Song of the Day back in "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/06/241-swimmer.html">241 - The Swimmer</a>". At that time I could provide not even a sound sample, but today I found the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HQ1S4K5ydw">YouTube</a>.
