Paul Lester <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/2011/05/07/loving-the-fog/">likes fog</a>. So do I. Sometimes. Once or twice a year. I think fog is nice as long as it is a rare phenomenon, but if not, if it comes in September and does not leave before April, the sensation pretty soon wears off. 

 Here's some fog that didn't exist. I don't know why, but when I processed this image, I suddenly asked myself whether some fog could probably improve the image. Well, I think it does.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/make_believe_mambo_orisa.html">Make Believe Mambo</a>" from David Byrne's 1989 album "Rei Momo". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YU0_1ddQSU">YouTube</a>.
