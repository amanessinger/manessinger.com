Here's another post, and while I at least processed the the image of the last post yesterday evening, this one has been waiting to be used for almost two months. It's from the session in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1514-silence.html">1514 - Silence</a>". I always wanted to use it one day, well, this is the day ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "Silence Is Sexy" from the 2000 EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten album of the same name. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hex6IErt9do">video</a>.
