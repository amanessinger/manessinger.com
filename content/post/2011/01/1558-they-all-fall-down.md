Same alley as yesterday's door, same situation:

 A place, where I go by about every other day, a detail, that I've see a hundred times, finally it made "click" and everything fell into place.

The Song of the Day is "They All Fall Down" from the 2010 Creepshow album of the same name. Good stuff, but hear for yourself on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXHyuuR8dpQ">YouTube</a>.
