After three days of silence, here's a post for Monday. Sorry, I was quite busy, but now I am on the train to Carinthia. Tomorrow is a Catholic (and therefore public, go figure) holiday in Austria, Friday I've taken off, thus this will be a long weekend.

Originally I had expected to not make an image on Monday, but that did not trouble me the least. Late Sunday night I had already begun to work on some more images from may Saturday New Year's Walk. Remember that I told you of mounds of snow with the trees on top? 

 Well, that will have to wait for another day, because on Monday, after work, I fooled around with unfocused night images taken at maximum aperture, and the image that you see above is one of the results. I liked it too much to throw it away ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Get What's Coming" from the new Creepshow album "They All Fall Down". Hear it (plus the intro to the album) on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiiaLSXkGQA">YouTube</a>. A bit on the hard side, but good stuff!
