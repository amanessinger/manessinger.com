Today I was down by the river again, and you may see some images of that tomorrow (as I am frequently reluctant to go out on Sundays), but for today's post I want to share what I saw when driving home. 

 Fortunately the Nikon 70-300 is part of my weekend kit, so I had no problem capturing the sight from far down in the valley. <a target="_blank" href="/tag/dobratsch">Dobratsch</a> is the mountain, and when you look close, you can even see the church on the summit, more prominently featured in "<a target="_blank" href="/2008/02/491-just-in-time.html">491 - Just In Time</a>".

The Song of the Day is "It's A Fire" from "Dummy", the 1994 debut album of Portishead. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y26KpgZknY">YouTube</a>.
