These white frames? No idea. At the moment I simply feel they are appropriate. Don't know why, they just feel good and I like the idea of experimenting with frames and what they do to an image. Don't like it? Don't worry, like everything, it will pass ðŸ˜„

I didn't have many images today, about ten, and this was one that I had already written off. I had taken it a second too late, I was too far away, and only when I looked at it later, I found this to be another instance of a usable square hidden in an otherwise unusable image.

 You could say this is a kind of cheating, kind of framing the image and thus taking the photograph after the fact. Well, you'd be absolutely right, but for me that's part of the pleasure. 

Today I was fast as well, but then, choosing a song and a title, I lost much more time than I had saved in the first place. Oh well.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/noir_desir/le_vent_nous_portera.html">Le Vent Nous Portera</a>" from the 2001 <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noir_D%C3%A9sir">Noir DÃ©sir</a> album "Des Visages Des Figures". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIkXK6rxt4c">YouTube</a>.
