Delayed again, I'm sorry. My absence even caused <a target="_blank" href="http://ajesse.blogspot.com/">Anita</a> to inquire about my health. Thanks, I'm fine, maybe a little tired.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110106_143536_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110106_143536_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On Thursday I went for another walk along the river, this time a much longer distance along the southern shore, up to the next bridge and then back on the other side, something between eight and ten kilometers.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110106_163448_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110106_163448_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Again I came back with almost 200 images, but this time the weather was not as clear and the light most of the time flat.I probably could find some more images worth processing, but I think I can leave it as well at three.

The probably most interesting thing was the spider. I saw her, sitting in the not very warm sun on a stone, and when I tried to take an image, she first ran away. It took some chasing and coercion until I finally got the image that you see here. Interesting. I never knew that spiders are active during winter.

 The water image is deliberately over-saturated, because, well, I think it looks good ðŸ™‚

No, really, it was already very dark when I took the image, even at the camera's white balance maximum of 10000K the image had a ghastly blue cast, and I am surprised myself, how much I could get out of it in Photoshop.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nick_cave_and_the_bad_seeds/let_the_bells_ring.html">Let The Bells Ring</a>" from Nick Cave's 2004 masterpiece "Abattoir Blues / Lyre Of Orpheus".
