As I said in my last post, I did get out on Sunday, and I even made some pictures ðŸ™‚

This is really the post for yesterday, Monday, but, well, compared to Sunday's images, my results of yesterday are somewhat lacking.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110123_153357_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110123_153357_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It is the same river as always, river Gail, south of mount <a target="_blank" href="/tag/dobratsch">Dobratsch</a>. It's interesting, this place keeps and keeps me coming back. River and snow - a recurring theme this winter.

 On Sunday I started out later and walked a longer distance on a way through the forest. When I arrived at the river, it was further upstream than I had intended, and due to the direction of the river bend, I had almost no direct sun. As a result I had less images, but I really like these two, and especially the reflection of the clouds in the Image of the Day, along with the small wave in the foreground.

The Song of the Day is the Billie Holiday classic "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/i_cover_the_waterfront.html">I Cover The Waterfront</a>", this time performed by Anita O'Day on her 1954 album "Songs by Anita O'Day" (reissued as "An Evening with Anita O'Day"). I've uploaded it to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDfbWRPNYvQ">YouTube</a>. Enjoy.
