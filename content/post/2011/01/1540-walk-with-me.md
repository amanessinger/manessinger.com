Time goes by, here we have a new year and I'm already late ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110101_150216_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110101_150216_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This is the second of two posts for today, both with pictures taken on my New Year's Walk.

It was a bright, sunny day, but having risen only shortly before noon, I did not get out before 1 pm, too late to take the car and drive a longer distance. Instead I decided to just take a walk.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110101_150652_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110101_150652_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I was outside until sundown. I did not cover a long distance, in fact although I know where I was, I still wonder that I it took me three hours for such a laughably short walk, but then, I took about 200 images in that time.

The Image of the Day was taken on the bridge across the river, the other two images were taken on the southern shore, along with the images that are coming with the next post.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/devil_doll/walk_with_me.html">Walk With Me</a>" from the 2003 Devil Doll album "Queen of Pain". Again, this is not the Slovenian / Italian band of Mr. Doctor, but the band of American singer Colleen Duffy.

I could not find the album version, so here's only a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViFPubd-Ob0">live version</a> of mediocre quality.
