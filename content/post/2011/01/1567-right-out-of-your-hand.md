 Here's one more image tonight, this time one taken today.

 It is dark now outside. I am on the train from Vienna to Carinthia, two hours later than usual. I had already been on the train at the usual time, only to discover, that I had left my laptop at work. Silly me. I left the train in the last moment, returned to work, and finally went back to the station for the next train.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nick_cave/right_out_of_your_hand.html">Right Out Of Your Hand</a>" from the 2003 Nick Cave album "Nocturama". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StauimZN1KA&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
