Can you digest one more post today? Again it is a series of older images, and precisely it is the end of the series that I took on December, 19. You saw the other images in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1527-skating-away-on-the-thin-ice-of-the-new-day.html">1527 - Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day</a>", "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1529-broken-stones.html">1529 - Broken Stones</a>", "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1532-a-christmas-song.html">1532 - A Christmas Song</a>" and in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1534-and-then-so-clear.html">1534 - And Then So Clear</a>".

Images of one day spread over five posts, I hear you say? Well, yes, I know, this completely breaks with the idea of one image per day taken that day, but on the other hand, posting all 13 images on one day would have been a perfect waste of good images, and besides, it took me some days to even process them.

 It's as it is, and due to the fact that I haven't done much more today than playing with the iPad and later cooking, I didn't have much choice anyway ðŸ™‚

The iPad, you ask? Well, whatever else it is, it is certainly the perfect portfolio device ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "The End", not the Doors song from their first album, but another song from "Happyland", the debut album of Swedish singer Amanda Jenssen. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz7fdu5LiLk">live video</a>.
