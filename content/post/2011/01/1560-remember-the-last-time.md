Well, you'd have to be a very regular reader of this blog, to remember the series of waterfall images, that I did early on. It started with "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/01/80-quake-in-gorgeous-gorge.html">80 - Quake in a Gorgeous Gorge</a>" and was followed up by "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/01/85-down-again.html">85 - Down Again</a>",  "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/01/86-probing-deeper.html">86 - Probing Deeper</a>" and "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/01/87-substitutions.html">87 - Substitutions</a>", all from the same location, a gorge in the forest.

I don't live there any more, but it is not far away and because I had business in the area yesterday, I thought, why not go down for half an hour? I left my bag in the car and took only the Sigma 8-16, which restricted me slightly, but made climbing up again an easier task ðŸ™‚

Again I have used a border, although I feel that a thin white border is more appropriate this time. Hmm ... it probably would have done without as well. Call it a fad ðŸ™‚

 Btw: the situation looks more dramatic than it actually was. The camera was only an inch above the water, so I ran no risk of getting wet. The lens though did ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day, "Remember The Last Time", is from another album, that I have wanted to link to for ages. It's "The Bleeding Edge" by "The Revelations featuring Tre Williams". This particular song is not on YouTube, so let me link to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/artist?a=4oVf-d_DwKBCwvBOwdwRyk_FeKsYVOH1">a series of four other songs</a> from the same album instead.
