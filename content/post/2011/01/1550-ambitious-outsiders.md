Tell you, sometimes this concept of titles and songs really, really sucks. I've just spent hours looking for a title, and then the best thing I could come up with was this: "Ambitious Outsiders"! Really, and what shall that mean in the first place, huh???

 The real problem is this: I have not the faintest idea what this image is about. I like it. It has an abstract quality, something that transcends the immediate subject. It is more a pattern than a depiction of something. It does not tell a story, but neither does a Mondrian. It's only: How can you find a title for something like that? 

The Song of the Day is "Ambitious Outsiders" from the 1997 Morrissey album "Maladjusted". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_MyuHhxoEg">YouTube</a>.
