Patience is a virtue. A <a target="_blank" href="/2011/01/1553-frownland.html">few days ago</a> I used this title for the first time, used it for an image where it didn't really fit (although its colors matched those of "Trout Mask Replica" amazingly well), just because I'd had the album sitting around for a week, waiting to be used.

 Well, I should have known better. Sooner or later I find the image for every song that I want to present. For "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/captain_beefheart/frownland.html">Frownland</a>", the opener of Captain Beefheart's milestone album, it would probably have been today. 

If you haven't heard the song yet, no problem, it's still on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kme3Y1RpmUg">YouTube</a> ðŸ˜„
