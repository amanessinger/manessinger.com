We had rain in the morning. Warm rain, to be precise. All snow in Vienna is long gone, but I suppose there will still be some of it left in Carinthia.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110114_084134_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110114_084134_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On a rainy day I always crave for colors, and so these strong reds and the yellow concrete mixer came perfectly right.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/captain_beefheart/frownland.html">Frownland</a>", the opener of "Trout Mask Replica", one of the most influential albums of all time, a milestone even in Don Van Fleet's work. I freely admit, I didn't know it, but last week this regrettable situation came to an end. 

The album is currently not available as digital downloads, I have no idea why, most of his work is, so I had to fall back to plastic. After three weeks the CD has finally arrived. Oh well, I had a hard time waiting. Hear the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kme3Y1RpmUg">YouTube</a> until your copy arrives ðŸ™‚
