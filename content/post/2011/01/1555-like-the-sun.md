 Here's the second post of tonight. The image was taken today, I had plenty of others, but it is one more time an image with the sun inside the frame and pretty nice clouds.

 Later, when I was back home, I went out on the balcony and watched the sun go down behind distant mountains. I like the sun ðŸ™‚

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/z/zucchero/like_the_sun_from_out_of_nowhere.html">Like The Sun</a>" is also the title of the Song of the Day, a piece from the 2006 compilation "Zucchero & Co.", a collection of the Italian superstar's duets with people as diverse as Sting, John Lee Hooker, Luciano Pavarotti or, on this song, Macy Gray and Jeff Beck. A good song from a great album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQM6AOh9Y8I">YouTube</a>.
