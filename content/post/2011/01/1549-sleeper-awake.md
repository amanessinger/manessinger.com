Oh dear, I made exactly two images today. In the end I found a usable square in one of them (remember: there's a usable square in every image!), and with some extras from onOne Software's Photo Frame, I even got something like a picture. The asymmetry of the frame nicely balances the weird optical illusion introduced by the oblique parallels of the window blinds.

 The Song of the Day is "Sleeper Awake" from Sarah Blasko's new album "As Day Follows Night". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtKDP3NOhm0">YouTube</a>.
