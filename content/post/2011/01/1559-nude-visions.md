I had to go to Carinthia one day earlier and here I am now. The image is from this morning in Vienna though. 

You remember, I had two images of film / concert ads recently, "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1530-happy-together.html">1530 â€“ Happy Together</a>" and "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1531-hop-skip-and-jump.html">1531 â€“ Hop, Skip and Jump</a>". Well, here's another memorable combo ðŸ˜„

 You certainly know the image on the poster that's half covered. The other one? No idea ðŸ˜›

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/talking_heads/totally_nude.html">Totally Nude</a>" from the 1988 Talking Heads album "Naked". 1988??? Wow!!!

Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2o1UGngPjo">YouTube</a>.
