Finally here's an image of today, taken this evening on my way home from work. The whole day we had a mix of snow and rain, but in the end the rain won and the snow is already gone again.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/too_much_between_us.html">Too Much Between Us</a>" from the 1967 Procol Harum album "A Salty Dog". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtuTWPNKY2w">YouTube</a>.

Well, that's it for today, and I can tell you, it feels damn good to be done again with the backlog ðŸ™‚
