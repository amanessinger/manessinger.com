No mounds of snow either. These are two images of yesterday, Tuesday, morning.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110104_083754_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110104_083754_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> You've seen the bike a few days ago in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1537-round-and-around.html">1537 - Round And Around</a>", then together with another one, today decorated with some plastic flowers.

 The image of the day is one of those that I make often and publish rarely. I don't know why, maybe because this kind of view upwards has always fascinated me and therefore has always been present in my photography, to a point where I have felt it become repetitious, but then, something continuously draws me to take those images, and so I guess it's OK to publish them once in a while.

Apart from that, this image gives me an (admittedly weak, but nevertheless) excuse to point you to a record, that has been waiting much too long for such an opportunity. "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elton_john/never_too_old_to_hold_somebody.html">Never Too Old (To Hold Somebody)</a>" is from the recent Elton John / Leon Russell collaboration "The Union". Here's the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMncry64Xl8">YouTube</a>.
