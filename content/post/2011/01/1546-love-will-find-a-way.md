You who follow my struggles, you know how heroic a fight I fought, but in the end I have lost. Or won.

I've got an iPad. Or better: my father has, but he still doesn't know and technically I have it. I won't keep it though.

Years ago I bought a "digital picture frame" for my parents. They are not computer-literate, have no Internet access, don't understand English and can't follow my blog. A picture frame seemed like a good idea, but really, it was not. Its resolution was too low, the user interface more than clunky, the colors way off and contrast terrible. This did not particularly bother my parents, but it bothered me.

Looking for a replacement, I suddenly had the idea, that an iPad probably could be a much better picture frame than anything dedicated to that purpose only. The reason is the interface.

I tried it in the store, tried different stores, until I found an iPad with maybe a hundred photos on it. It did feel slick. Absolutely slick, and it was easy as well. Much easier than fiddling with a picture frame's remote control. And the best thing is, whenever you get stuck, something happens that you don't understand, there is one single button. You press it and you are back on the home screen.

 I bought the 16GB WiFi-only variant, i.e. the cheapest, and then I began researching, installing, trying, playing around, and that's the reason why my posts were so delayed. At the moment I am looking for apps that may be useful for my father, even without Internet connection. One of them is an offline maps application, and today I have downloaded maps of Carinthia.

The Image of the Day was taken Friday afternoon in a forest east of Klagenfurt. I like the horizontal layers in the background and the almost curtain-like vertical pattern of the trees.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lionel_richie/love_will_find_a_way.html">Love Will Find A Way</a>" from the 1983 Lionel Richie album "Can't Slow Down". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H48W_eWGtWM">YouTube</a>.
