This was an extremely stressful weekend, but successful nevertheless. I spent most of the time programming and researching technical problems. I'm going to blog about that on my programming blog soon.

It's Sunday night now, I am on the train to Vienna, and this is an image that I took on a short excursion this afternoon. It's a merge of three exposures from a series of seven bracketed pictures. 

There was wind, the small twigs were moving, and even though I tried my best (just as Photoshop's align function did), there were some mis-alignments. Contemplating my options I tried Topaz Clean, and there an effect that I probably have not used a single time. It's one of those fractal algorithms, that turn your image into a curly pattern. See on <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/clean/">their web site</a>, it's what they call "Unique and Stylized Edge Manipulation".


Well, it works. Of course it's a canned effect (although you do have some control), but - interestingly enough - it tends to look pretty natural, at least from a distance and at the sizes that I show on the web. At 100% it looks ... interesting, and I guess it would look pretty good in a print.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/white_stripes/broken_bricks.html">Broken Bricks</a>" from the 1999 self-titled White Stripes debut album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cYJqCtDRTk">YouTube</a>.
