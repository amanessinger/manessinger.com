Have you recognized it's Spring again? Yeah, yeah, I know, only on this side of the ball ðŸ˜„

 Sometimes working on an image, seeing how everything falls in place, how something that could not possibly work suddenly begins to work, sometimes it just gives me bliss, and it may even compensate for having put up such an image as yesterday's ðŸ˜›

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/muse/bliss.html">Bliss</a>" is from the 2001 Muse album "Origin Of Symmetry". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5CbhCSnv38">YouTube</a>.
