OK, I'll stop bothering you with yesterday's rain images. Unfortunately if today was anything, it was worse than yesterday.

 But that's what archives are for, right? Here is one more image from our recent trip to Italy, again one that wouldn't fit into the series in "<a target="_blank" href="/2011/02/1594-we-came-along-this-road.html">1594 â€“ We Came Along This Road</a>".

The Song of the Day is one of the most beautiful Rolling Stones songs, hard to imagine that it is an outtake from "Exile On Main Street". You find it on the bonus disc of the 2010 Deluxe Edition. Money well spent, but hear for yourself on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZg4Ai3Mq1o">YouTube</a>.
