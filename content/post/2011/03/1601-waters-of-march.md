Today was a beautiful, sunny day, but somehow I completely lacked inspiration. It was more or less routine that made me go out and try a new location at the river.


It turned out to be a much less interesting place than I had thought, but while I was there I made some image of the water of a small creek that runs into the river. I used a polarizer to cut back the glare and slow down shutter speed. In post-processing I originally went for color, but in the end I decided to use toned B&W.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jane_monheit/waters_of_march.html">Waters Of March</a>" from Holly Cole's 2008 self-titled album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQj0dWr9Vs">YouTube</a>.
