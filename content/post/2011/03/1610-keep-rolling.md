<a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted</a> uses <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alienskin.com/snapart/">Alien Skin Snap Art</a> all the time, well, he is a real master in it and he's even <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alienskin.com/snapart/case-studies_byrne.aspx">featured</a> on Alien Skin's site.

For me it is one of the tools that I use rarely, but sometimes it is a nice way to express my joy of light. Today we had a warm spring day and the light in the morning was blindingly bright. These are the occasions when I grab for Snap Art.

 Interesting. I can't really pin down why I connect this kind of processing with joy, but fact is I do. It must be something about childhood. It looks like an illustration, but then it does not. In a way these images look timeless, don't they? Timeless like a childhood long gone and ever present.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_nutini/keep_rolling.html">Keep Rolling</a>" from Paolo Nutini's 2009 album "Sunny Side Up". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWdPFC55BIg">YouTube</a>.
