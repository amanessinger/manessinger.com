It's morning and I should be off to work, so let's keep this short.

I've long waited for an opportunity to present you a fascinating album that did not lend itself to my purpose easily. The song titles just wouldn't match.

 In 2009 Marc Almond recorded "Orpheus In Exile ~ The Songs Of Vadim Kozin". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadim_Kozin">Vadim Kozin</a> was a Russian tenor singer who, during the years of Stalin's terror, was sentenced to jail, and who spent the rest of his life in Magadan, a city in Russia's far east, that was administrative center and gateway to the Gulag. A wonderful album, really worth a try. 

The Song of the Day is "I Love So Much To Look Into Your Eyes". I couldn't find it on YouTube, so I have uploaded it and so far it seems to last ðŸ™‚
