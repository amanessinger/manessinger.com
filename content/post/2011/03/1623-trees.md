When I bought the Panasonic DMC-LX5, I was primarily interested in the option to make square images and, more important, to compose in 1:1 aspect ratio.

The LX5 has this little switch on top of the lens barrel, that lets you choose between the four supported aspect ratios, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2 and 16:9. Honestly, I never thought I would use that, but in practice it turns out to be one of the great features of this camera. It's accessible, it's usable quickly, it is usable even without taking the eye from the viewfinder. That's great and that's the reason why it will be used. Features that are not easily accessible won't get used. This gets used.


The Song of the Day is "Trees" by Bunny Berigan, a trumpet player who played with Tommy Dorsey and also had his own band. The track is available on numerous compilations, "Night Song" is just one of them and it happens to have decent quality.
