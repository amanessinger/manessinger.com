I'm on the train to Carinthia and this is for the color fans again. In the morning I saw this artificial flower on a bicycle.

 Other than that, well, there's not much meaningful that one can say, confronted with a tragedy like the one that hit Japan today, so I dedicate this flower to all the victims there.

The Song of the Day is one more time "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bobby_darin/artificial_flowers.html">Artificial Flowers</a>" from the 1996 Beautiful South album "Blue Is the Colour".
