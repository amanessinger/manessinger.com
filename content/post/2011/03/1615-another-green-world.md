Uhh, you guess it, I have not a single image of today ðŸ™‚

Weather was not really worth going out. I went anyway, although much too late in the afternoon, and in the end I spent my time at the local electronics market, wondering if I should buy a Panasonic LX-5. Well, I kept wondering for months now, and in the end I never do it. I know, it's stupid, I should either buy the damn thing and use it like <a target="_blank" href="http://lightscrape.blogspot.com/">Juha</a> does, or else just stop thinking about it, but of course I don't. 

The LX-5 is just such an admirable piece of technology, and it has exactly the size that I would want for a second camera. I have tried the Olympus PEN E-PL2, and while I like it, it is already too heavy and big. The new Olympus XZ-1 is nice and I guess I like its ergonomics better than that of the Panasonic, but then, the LX-5 goes wider.

In fact, when I look at my work of the last 16 months, a vast majority of my images has been taken with the Tamron 17-50/2.8, so obviously this zoom range (25.5-75 mm equivalent) is perfect for most of my work. The LX-5 offers 24-90/2.0-3.3, thus it's not only longer, its lens is even very fast, and when you go into macro mode, it focuses down to 1 cm. I suppose, although I don't need it at all, I'll keep thinking about it ðŸ˜„

 The Image of the Day is from last Summer in Liguria, Italy.

Not all of Italy is lush, but Liguria certainly is. Lots of rain, we got some of it, but I absolutely love the landscape. I still have lots of those images processed, uploaded, but not yet used in a blog post. Perfect for a Saturday like this, when I write programs instead of taking photographs.

The Song of the Day, "Another Green World" from Brian Eno's album of the same name, as you can hear on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36B225lLvY4">YouTube</a>, is not much of a song at all, but I like the album and, well, on a gloomy day like this, I like the title even more ðŸ™‚
