I don't know why, but toned B&W fascinates me at the moment. This is now the fifth picture in a row, I guess this is the longest series of B&W images that I've ever made. Seems like it's getting to be a habit with me ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/youre_getting_to_be_a_habit_with_me.html">You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me</a>". YouTube has about a million versions by Diana Krall and two or three by Frank Sinatra (well, not that bad, but bad nevertheless), thus I thought I'd upload something different: Betty Carter in February 1958 in New York City, taken from the 1992 compilation "I Can't Help It". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulM9E_TxehA">YouTube</a>. Well, at least as long as you don't live in Germany. Oh dear!
