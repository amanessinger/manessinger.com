Just as I replied to <a target="_blank" href="http://meanderingpassage.com/">Earl's</a> comment on the last post: I made hardly any images today, so here's another one in this frosty series. You see, I definitely wanted to get the sun into the frame, and as always when using an ultra-wide, I tried different foregrounds.

 Colors are more rusty again, but warmth was not intended ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is again "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madonna/frozen.html">Frozen</a>" from Madonna's 1998 "Ray Of Light" album and the video is still on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXFHf8xZ1CA">YouTube</a>.
