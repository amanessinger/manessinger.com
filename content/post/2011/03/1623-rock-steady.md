Yes, yes, I know, this is no proper Image of the Day. This is just a test image, but this is part of my review of the Panasonic DMC-LX5, and the technical data of this image are quite remarkable.

I was standing down in the garage, my back leaning against a pillar, the elbows braced against the body, the camera held in the most steady position, and it took me four attempts to get this image, but still:


ISO 80, f2 and 1s. Yeah, that's right. One second. Hand-held.

How's image stabilization on this camera, you ask? Remarkable, I say ðŸ˜›

Shooting at f2 with a DSLR brings a considerable DOF penalty, thus even though you may get a sharp image, the depth of field is so shallow, that the image frequently still looks wrong. The smaller sensor of the LX5 captures a higher DOF, thus f2 is perfectly usable, as you see.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aretha_franklin/rock_steady.html">Rock Steady</a>" from the 1972 album "Young, Gifted And Black" by the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin.
