This is a fence near Villach. Yesterday was a clear day with bright blue sky, but somehow it didn't appeal to me. When I finally went out, it was cold and the light was already deteriorating.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/fleet_foxes/ragged_wood.html">Ragged Wood</a>" from the 2008 self-titled Fleet Foxes album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-CEfY9CDLw">YouTube</a>.
