I probably would have had some images for today, and for sure at least one would have been better than that of <a target="_blank" href="/2011/02/1593-give-me-your-sou.html">last Friday</a>, but somehow these images of yesterday keep me occupied. By now I have four of them processed and here is number two. The others will follow soon.

 A cooler interpretation, the yellows shifted more towards green, but as I say so often, you really wouldn't want to see what the camera saw, believe me ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is still "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madonna/frozen.html">Frozen</a>" from Madonna's 1998 "Ray Of Light" album. Even the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXFHf8xZ1CA">YouTube</a> is the same ðŸ™‚
