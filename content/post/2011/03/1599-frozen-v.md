Slowly this series comes to an end. This is the second to last. Here is a slightly more realistic rendition of the scene. I have hardly introduced colors and instead concentrated on contrast in snow and ice.

 The Song of the Day stays the same, it is again "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madonna/frozen.html">Frozen</a>" from Madonna's 1998 "Ray Of Light" album, but for a change the video today is from her <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pAMOw0iGdw">2001 Drowned World Tour</a>.
