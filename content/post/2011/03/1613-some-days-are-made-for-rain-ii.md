It's late Friday afternoon, I am on the train to Carinthia, and here is another image of yesterday.  

 It's still rain, but this time I tried to get as much color out of it as I could.

The Song of the Day is still "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aaron_neville/some_days_are_made_for_rain.html">Some Days Are Made For Rain</a>" by Aaron Neville and if you have not heard it yet, the link still points to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9A5Wxd8VKs">YouTube</a>.
