And here's one more B&W image.

I am still in Carinthia and will go to Vienna tomorrow. Today I had some errands to run, and while doing so, I found time for some images.

 The Song of the Day is the beautiful "Widow's Grove" from Tom Waits' 2006 masterpiece "Orphans". It's incredible how good this triple album really is. We had it some times in the past, this will not be the last time ðŸ™‚
