Thanks for all the good wishes, I'm already feeling better now. Not yet well but better.

I can't sleep all day and night, though I did on Monday and most of Tuesday, thus it's probably a good time to begin posting again.

This is an image made on Saturday. It was not the only image, but it shows what I like in DSLRs. DSLRs? Yeah, I've put the Panasonic LX5 on a shelf in Carinthia, mounted the Sigma 50/1.4 on my D300 and went out to make DSLR-ish  images. Here's one of those that I had in mind, in the next posts we will see that this is far from my current mode of seeing though.

Using such a fast lens wide open (and the Sigma is optimized for that purpose) lets you focus on an extremely thin layer of reality. It's almost like peeling an onion. You concentrate on a thin slice and the rest vanishes in a creamy blur.

Our eyes don't see like that, and this is probably a reason why such images fascinate us. It's focus and concentration at the same time. I have made a lot of these images in the past and I want to get back to that at times, strive for a mix between the convenient bliss that is the LX5, and the spartan restriction in using a fast prime on the D300. 

 This is where a DSLR excels. Nothing but this. The rest of the images that you'll see in the following posts were all made on Sunday, were made with the same lens, and most of them could have been made with the LX5 as well. This one not.

 The Song of the Day is "Glass Onion" from the "White Album". If you really need the digital downloads, you can get the exclusively from the iTunes store, but I won't link into the Heart of Darkness ðŸ™‚
