Just something I saw today, but I think it fits the title and the slightly hysterical mood of the Song of the Day ðŸ™‚

 When I learned of Klaus Nomi's existence, he was already dead. That's not remarkable by itself, but Klaus Nomi's death was a matter of great public attention, because he was one of the first prominent victims of AIDS, and for me it was the first time that I heard of the disease at all. It was also a deep cut into my romantic ideas of sexual relationship. I remember it as kind of an Expulsion from Paradise. It was the summer of 1983, I was 19 years at that time, and probably this is what gave it additional importance to me.

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBPczcZYp_Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
