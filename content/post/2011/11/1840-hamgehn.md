It's Tuesday night. November 1<sup>st</sup>, "All Saints", is a public holiday in catholic Austria, I took Monday off and had a long weekend. This image was taken Monday morning in the staircase leading to a lawyer's office. Reminds me of my recent reading of Kafka ðŸ™‚

 For a change, the Song of the Day is in no way connected to the image. I don't know why I chose the title, it's just a song from the last album that I got, "Hamgehn" from the 2011 self-titled Talltones album. The Talltones are a Carinthian group playing a mixture of Carinthian folk music, Tom Waits and Jazz. Great music, see the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPPBtT-1djU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
