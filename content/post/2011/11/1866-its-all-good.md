Today we had sunshine in Villach. This was a first in a few weeks, every other day since having been foggy and gloomy.

 I still didn't make a lot of pictures. What I found out though is, that the JPEG engine of the FZ-150 is excellent. I hardly can produce anything better than the camera's JPEGs, even if I work from RAW. This does not mean that I will use the camera's JPEGs, but at least in terms of image quality there is not much to be expected.

There are still enough reasons to use RAW though. Setting your own white balance is a good one and there are others. In general, as soon as you want to take your image into Photoshop, RAW is the safe way to go.

The Song of the Day is "Its All Good" from Bob Dylan's 2009 album "Together Through Life". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-HDNthMRww" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
