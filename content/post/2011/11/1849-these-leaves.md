Frankly, I suspect I've made better images, but then, I'm absolutely sure I had even worse. It's already Friday, I'm on the train to Carinthia and I have to get three posts out of the pipeline. Excuse me, good material is scarce and I don't feel picky today ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "These Leaves" from Austrian singer Coshiva's 2008 debut album "Butterfly". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZSKZonJLtU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
