Wednesday, before I left home for work, I looked out of my living room window onto a bleak, foggy sky. There was no need to lament a lack of colors though. It only lasts for a very short time. Some years I miss this moment, some years not. This year not.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elton_john/theres_no_tomorrow.html" target="_blank">There's No Tomorrow</a>" from "The Union", the 2010 collaboration of Elton John and Leon Russell. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVgDRnyZJ8U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
