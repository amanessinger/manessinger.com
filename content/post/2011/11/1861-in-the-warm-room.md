I'm back in Vienna and I took the Panasonic LX5 with me. Only the LX5. I can't even tell why, I just did, and it feels very, very good to use it again.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111121_175516_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111121_175516_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> One thing though: If you happen to have big hands like mine, forget about using it with gloves. I have nice, soft nappa leather gloves with cashmere inlet and I have no problem wearing them while using the D300. No chance with the LX5's tiny buttons though. 

 As to the images, well, it's quite unsettling to walk through a street at night and to suddenly see a Caterpillar where last week a house was.

The Image of the Day is from the steamy window of a greek restaurant around the corner. I love the contrast between the warmth behind the windows and the coolness of the sun-bleached ads for vacations in Greece.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/in_the_warm_room.html" target="_blank">In The Warm Room</a>" from Kate Bush's 1978 second album "Lionheart". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INcgLrizYGQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
