I was working most of the day in the new apartment, so I didn't miss the sun that much, but when I finally found a little time in the afternoon, some streaks of sunlight would have been nice.

 Well, it didn't happen today and it didn't happen during most of the weekend, with the exception of yesterday. This is typical November weather in Carinthia. High fog all day, but when you take the time to drive up a mountain, the sun comes out at around 1000 meters above sea level and you have beautiful blue sky. It's only that I lack the time ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "A Foggy Day" by Frank Sinatra and Willie Nelson, released on the 1984 album "Duets II". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faq44rh7Frk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
