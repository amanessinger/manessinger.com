Here's one last image, this one finally made today. 

I can't really tell why I took this particular image. There is something in the arrangement of the brooms, the bicycle, the stairs leading up to the small church, and then that tag "Future", that immediately caught my eye. I made two images, one wider than this, but this is it, this is the core of what attracted me. Don't ask me why ðŸ™‚

 We had "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_bowie/a_better_future.html" target="_blank">A Better Future</a>" from David Bowie's 2002 album "Heathen" two times so far, in the pretty cool "<a href="/2010/02/1223-a-better-future.html" target="_blank">1223 â€“ A Better Future</a>" and the not so cool "<a href="/2011/08/1753-towards-a-better-future.html" target="_blank">1753 â€“ Towards A Better Future</a>". Here it is again, but why not, it's a great song. Hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boX8zNyhaL4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
