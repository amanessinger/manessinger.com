I made a couple of images this afternoon, some are plagued by dust bunnies (LX5! How I miss ya!) and one of them, this one, is an HDR image. That's one more trick a DSLR's has in its sleeves. I gave it a mild treatment based on Photomatix Pro's Dynamic Range Compression tone mapping method. This is particularly well suited to soft sky gradients. Due to the subject matter we are clearly again in <a target="_blank" href="/tag/electric-ladyland">Electric Ladyland</a>.

 As always the Song of the Day is “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jimi_hendrix/have_you_ever_been_to_electric_ladyland.html">Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)</a>” from Jimi Hendrix’ 1968 album “Electric Ladyland”. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t832ITJuAQg&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
