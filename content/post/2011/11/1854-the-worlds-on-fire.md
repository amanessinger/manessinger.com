Thankfully Sunday afternoon was generous and using the Nikon and the 50/1.4 again inspired me. Makes it easy to get over the week ðŸ™‚

 Here's one image that came out of the camera pretty well. I wanted to add a frame and while I was at it, I've also pushed color contrast a little more.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/housemartins/the_worlds_on_fire.html" target="_blank">The World's On Fire</a>" from the 1987 second Housemartins album "The People Who Grinned Themselves To Death". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r17A0pftiDQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
