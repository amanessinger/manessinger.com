Funny, I couldn't remember what a lousy performer the Sigma 28/1.8 is when the sun is in your frame. It's such a wonderful lens otherwise, and of course such an incredibly useful focal length on APS-C.

 Here's an HDR with the green reflexes edited out (mostly), and the result, while vastly different from what the sensor with any single exposure records, looks remarkably like what I believe to have seen. Same workflow as yesterday.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/further_on_up_the_road.html" target="_blank">Further On (Up The Road)</a>", and of course it's the spectacular version from Springsteen's "Live In Dublin" with the Sessions Band. Enjoy the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrEMuZFAxII" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
