Here's one more from the same greek restaurant, taken tonight. It's less abstract though and I prefer yesterday's image.

 Like yesterday the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/in_the_warm_room.html" target="_blank">In The Warm Room</a>" from Kate Bush's 1978 second album "Lionheart". If you didn't yesterday, you can still hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INcgLrizYGQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
