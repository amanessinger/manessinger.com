I left work late in the evening, here's all I got today.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/handel_george_frideric/11_air_for_bass_the_people_that_walked_in_darkness.html" target="_blank">The People That Walked In Darkness</a>" from Handel's "Messiah". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4T8rI4_Bqo" target="_blank">YouTube</a> in the version of Trevor Pinnock's 1988 recording.
