Funny, I didn't expect Bob Dylan songs ever to come back to YouTube, but here they are. Either someone is frantically uploading faster then Sony or His Bobness can let them be taken down, or Google has reached an agreement. Anyway, it's nice to have him back ðŸ˜„

 This image is from today and the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/everything_is_broken.html" target="_blank">Everything Is Broken</a>" from Bob's 1989 album, produced by Daniel Lanois. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09KIilyePHQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
