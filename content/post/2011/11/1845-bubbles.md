I'm in Carinthia and this weekend is just like the last, shopping all Saturday, working all Sunday. It will have an end, that's clear, but equally clear is, that we are still far from it.

 Here's an image taken on Monday in a Caf√© in Villach.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/james/bubbles.html" target="_blank">Bubbles</a>" from the 2008 James album "Hey Ma". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX22Dma7eMg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
