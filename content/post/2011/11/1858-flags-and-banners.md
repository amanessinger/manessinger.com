On the train to Carinthia. 6 pm and outside it's darkest night. Here are two Urban Dreams captured in the morning.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111118_083558_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111118_083558_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Both of these images wouldn't have been possible with a small-sensor camera like the Panasonic LX5. The image on the left was of a reflection, taken at f1.4 and with the focus somewhere in the weird lines of the reflection. In post-processing I've equalized the tones (the left side was much darker), pushed colors and partially contrast, but nothing of that is regarded as particularly non-photographic.

 The Image of the Day is almost completely a result of Photoshop work. I took an image of an advertising poster with extremely shallow DOF and played around with it, pretty aimless, until I had the idea with the stripes, and from there it became a flag, a turmoil, something burning, a window into a world of warring nations. In the end I liked the result better than the straight photograph, and this is how it ended up as Image of the Day.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/faces/flags_and_banners.html" target="_blank">Flags And Banners</a>" from the 1973 Faces album "Ooh La La". Beautiful song. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmfQDFuZXQQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
