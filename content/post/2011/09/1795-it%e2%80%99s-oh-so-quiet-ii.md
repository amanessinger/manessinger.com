Enough is enough, huh? This is my seventh post for today and I have not even been outside, didn't have the chance to make a single image.

 I have to return to Vienna today, and although the rain has stopped, it is already too late to go swimming. Thus I leave you with another image from yesterday. I couldn't decide, I like both, so here we go.

The Song of the Day is one more time "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lisa_ekdahl/its_oh_so_quiet.html" target="_blank">It's Oh So Quiet</a>" from Lisa Ekdahl's 2002 album "Heaven Earth & Beyond". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMphCjWXOKo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
