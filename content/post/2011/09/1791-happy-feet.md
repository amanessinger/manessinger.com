More and more I find myself wondering about what to do with my D300. The DSLR is in Carinthia now, and during the last week I had again the option to use either this all-weather beast of a camera or the tiny Panasonic LX5. Well, you know what I did. I've hardly used a DSLR in half a year. It really makes me wonder ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110914_110104_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110914_110104_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In addition to these happy feet I leave you with some sole e mare. Both images are probably a little more colorful than real life, but that's how memories are, right?

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_conte/happy_feet.html" target="_blank">Happy Feet</a>" from Paolo Conte's stellar 1990 album "Parole d'Amore Scritte A Macchina". If you don't have a Conte album, this is the one you need. If you have one but not this one, well, you need it anyway ðŸ™‚
