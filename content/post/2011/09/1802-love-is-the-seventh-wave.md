I always carry a second SD card with me. It's a low-spec Kingston card that I initially bought for the LX5 and that I later replaced with a higher-spec (but on that camera not a bit faster) SanDisk card.

Well, today was beautiful and sunny, and although I managed to spend most of the day using the Google surfing the Internets, I still managed to drive down to the lake for swimming. 

 On my way I found a nice view, stopped the car and went out to make some pictures. Only then I found that I had left my card in the card reader. No problem, I thought, that's why I always carry a second card and ,,, 

I didn't find it. I may have stowed it away in some pocket, I may have lost it, it made no difference, I couldn't produce it and the images went untaken. Here's something from Italy instead.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sting/love_is_the_seventh_wave.html" target="_blank">Love is The Seventh Wave</a>" from Sting's 1985 album "The Dream Of The Blue Turtles". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXZistami3c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
