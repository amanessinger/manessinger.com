It's Saturday night, way past eleven, and I have not done much today. I took a few images in the morning, this is one of them, and later in mid-afternoon, when  fog and clouds had vanished, I went swimming again.

Due to the "early winter" on Monday and Tuesday, the water has cooled down to probably even below 20 degrees Celsius, but it's still fine and I'm going to  enjoy it as long as it lasts. Tomorrow for sure, next weekend most likely, at least as long as it doesn't start raining (or worse) again.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beck/the_golden_age.html" target="_blank">The Golden Age</a>" from Beck's 2002 album "Sea Change". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6zAT15vaFk&ob=av2e" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
