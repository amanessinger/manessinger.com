Yesterday afternoon we had a short but heavy thunderstorm here in Carinthia, but it didn't last long enough to cause major damage. I even went swimming later on, and I made this image, being immersed in our lake, but still near enough to the shore that I could easily stand.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lisa_ekdahl/its_oh_so_quiet.html" target="_blank">It's Oh So Quiet</a>" from Lisa Ekdahl's 2002 album "Heaven Earth & Beyond". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMphCjWXOKo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
