Oh dear, it's so insanely late! I've spent the whole day (well, most of it) with my new phone. I could have waited for the iPhone 5, but I don't like Apple's walled garden approach anyway. What I got instead is a Samsung Galaxy S2 16 GB with an extra 16 GB SD card. Nice to have your images, your books, an offline Wikipedia and so much more in your pocket. 

 The Song of the Day is "Warrior" from Rejane Magloire's 2005 album "Forbidden Opera". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7rhosL6ZFw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
