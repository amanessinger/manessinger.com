As (almost) every year, here's the "Summer's Almost Gone" post 😄

This week we already had snow in parts of Austria, <a href="http://en.rian.ru/photolents/20110922/167029376.html" target="_blank">RIA Novosti,</a> the Russian news agency, even found it news-worthy. By the way, it was strongly exaggerated anyway, and of course yesterday all was back to normal. We had a wonderfully sunny late-summer day, I left work early and had dinner in a nice restaurant on the riverside.

 But still, it's hard to ignore the signs. Only the most stubborn folks like me still call this a summer 😄 

As usual the Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/doors/summers_almost_gone.html">Summer's Almost Gone</a>" from the 1968 Doors album “Waiting for the Sun”, just like <a href="/2010/09/1433-summers-almost-gone-iv.html" target="_blank">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/2009/09/1072-summers-almost-gone-iii.html">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/2008/09/699-summers-almost-gone-ii.html">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/2007/09/344-summers-almost-gone.html">here</a>.
