It's Thursday afternoon, it's beautiful outside and I'm on my way to Carinthia. The next two weeks I'll be busy moving, but I hope I'll find at an hour a day to go swimming, at least as long as it's sunny and warm.

 I did take some images today, but mostly I was in a hurry, thus making them typical examples of non-contemplative photography ðŸ™‚

Here's someting from Italy instead.

The Song of the Day is "The Precious Jewel" from the 1997 Charlie Haden / Pat Metheny collaboration "Beyond The Missouri Sky". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExxTAAsuk7s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
