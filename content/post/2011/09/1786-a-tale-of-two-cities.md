After that rant of the last post, here's something easy, a tale of two cities ðŸ™‚

 I took this image today while waiting for the train to Carinthia.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/talking_heads/cities.html" target="_blank">Cities</a>" from the 1979 Talking Heads album "Fear Of Music". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB9W8St1pDc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
