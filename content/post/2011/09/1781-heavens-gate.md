At the moment I'm not terribly productive, neither photographically nor as a programmer, but thankfully I have quite a number of past images that I want to show you and that only now get processed.

This is another image from the monastery of Kladruby. Two days ago we had "<a href="/2011/09/1779-let-there-be-more-light.html" target="_blank">1779 – Let There Be More Light</a>" and from the Czech Republic I posted "<a href="/2011/08/1762-intermezzo-ii.html" target="_blank">1762 – Intermezzo II</a>". Same church, same ceiling, only this time not ultra-wide.

 As regards photography, in general it is forbidden inside of the church, and the only way to get into the church is by attending a conducted tour. Thankfully they sell photo permits though. It was not cheap but that's OK. I'm happy to pay for my hobby and I absolutely recognize how much money goes into such buildings. What I don't understand is, when photography is banned for no reason.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/toni_childs/heavens_gate.html" target="_blank">Heaven's Gate</a>" (that's what these baroque cupolae represented) from Toni Child's 1991 album "House of Hope". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1uMHde0hY8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
