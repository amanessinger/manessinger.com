It's even later now and I have even less to say ðŸ™‚

Oh yes, one thing: don't get worried if I'm not updating for a few days during the next two weeks. I'll be in Carinthia, moving, within Villach only, but nevertheless it will be a lot of work and I may lack time some days.

 The Song of the Day is "Chew-Chew-Chew (Your Bubble Gum)" by Ella Fitzgerald. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUW7UGXTUJw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
