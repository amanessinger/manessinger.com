Nobody had noticed. He drove away and parked the car in the backyard of some empty, rundown factory. There he waited until the phone call came. He didn't recognize the voice, but that was OK. It was not his job to know those people. It was his only job to sit there, wait for the signal, enter the code and push the button. That's what he did.

 He watched the flash, waited for the thunder, and then he started the car, turned around and drove away.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/arcade_fire/suburban_war.html" target="_blank">Suburban War</a>" from the 2010 Arcade Fire album "The Suburbs". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNdqoQWz34E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
