It's Friday, I'm on the train to Carinthia. Here's an image taken in an Underground station while I was on my way to the railway station.

 An orange border, you ask? Well, I was in a hurry (as everyone else) and I did not frame precisely. I cut too much off on the right side, but the border masks it quite well. Half a second, handheld and sharp ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Underground" from the 1983 Tom Waits album "Swordfishtrombones". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciBAMhLiwyQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
