Here's an image taken yesterday night. At first I wanted to post something else, and that's what occupied me last evening.

 You know those moments: you take an image, you think it's excellent, and while you process it, you find out it's not, and no amount of processing can save it.

Well, this is an image I initially did <strong>NOT</strong> deem worthy of a blog post, but now, after having processed it, I do. Initial judgement can be pretty unreliable ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pogues/hells_ditch.html" target="_blank">Hell's Ditch</a>", title song of the 1990 Pogues album produced by Joe Strummer of Clash fame. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPC4kF3uxsc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
