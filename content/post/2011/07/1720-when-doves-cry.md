No idea how this bird lost its head. I admit I find this image ... disconcerting.

 The Song of the Day is the Prince classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/when_doves_cry.html" target="_blank">When Doves Cry</a>". I have a version sung by Cassandra Wilson, but that does not seem to be on sale any more. While looking for it, I found the Song in a fantastic version by Patti Smith, only available on the compilation "Land (1975-2002)", and because I have many songs on that album, I bought this song only. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VfUZFPAC5k" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
