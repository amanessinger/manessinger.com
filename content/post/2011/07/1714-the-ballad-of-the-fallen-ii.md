I'm three days behind and it's already Friday afternoon. I'm on the train to Carinthia and this is the image for Wednesday.

 Like in "1644 - The Ballad of the Fallen", the Song of the Day is "The Ballad of the Fallen" from the 1983 second Liberation Music Orchestra album "The Ballad of the Fallen", featuring Charlie Haden, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Sharon Freeman, Mick Goodrick, Jack Jeffers, Micheal Mantler, Paul Motian, Jim Pepper, Dewey Redman, Steve Slagle and Gary Valente. 

It's one of the best Jazz albums of all times. I have uploaded the title track to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRe1QY6eAzY">YouTube</a> recently.
