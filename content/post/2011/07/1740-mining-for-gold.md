I guess you begin to see a pattern here: this is again no current image, again it was taken from the same bridge as the images in the <a href="/2011/07/1739-rivers-invitation.html" target="_blank">last post</a> and in "<a href="/2011/07/1731-dream-river-ii.html" target="_blank">1731 - Dream River II</a>".

 Straight from the camera the image did not do anything to me, but somehow I wanted to try what I can make of it in Photoshop. I think the result is pretty nice and although it does not at all look like what I saw, it feels like what it should have looked like ðŸ˜„

As to the idea of coloring, that's clearly the result of my exposure to <a href="http://blog.punctumsaliens.ch/2011/07/energy-vector/" target="_blank">Roland's images</a>. Glad he has a blog at last ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cowboy_junkies/mining_for_gold.html" target="_blank">Mining For Gold</a>", either from the Cowboy Junkies' original 1988 "The Trinity Session" album, or from the 2007 "Trinity Revisited". Great music, introduced to me by <a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">my friend Bill Birtch</a>. I've linked to "Trinity Revisited", but honestly, you can't go wrong with either of them. Hear the original version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUhaq4Yg74w" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
