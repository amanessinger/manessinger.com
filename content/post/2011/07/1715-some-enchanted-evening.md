This should be an image of Thursday. It ain't. It's another one made Wednesday. I probably would have had something, but I really like this image better.

 Yes, it has some flares, yes, I could have had less of them if I only had avoided using the split-ND filter (always slightly problematic with the sun in your frame), but I can't help it, this had to be used ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/some_enchanted_evening.html">Some Enchanted Evening</a>" by Frank Sinatra. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJRsGbeW318">YouTube</a>.
