Here's some more in that reckless spirit. In normal colors it didn't do anything to me, but this is a sky like right out of Quake III Arena ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is the Soundgarden classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/soundgarden/black_hole_sun.html" target="_blank">Black Hole Sun</a>", today presented from Paul Anka's 2005 album of mostly very good cover versions "Rock Swings". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEjGgkRbuxI" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has it.

Hell, even the album cover is a nice match ðŸ˜„
