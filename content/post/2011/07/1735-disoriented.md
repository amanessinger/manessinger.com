Yesterday <a href="http://blog.punctumsaliens.ch/" target="_blank">Roland</a> had an image on his blog that was inverted. A night scene became <a href="http://blog.punctumsaliens.ch/2011/07/energy-pathways/" target="_blank">an interesting piece of abstract art</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110720_191707_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110720_191707_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> When I took this image today, I didn't do it with the intention to follow Roland's lead, but now that I've tried it, I like the result better than the original. While Roland's image used a straight inversion, this one uses the Photoshop curves preset "Color Negative".

 The Song of the Day is "Disoriented" from a two CD remastered release of Michelle Shocked's 1988 album "Short Sharp Shocked". The second CD contains alternative versions of most of the original tracks plus a whole bunch of previously unreleased songs.

Disoriented was not available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YiCkOA0HP8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, now it is ðŸ™‚
