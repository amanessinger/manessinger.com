It's Sunday, I'm on the train back to Vienna. This was a mostly quiet weekend, spent with all kinds of things but photography. Here is an image from two weeks ago, saved for an occasion like this.


The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madeleine_peyroux/between_the_bars.html">Between The Bars</a>" from Madeleine Peyroux' 2004 album "Careless Love". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktNzLg_te4">YouTube</a>.
