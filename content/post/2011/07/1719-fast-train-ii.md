Actually I did make some images yesterday. I did it on the train, and here's one of them, fitting right into my emerging "Fast Train" series.

 The Song of the Day is again the Van Morrison song "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/fast_train.html">Fast Train</a>", sung by Solomon Burke on his 2002 album "Don't Give Up on Me". If you haven't heard it <a target="_blank" href="/2007/07/273-movin-on-fast-train.html">here</a> or <a target="_blank" href="/2011/06/1712-fast-train.html">there</a>, you can hear it now on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcj0cK5O-fk&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
