Are you religious? Well, I'm not. Never was, not even as a child. I love churches though. This is one that I passed this afternoon on my way to our lake. By the way, it's only a few meters from the bridge and the river in <a href="/2011/07/1731-dream-river-ii.html" target="_blank">yesterday's image</a>.


The Song of the Day, its title slightly lacking respect, is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/shane_macgowan_and_the_popes/the_church_of_the_holy_spook.html" target="_blank">The Church Of The Holy Spook</a>" by Shane MacGowan and The Popes from the 1995 album "The Snake". Yes, that's the same guy who was (and now again is) singer of the Pogues. Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxNvT1i3700" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
