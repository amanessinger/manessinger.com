Do you remember the golden water in "<a href="/2011/07/1740-mining-for-gold.html" target="_blank">1740 - Mining For Gold</a>"? Well, I've tried the same procedure with some other images, some of them may turn up on days of need, but today I have something different.

Basically I have tried a few subjects to find out how they lend themselves to gilding. Of course I've tried a landscape as well, this landscape to be precise - and it didn't work at all.

 But then, I had already spent too much time with the image to give it up, and the first thing I did, adding a solid color layer in soft light mode and blending it into the dark tones, produced an interesting image. With some selective dodging and burning and with a selective blur I arrived at what you see, and what can I say, I like it! Here's a <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/orig/2011/20110709_174010_ps_no_border.jpg" target="_blank">full-size version without border</a>. It makes for a nice wallpaper.

The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cowboy_junkies/mining_for_gold.html" target="_blank">Mining For Gold</a>", either from the Cowboy Junkies' original 1988 "The Trinity Session" album, or from the 2007 "Trinity Revisited". Whatever you took as my recommendation last time, now it's the other ðŸ˜„
