Enough diagonals, Ken?

It was pretty warm today, the air feeling liquid like hot sweat. According to the weather forecast the tropical weather will be over tomorrow though. Let's hope summer does not end like last year, when after two hot weeks rain set in in late July, and never really stopped until the end of September. Scary how time is fleeting, huh?

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/white_stripes/youre_pretty_good_looking_for_a_girl.html" target="_blank">You're Pretty Good Looking (For A Girl)</a>" from the 2000 White Stripes album "De Stijl". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PiQOb6cPvw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
