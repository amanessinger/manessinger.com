This should be an image taken Sunday, but it is not. We had pouring rain yesterday, snow down to 1800 meters, in other words, I did not feel like photographing. Well, actually I did. In the morning, when fetching breakfast from the local bakery, I made some images of puddles and raindrops on the windshield, but in the end there was nothing usable.

 Instead here is another image taken on Saturday. It's from the same bridge as "<a href="/2011/07/1731-dream-river-ii.html" target="_blank">1731 â€“ Dream River II</a>", only looking the other way, downstream.

While <a href="/2011/07/1738-walking-along-with-you.html" target="_blank">the last post</a> featured a <em>slightly enhanced</em> image, this one was processed to look as natural as possible.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joe_cocker/rivers_invitation.html" target="_blank">River's Invitation</a>" from the 1969 album "Soul '69" by Aretha Franklin. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCUhg302Btc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
