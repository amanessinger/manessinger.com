One last post for today. This is really an image made this morning, one more fallen warrior.

 The Song of the Day is again "The Ballad of the Fallen" from the 1983 second Liberation Music Orchestra album "The Ballad of the Fallen". It's still incredibly good music and it's still available on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRe1QY6eAzY">YouTube</a>. Hear it while you can ðŸ™‚
