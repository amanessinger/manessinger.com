It's Friday afternoon, I am on the train and have just crossed the border to Carinthia. After a two refreshing hours of sleep I'm ready to post yesterday's image.

 For a change, here's a bike again, this time with little brother and sister. I saw them in the morning on my way to work.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/massive_attack/hymn_of_the_big_wheel.html" target="_blank">Hymn Of The Big Wheel</a>" from the 1991 Massive Attack album "Blue Lines". Great song, hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8JcM_FPfRo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
