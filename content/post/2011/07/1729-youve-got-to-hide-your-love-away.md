Love. That's easy, huh? Sometimes when I look for a Song of the Day, I really have to search for a word that will yield at least one song of my collection, and it does not help that I don't want to re-use songs. I do it for series of related pictures and otherwise if I can't avoid it, but love? Love is in so many of our songs, it's strange for a species so occupied with hate. But then, maybe that's why ðŸ™‚

 Still no Beatles downloads on Amazon? Oh my, His Jobness must have paid a lot for the privilege ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/youve_got_to_hide_your_love_away.html" target="_blank">You've Got To Hide Your Love Away</a>" from the 1965 Beatles album "Help!". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAlrFJbGdgw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
