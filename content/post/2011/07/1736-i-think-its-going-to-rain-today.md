I have quite some images taken <strong>from under an umbrella</strong>, so how's about an image <strong>of an umbrella</strong>?

 Actually this is really from yesterday morning and there was no doubt involved. It undeniably did rain, and the image was taken at the Underground platform while I waited for the train ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/randy_newman/i_think_its_going_to_rain_today.html" target="_blank">I Think It's Going to Rain Today</a>" by Randy Newman. I have it on the 2003 album "The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 1". See a 1979 version with orchestra on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4c54PAzXrM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Good as it gets ðŸ™‚
