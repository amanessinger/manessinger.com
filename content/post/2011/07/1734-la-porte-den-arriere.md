Did I ever mention that I love Cajun music? No? Oh I do, at least as much as Cajun kitchen. Give me a Jambalaya or a Gumbo (or let me make them!) and I'm in heaven ðŸ™‚

 Looking for a Song of the Day with "door" in its title, I found "La Porte d'en ArriÃ¨re (The Back Door)" by D. L. Menard in my collection on an album called "Jewels Of Cajun Music - Swamp Music, Vol. II". 

I deemed it pretty unlikely to find a video on YouTube, but to my surprise there were even two, one from a 1988 documentary "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AazJUQIEqNM" target="_blank">Aly Meets The Cajuns</a>", and the other one from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDlZMfDTNzQ&feature=related" target="_blank">Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival 2009</a>. I love both of them ðŸ˜„
