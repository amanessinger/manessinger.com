I don't know what the exact temperatures were, in any case they were beyond 30 degrees Celsius, and that's enough for me.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110709_174220_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110709_174220_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> After swimming for almost an hour (which did help, although not as much as one would believe), we went up into the mountains. There is a road that I didn't know, leading to an inn at 1960 meters. This finally did the trick ðŸ™‚

 Somehow the heat bogged me down and made me make a big number of completely irrelevant pictures. Here's two of them. The image of the Day was made on the way up, the other is a view from at around 1700 meters. The view is towards Villach.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/its_too_hot_for_words.html" target="_blank">It's Too Hot For Words</a>" by Billie Holiday. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gG23VOoPFY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
