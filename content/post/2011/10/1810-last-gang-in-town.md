That's the last post today, the image taken this afternoon on my way home from work.

 I had left a tad early, but then, I had taken the 5:26 morning train from Carinthia, and in the afternoon I was already pretty tired.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/clash/last_gang_in_town.html" target="_blank">Last Gang In Town</a>" from the 1978 Clash album "Give 'Em Enough Rope". Did I ever say I love British punk? Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ5o2Kodcqw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
