Not all is done yet, for instance the old apartment has no kitchen any more and the new one has no kitchen yet, but don't worry, we make progress ðŸ™‚

 It's warm again now and I was swimming. Monday's snow and the nights of frost have brought water temperatures down, but it's still bearable and if I can steal the time, I'm going again tomorrow.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kinks/do_it_again.html" target="_blank">Do It Again</a>" from the 1984 Kinks album "Word Of Mouth". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEw0ZYlpYXE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
