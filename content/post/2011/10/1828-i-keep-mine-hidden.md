And here we are: that's really an image made today. Well, almost. It's past midnight, thus it was yesterday technically.

 I'd have some more images, maybe I'll use them another day, but for now please excuse me, I'm tired ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/i_keep_mine_hidden.html" target="_blank">I Keep Mine Hidden</a>", the last recorded song by The Smiths, backside of the single "Girlfriend in a Coma". Hear either <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OEJCq_F_ic&feature=related" target="_blank">the original</a>, or see a much older but still fantastic Morrissey, performing 2009 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOOT9RM_FDg&feature=related" target="_blank">live in Manchester</a>, more or less his home town. I love it what happens when when artists sing at home ðŸ™‚
