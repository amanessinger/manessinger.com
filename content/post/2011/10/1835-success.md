In a comment congratulating to my blog's fifth birthday, <a href="http://jstrongphotos.com/VSBlog/" target="_blank">John</a> says
<blockquote>I’m into my second year for my blog – can’t say it’s been a tremendous success, but I’ve enjoyed posting.</blockquote>
and stopping and thinking I ask myself "Is my blog a success"???

Well, I have more than one blog. I have this photography blog, my much neglected programming blog, one where I announce releases of my open source project, and then some blogs that are retired and/or kept for technical reasons. Of course I can't put equal resources into all of them, even my day has only 24 hours, and because photography is so important to me, almost all runs into this photo blog.

The numbers speak a different language though. My programming blog with essentially <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/">one single post</a> out of eleven that matters, receives between 500 and 800 visits on weekdays, and even on weekend it gets about twice the visits of my photo blog, a blog with 1835 posts so far, administrative posts disregarded. This is true although I have not changed a thing in my <a href="http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/" target="_blank">Eclipse / GlassFish / Java EE 6 Cookbook</a> in more than a year. Cruel, huh?

 Well, this is another thing that I've learned: Success is a matter of personal definition. Numbers can't explain everything.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/iggy_pop/success.html" target="_blank">Success</a>" from Iggy Pop's 1977 album "Lust For Life". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGbw-cz35qo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
