I didn't even really try to make images on Sunday, so instead here's another image made late Friday afternoon. The sun had broken through in a low angle and it flooded the road to our old apartment in golden light. There was no traffic, I stopped the car in the middle of the road and got my picture.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/daniel_lanois/under_a_stormy_sky.html" target="_blank">Under A Stormy Sky</a>" from Daniel Lanois' 1989 landmark album "Acadie". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFCjds--pJI&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. You first heard it in "<a href="/2009/09/1070-under-stormy-sky.html" target="_blank">1070 â€“ Under A Stormy Sky</a>".
