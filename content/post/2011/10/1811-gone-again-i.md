Gone again? Summer? Well, not yet, this week we had summer so far, with temperatures in the mid to high twenties (Celsius I mean ðŸ˜„), and it's supposed to last until tomorrow, Thursday.

 But then, the signs are there, early leaves are falling. Here's a pattern I saw on Tuesday.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/gone_again.html" target="_blank">Gone Again</a>", title song of Patti Smith' 1996 album. Powerful music as always. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbrac5StbT4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
