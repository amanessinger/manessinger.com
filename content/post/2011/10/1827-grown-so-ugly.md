When it became clear that the Nazi were losing control of the air space above Germany and Austria, their heartland, they decided to build so-called "Flak Towers", named after the abbreviation of "FLiegerAbwehrKanone" (air-defense cannon).

Eight such pairs were built, three in Berlin, three in Vienna and two in Hamburg. They are ugly as hell, but they were constructed to withstand massive bombardment, thus it would be almost impossible to tear them down, and so they stand and remind us of Nazi barbarism.

 For illustrative purposes I've added three JPEGs fresh from the camera. Enjoyment would be the wrong word ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/captain_beefheart/grown_so_ugly.html" target="_blank">Grown So Ugly</a>" from the 1966 album "Safe As Milk" by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band. Well, the Captain always had a peculiar voice. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGbDYUoDn4Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
