Why could such an image be hard to process? Interestingly enough the original out of the camera was pretty good, it only lacked some punch. Normally this means that I open the RAW file, do to it what's needed, and then I'm done with it. Not so this time.

I don't have a profile for the LX5 in Adobe Camera RAW. Normally I don't care, I make my own colors anyway, but this time I wanted exactly the same as the JPEG, only with a tiny bit more ...

Guess what: I gave up and I worked on the JPEG ðŸ™‚
