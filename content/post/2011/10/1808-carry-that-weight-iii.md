As I said, our new home is not yet ready, the interior doors will be delivered on Thursday, some small details are not yet finished, but at least we have moved a ton of books this weekend. Literally. Roughly about 3000 books and maybe ten meters of folders, a lot of paper, packaged in about 180 paper bags. The lift is not yet functional either, this meant to carry the bags up to the second floor.

We got it in late afternoon and managed two transports, around 110 bags. I had hoped for a third delivery, but after #2 I was glad to call it quits.

 These images were taken with the new phone and then processed using "<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.dama.papercamera&hl=en" target="_blank">Paper Camera</a>", a funny little app from the Android market.
