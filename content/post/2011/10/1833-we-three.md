Somehow, in all that work in Carinthia, I forgot what I usually don't forget. I forgot my blog's birthday. It's a shame, especially because it was a proud fifth. Five years of continuous posting, one image per day, not always posted in time, but none was forgotten. Well, blog: Happy Birthday!!!

 It should have been something with five, but instead there were only three of those fallen leaves on the ground. We have rain in Vienna and this is supposed to continue for the next days.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/we_three.html" target="_blank">We Three</a>" from Patti Smith' 1978 album "Easter". Great album, and the 2009 live concert version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GL3geBbjw0" target="_blank">YouTube</a> is stellar as well. You could decide to skip it, but you would hate yourself for it, so you better just head over and hear it ðŸ˜„
