The most beautiful late summer in recent history, what fault could I find? It's Monday evening, I am in Vienna and I try to catch up. Here is an image made Friday afternoon, just after swimming.

 The lake is still warm, about 20 degrees Celsius, and it lies still now, when I'm swimming I mostly swim alone. That's paradise ðŸ™‚

It won't last though. Obviously it has to end, sure, but that it's supposed to end Friday/Saturday is unfortunate. Seems like I'm going to return to Carinthia just for the rain. But then, we'll see.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/daniel_lanois/still_water.html" target="_blank">Still Water</a>" from Daniel Lanois' 1989 masterpiece "Acadie", an album that's finally available again.
