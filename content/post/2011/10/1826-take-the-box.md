Monday afternoon I arrived back in Vienna and there I took this image. Much work is left in Villach and that will keep me busy for weekends to come, but in the meantime I have to work and earn some money ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/amy_winehouse/take_the_box.html" target="_blank">Take The Box</a>", is from late Amy Winehouse's 2003 album "Frank". I know you know it, but it does not hurt to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4oQuSLhDac" target="_blank">hear it anyway</a>. Much to the contrary.
