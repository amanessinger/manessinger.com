Have you ever used the expression "See you on the other side"? Sounds so cool, huh?

Well, we tried it today, but the guys helping us didn't show up. A little bit of a communication problem ðŸ™‚

This means another night in the old apartment, but I suppose it will be the last one. On the "other side" our books are not yet all sorted in, but we make progress.

Of course again I didn't find time to take images, much less to make one last attempt at swimming, What a pity, these are so beautiful days and gradually it's getting colder.

 Like yesterday the Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/melody_gardot/sweet_memory.html">Sweet Memory</a>" from Melody Gardot's 2008 album "Worrisome Heart".
