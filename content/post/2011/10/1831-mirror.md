It's very early Monday morning and I'm on my way to Vienna. I'll be an hour late to work, but when we finished working in the apartment yesterday, it was already too late for the train.

 Like the last weeks in Carinthia, photography did not happen at all. Here is an image for Saturday, again taken at the Czech monastery Kladruby, the processing this time inspired by <a href="http://blog.punctumsaliens.ch/" target="_blank">Roland</a>.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/mirror.html" target="_blank">Mirror</a>" from the 1996 Beautiful South album "Blue is the Colour". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6IjQN_oIy8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
