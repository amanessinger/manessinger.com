It's still Tuesday night, I'm trying to catch up, here is an image made on Saturday. It was still cold, we had still a little rain, but late in the afternoon, while I was running errands, the sun broke through and I was struck by the beauty of snow-covered Mittagskogel. Fortunately I knew a place where I could get a more or less unobstructed view.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_weller/foot_of_the_mountain.html" target="_blank">Foot Of The Mountain</a>" from Paul Weller's 1994 album "Live Wood". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l903eEhTh44" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
