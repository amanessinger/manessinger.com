Yesterday was Monday. I took a single image in the morning, this one, and then I went back to bed for half an hour more of sleep. When I woke up again it was drizzling, and although the day ended bright and sunny, I found no more time for photography.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgNGegfSGhk" target="_blank">Morninglight</a>" from Amanda Jenssen's 2010 album "Happyland". I have already used it two months ago in "<a href="/2011/08/1749-morninglight.html" target="_blank">1749 â€“ Morninglight</a>". Hear it on YouTube.
