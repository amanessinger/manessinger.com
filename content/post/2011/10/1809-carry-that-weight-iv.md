On Sunday we made two more transports, maybe 70 paper bags full of books, and then some boxes, an office chair and a garden chair, just to fill up the car. Again we had to carry everything up to the second floor. Hmm, you get used to it ðŸ˜„

Again it was made with the new phone and "<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.dama.papercamera&hl=en" target="_blank">Paper Camera</a>".
