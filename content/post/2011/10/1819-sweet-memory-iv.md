I didn't take images yesterday. Well, I did, some sky & cloud images after sundown, but I didn't have the time to even look at them. Italy a year ago will have to do it. This is Camogli, one photographer's dream on the Ligurian coast. Always a sweet memory ðŸ™‚

 Like in "<a target="_blank" href="/2011/07/1718-sweet-memory-iii.html">1718 â€“ Sweet Memory III</a>", the Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/melody_gardot/sweet_memory.html">Sweet Memory</a>" from Melody Gardot's 2008 album "Worrisome Heart". Always good music, YouTube has the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN2NmGF8MTg">live video</a>.
