It's Monday evening, I'm in Vienna again. I almost didn't take photographs at all, I simply had no time. Wednesday night I tried to catch up, using some images made on Saturday and some memories from Italy, and now I'm trying the same again. Sorry, believe me, my life is more irregular these days than my blog ðŸ˜„

 There is nothing remarkable in this sky, it's only the fact that I took the image from our roof terrace the first evening that we stayed in the new apartment. So this time it  really was "the other side", although so many things were unfinished yet.

The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/o/oasis/up_in_the_sky.html" target="_blank">Up In The Sky</a>" from the 1984 Oasis album "Definitely Maybe", appeared first on this blog in "<a href="/2007/09/336-split-decision-up-in-sky.html" target="_blank">336 â€“ Split Decision / Up In The Sky</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OQXEaVoAnw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
