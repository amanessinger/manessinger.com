By now everybody knows that Steve Jobs is dead. You know that I strongly disagreed with him, but nevertheless I feel deep respect for this great man. Only a genius like him could have created such a consistent collection of technical marvels, only a maniac like him could have had the power and the perseverance to do so, and his touch of authoritarianism must have been inevitable. A great work like his, a work that is so much defined by aesthetics and therefore by subjectivity can't be the result of a democratic process. Great works are done by single, great minds, and his was one of the greatest of our time.

Unfortunately he built a jail. It's the most beautiful jail ever built, but it is a jail nevertheless. That's why I have an Android phone, and if I ever buy a tablet (the iPad for my father does not count, OK?), it will be an Android. Any Android is better than sitting in a jail. Any but the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Color-Multi-touch-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=sr_tr_sr_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317918206&sr=8-1" target="_blank">Amazon Kindle Fire</a> that is. The Kindle Fire is based on Android, but it is a jail as well. Same jail, less beautiful.

Still, I admire Steve Jobs and I guess he must have had a fulfilled life, how ever short it was. May he rest in peace.

 The Song of the Day is the Otis Redding classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/o/otis_redding/just_one_more_day.html" target="_blank">Just One More Day</a>", interpreted by Huey Lewis And The News on their 2010 album "Soulsville". Hear it on <a href="http://vuighe.net/mp3/nghe-bai-hat-just-one-more-day_huey-lewis-and-the-news-1355805.html" target="_blank">vuighe.net</a>. 

Well, one day we all will wish for another day, just one more day, and then one day more, and for all of us there will be that day when our wish won't be granted.

And while we are talking about last days, this day was the last day of summer. Tomorrow temperatures are supposed to plummet by 15 degrees Celsius, along with thunderstorms, heavy rains and snowfall down to 700 meters.
