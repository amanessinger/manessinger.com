This is from the facade of a former Chinese restaurant near where I work. I's been closed for years and now the rooms are restored, but seemingly with the intention to put a shop in.

 The menu still hangs out, just as in happier times.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joe_bonamassa/happier_times.html">Happier Times</a>" from Joe Bonamassa's 2009 album "The Ballad Of John Henry". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVfMDCyv1Ro">YouTube</a>.
