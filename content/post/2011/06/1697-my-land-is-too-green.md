I like this image. It's my current wallpaper.

 It took it yesterday in a forest where I usually drive though when I go swimming. There are faster routes, but speed is highly overrated ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "My Land Is Too Green" by the great Mary Coughlan. I wanted to use this song for a long time (and maybe I have), but there was no video available until <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd2voOBE19Y">a few minutes ago</a>. Let's hope it stays online. Mary really deserves it.
