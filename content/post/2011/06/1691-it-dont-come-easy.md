This is an image of yesterday. Actually it's the image that I wanted to post before I had the bicycles.

At our lake we have some of those yellow water lilies, and I always wanted to photograph them. The problem is, the water is deep there, so deep that I can't stand, and I neither had a boat nor an air mattress available. What could I do?

I judged that I most likely could swim the maybe 15 meters with my feet alone, holding the camera and at least one hand out of the water, and that's what I did.


In the end it was very easy. I removed the electronic viewfinder (one expensive thing less to suffer when things go awry), mounted the polarizer, swam on my back to the lilies, and then tried my best to get some focused images with proper polarization and at least some composition. Not easy in bright sunlight, when you hardly see anything on the LCD and constantly move while trying not to drown ðŸ™‚

Seems like a good example of what you can do with the LX5 and probably wouldn't do with a DSLR. Or would you?

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/george_harrison/it_dont_come_easy.html">It Don't Come Easy</a>", one more song from Bettye LaVette's 2010 album "Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook".
