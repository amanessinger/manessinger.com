KGB, at least that's what I read on that wall. Taken this morning on my way to work. Hi <a target="_blank" href="http://markus-spring.info/wp/">Markus</a>, this is one for you ðŸ™‚

 The music is for you as well, although you'll have to hear it on a trip to Austria or basically anywhere outside of Germany, because unfortunately it is blocked in Germany like almost everything. But then, I suppose you know it anyway ðŸ™‚

"KGB (Kuhglockenblues)" or "Cow Bell Blues" is from Hubert von Goisern's 1995 album "Wia die Zeit vergeht - Live". I have uploaded this rather <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chRVSbS6bUw">uncommon piece of music</a> to YouTube. For those of you who don't know the artist, here are two of his better known works: "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETUR8_hp3Pg&feature=related">Hearst as nit</a>" and "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2fysmi5UW4&feature=related">Weit, weit weg</a>", both on the same album.

<strong>Update:</strong> OK, here's one more: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt8k6U_7u60">Bobby McFerrin &amp; Hubert von Goisern live in Vienna</a> ðŸ˜„

<strong>Up-update:</strong> and this may really be the last: "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Er-a1HZYJY">Afrika</a>"!
