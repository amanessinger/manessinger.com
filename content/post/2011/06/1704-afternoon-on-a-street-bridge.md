This is an archive image. Today is not a photography day, but today may become a cooking day. At least I was just shopping for that ðŸ™‚

 The view goes along JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe, a street that leads into Vienna's center from the west. I stand on a bridge where the Underground line U6 is not in the underground at all. It goes on brick arches in the middle of "GÃ¼rtel" (belt), the six lane outer ring around Vienna's inner districts. Traffic was easy and I like the patterns.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/simon_and_garfunkel/the_59th_street_bridge_song.html">The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)</a>" from Simon & Garfunkel's 1966 album "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary And Thyme".
