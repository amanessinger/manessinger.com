So, over on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bungalow104.com/">April's blog</a>, Flo considers me a "contemplative photographer". Really, I've no idea what they're talking about, they discuss a book that I've not read, but when I just try to understand what it could mean, I arrive at something like this picture. Contemplative enough?

 This should have been an image of Wednesday, but although I have some, there is nothing that inspires me. This one is from today (actually yesterday already). We had rain in the morning and several times during the day.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/devil_doll/it_was_raining.html">It Was Raining</a>" from the 2003 Devil Doll album "Queen of Pain". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqr10ab2Jjo">YouTube</a>.
