Well, being a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bungalow104.com/">contemplative photographer</a> does not mean to stop being <a target="_blank" href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/journal/2010/8/25/civilized-ku-647-ball-o-bikes.html">The Bike Photographer</a> ðŸ™‚

 That's it for tonight, three posts and we're back to synchronicity.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/shakira/eyes_like_yours_ojos_asi.html">Eyes Like Yours</a>" from Shakira's 2001 album "Laundry Service". I like the music (hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g6oAnKOaEs&feature=related">YouTube</a>), so I bought it twice, the second time as digital download, when it was discounted at Amazon. 

Why didn't I just rip my CD? Well, I couldn't. It was one of that "copy-protected" non-CDs that Sony graced the earth with at that time. I couldn't play it on the PC (expected), I couldn't play it in the car (common) and I couldn't play it on my Sony portable CD player (WTF???). You may be inclined to feel compassion for Sony, given how they are under attack these days. Honestly, don't, they deserve it!
