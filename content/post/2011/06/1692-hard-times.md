This shop had good times, then it had hard times and now it is gone. Certainly there are stories to be written, stories of a patron and his customers, stories of a street, stories of an era, but that's not my job and not my ambition and certainly not my gift. I am no Steinbeck, I am a photographer, and when I don't take photographs, I am a programmer.

 Apropos programming: Today I have released version 1.2.1 of my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.azzyzt.org/">Azzyzt JEE Tools</a>, and with that release I have the impression that we're past all major problems. If you are a programmer (hmm ... most photographers today are ðŸ™‚), if you need to implement database-backed web services, if you happen to like Java, and if you haven't tried it yet, I guess now is a good time. Might save you a lot of work.

And ... did I mention it's free?

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ray_charles/hard_times.html">Hard Times</a>" is a Ray Charles classic, today interpreted by Eric Clapton on his 1991 live album "24 Nights". The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGCxo2HLuYA">version on YouTube</a> is different, but not much, and David Sanborn is a good match. Still, you may prefer Ray Charles and I certainly do. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFaUmhgJtBU&feature=related">Here is his version</a>.
