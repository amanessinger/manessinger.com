Some time ago, when I had complained about the many times that I had sat on the train, with the most wonderful landscape in the most enticing light outside, Flo asked me why I don't simply take images from the train.

Well, I can't remember what I answered, probably something stupid about reflections and dirty windows or who knows what. Fact is, that's exactly what I did today.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110627_072004_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110627_072004_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I missed my train yesterday, and therefore I left Villach in the early morning. The taxi came at 5 am, the train left at 5:26 am, and at 9:50 I was already in Vienna behind my desk.

Of course most of them are rubbish. You don't have much control over the framing, because in order to avoid reflections, you have to hold the camera flat to the glass, but still, there are some that I like.

I suppose there'll be more of that ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is The Van Morrison song "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/fast_train.html">Fast Train</a>", sung by Solomon Burke on his 2002 album "Don't Give Up on Me". I've already used the song in "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/07/273-movin-on-fast-train.html">273 - Movin' on a Fast Train</a>". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcj0cK5O-fk&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
