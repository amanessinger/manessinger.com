It's good to have the question of the LX5's colors out of the way. Time to get back photographing ðŸ™‚

Here's one image made late yesterday afternoon. I was on my way to the lake and made my usual detour. It's amazing how fast clouds move. I tried a few shots during maybe two or three minutes, in the first I liked how the clouds echoed the shadows, but the framing was wrong. When I got the framing right, the clouds had moved. I was already willing to give up and accept a lesser sky, when suddenly everything came together.

  The image was taken with only a split-ND filter attached, and later in Photoshop I have increased foreground contrast. This also increased foreground saturation, and to compensate for the color shift, I have added a touch of magenta to the yellows. That's all ðŸ™‚
