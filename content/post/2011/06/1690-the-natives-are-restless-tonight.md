I really wanted to post another Saturday image, but when I went out around midnight and passed this bike shop, I found the lively scene inside quite inspiring.

 I'm not sure if this was the best frame to be had (tough I tried some) nor am I sure if this is the best processing. I may come back ðŸ™‚

"The Natives Are Restless Tonight" is from Horace Silver's 1965 album "Song for My Father". Great Jazz. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abpm6brSE74">YouTube</a>.
