Hmmm ... I would have had other images, better images perhaps, but somehow I like this one. Don't know why, maybe it's this surreal single letter "B". 

Remember <a target="_blank" href="/2011/06/1704-afternoon-on-a-street-bridge.html">yesterday's image</a>? There was a pickup with the letters "STRABAG" on it. Well, "STRABAG" is one of the biggest construction companies in Europe, and they are building this new Cash & Carry market as well. The "B" in this image is on a container, and obviously those containers are meant to be combined to make up the company's name. This being only a small construction site, part of the name ("AB", but I've omitted the "A") has to suffice ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/just_trying_to_be.html">Just Trying To Be</a>" from the 1972 Jethro Tull album "Living in the Past". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMq2lAloMIE">YouTube</a>.
