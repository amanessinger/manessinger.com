It's not only a problem of grass color, really. Are you satisfied with the JPEGs from your camera? Do you feel the colors are as good as they can possibly be?

I don't know what your experiences are, but mine are largely negative. Colors on the D200 were frequently too greenish, the D300 goes a tad too far the other way, and the LX5's colors are far from natural. That's the reason why I don't like to shoot JPEG. Using RAW, I really don't care which camera produced the RAW file, I can create the result that I want.

What is it that I want? Yesterday I wanted the colors to look convincingly natural. In other cases I accept a certain degree of artificiality, as long as it is not obviously wrong.

I took it at about noon, and on a bright, sunny summer day this means lots and lots of contrast, flat colors, burnt out skies and all sorts of nasty surprises. Global color temperature does not help here, you really must change the color balance for certain colors, push saturation for some colors and strictly control it for others. I'm pretty satisfied with the result, it is much more artificial than yesterday's image, but it is so in a pleasing way.

At almost 8 pm I set out to make some sunset images. There is a place overlooking Villach, and I figured that, facing north-west, it would be ideal at this time of the year.

The result is a 25 megapixel stitched panorama. Click on the thumbnail, it links to the full size image. Pretty impressive, what you can make with a pocket sized camera like the LX5, huh? Sure, there is some noise, but then, I have sharpened the image to reveal brutal detail. It's not a great image, but in a way it still impresses me and I wanted to share it with you.

 The Image of the Day is a more traditional sunset image, exposed for the sunny fringes of the clouds, thus underexposed, and although this looks extremely different from what you see when you're there, the funny thing is, this is the kind of photos that are perfectly accepted by "photography purists". Crazy, huh?

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/norah_jones/the_long_day_is_over.html">The Long Day Is Over</a>" from Norah Jones' 2002 album "Come Away With Me". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oow_ZVCAWxo">YouTube</a>.
