It's Friday afternoon, I'm on the train and here's a pinwheel that I saw Wednesday afternoon on my way home from work.


Weather was definitely less sunny than this guy want's to make you think, but in a week of catastrophic tornadoes, who am I to complain about the weather?

Now that I think of it, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/incredible_string_band/swift_as_the_wind.html">Swift As The Wind</a>", again by The Incredible String Band, this time from their album "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter", could come across as tasteless as well, I hope you know it isn't meant that way.
