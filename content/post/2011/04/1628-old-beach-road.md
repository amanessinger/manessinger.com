We've spent a day in Croatia yesterday, in Krk, where <a target="_blank" href="http://markus-spring.info/wp/">Markus Spring</a> likes to be for his summer holidays. Hi Markus!

Nowadays <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.at/maps?hl=en&safe=off&qscrl=1&q=krk,+croatia&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=Krk,+Croatia&gl=at&ei=K2SYTbXCNYbvsgb0o42zCA&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA">Krk</a> is only three hours away from Villach, thus it's definitely an option to drive down for an afternoon on the beach. Having stood in the water up to my knees, I can tell you that swimming would have been an option. The water had around 15 centigrades, but that's not colder than when I stop swimming in October. Well, I was not prepared but I'll definitely bring trunks and towels next time ðŸ™‚


"Old Beach Road" is a 1989 single from Australian band <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha's_Vineyard_(band)">Martha's Vineyard</a>'s self-titled debut album. They broke up after the album, in some markets a second album was released with what material was left, thus it rather surprised me to see, that you still can get the CD.

Anyway, I like the album and if you look at the original video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jbNtT3veeQ">YouTube</a>, I guess you'll understand why. Enjoy!
