I'm slightly behind schedule, so please forgive me for making this short. This is the post for Tuesday, featuring an image actually made yesterday.

 The Song of the Day is "The Ballad of the Fallen" from the 1983 second Liberation Music Orchestra album "The Ballad of the Fallen", featuring Charlie Haden, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Sharon Freeman, Mick Goodrick, Jack Jeffers, Micheal Mantler, Paul Motian, Jim Pepper, Dewey Redman, Steve Slagle and Gary Valente. 

It is available as digital download, and if I had to suggest one single album for you to buy, one and only one, it would always be this. Incredible music. It was not available on YouTube, thus <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRe1QY6eAzY">I have uploaded it</a>. It's blocked in Germany, thankfully nowhere else ðŸ™‚
