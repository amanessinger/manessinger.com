Today I walked though some parts of Villach that were completely unknown to me. Do you know that phenomenon? We all constantly crave for remote destinations, but we don't know the very places where we live.

 I made this image of my own shadow when I experimented with the LX5's manual focus. I made some images with minimum focus and that's one of them. 

The Song of the Day is "Where Do You Go" from Lhasa De Sela's 2009 album "Lhasa". She was only able to make three records before she passed away, but all three are great and would be memorable even without the tragic story. Hear the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gJZtv9rLTc">YouTube</a>.
