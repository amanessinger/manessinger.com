Sorry for the delay, it was quite a stressful week. Easter Monday is traditionally free in Catholic Austria, thus my working week began Monday morning.


Of the few images that I made, this cooperative effort of a bicycle and a piece of Graffiti was doubtlessly the best, and it is also a good example for an image that cries out for it's Song of the Day ðŸ™‚

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/incredible_string_band/the_circle_is_unbroken.html">The Circle Is Unbroken</a>" is from the 1968 Incredible String Band album "The Big Huge". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgkxSSQbGsI">YouTube</a>.
