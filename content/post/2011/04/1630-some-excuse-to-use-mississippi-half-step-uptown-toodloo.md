Here's some geometry form the Underground, but in reality it is nothing but an excuse to use a song that I otherwise wouldn't possibly ever have been able to use. 

 Really: can you imagine an image that cries to be called "Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodeloo"???

I always wanted to use that song. It's from "Wake Of The Flood", the 1973 studio album of The Grateful Dead. You either have it or you need it. There's no way around ðŸ˜„

Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac2l8DeK8LM">YouTube</a>.
