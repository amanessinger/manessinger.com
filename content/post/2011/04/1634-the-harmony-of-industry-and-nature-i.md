When I took this image yesterday, I already did it with the intention of adding it to my "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/04/904-harmony-of-industry-and-nature.html">The Harmony</a> <a target="_blank" href="/2009/10/1107-the-harmony-of-industry-and-nature-ii.html">Of Industry</a> <a target="_blank" href="/2010/11/1484-the-harmony-of-industry-and-nature-iii.html">And Nature</a>" series. I was not sure if it's good enough for that, but the more I look at it, the more I like it. It's so ... falsely positive ðŸ˜„

 With the Song of the Day we go back to the 2008 Nine Inch Nails album "Ghosts I-IV". The Song of the Day, "34 Ghosts IV", is a sinister gem that nicely contrasts the image. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG4I8FovIAU">YouTube</a> or download the whole 36 tracks album for $5. Be warned though, many of you will consider much of it industrial noise ðŸ˜›
