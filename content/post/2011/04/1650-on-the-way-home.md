Here's one image of today. This whole Easter weekend was mostly warm and sunny, even though the forecast had predicted the opposite.


The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/buffalo_springfield/on_the_way_home.html">On The Way Home</a>", the opener of the 1968 last Buffalo Springfield album "Last Time Around". 

 Actually I don't have it in the Buffalo Springfield version (yet), but instead on the CSN&Y live album "4 Way Street". Compare them for yourself: Here's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBQ2HbowaZo">Buffalo Springfield</a> and that's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA00VNhlnHQ">CSN&Y</a>. Hmm ... hard to tell, but I definitely wouldn't dismiss Buffalo Springfield ðŸ™‚
