At the moment my keeper rate is embarrassingly low, but I have not yet found a way to blame it on the camera ðŸ™‚

 Today's image is from my Sunday afternoon walk through the forest near the river.

When I recently was directed at "<a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/etta_james/a_sunday_kind_of_love.html">A Sunday Kind Of Love</a>" by Etta James, I fell in love myself and I immediately bought her 1961 debut album "At Last!".
