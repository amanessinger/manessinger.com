OK, I admit, this title is a little far-fetched. I took the image yesterday while waiting for the Underground. It's on some emergency switch or, in German, "Notschalter". 

 The Song of the Day, and this connection is even farther fetched, is "Forget Me Nots" from Randy Crawford's 1995 album "Naked & True". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aeVVlpg7mQ">YouTube</a>.
