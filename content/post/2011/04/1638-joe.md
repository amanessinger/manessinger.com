It's Friday afternoon and I am on the train to Carinthia again. This was a busy week, thus we are a tad late. This is an image taken Wednesday morning.

 The Song of the Day is, of course, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_zappa/joes_garage.html">Joe's Garage</a>" from Frank Zappa's 1979 rock opera of the same name. YouTube has several versions, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Afa0F-UBo">this one</a> comes with the long "Central Scrutinizer" intro. I love the moment when the song really begins ðŸ™‚
