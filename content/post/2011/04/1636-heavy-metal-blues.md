I'm on the train back to Vienna. It was really warm today, bright and sunny, but I spent only about half an hour walking through Villach and taking photographs. 


This is the only image that speaks to me: a fence, bright sunlight reflected, shallow DOF.

The Song of the Day is "Heavy Metal Blues" from "The Bleeding Edge" by The Revelations featuring Tre Williams. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq5dgYscPgY">video</a>.
