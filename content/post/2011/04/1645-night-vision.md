This is ISO 400, and that's how high it gets at night. My version of this image retains some detail in parts of the image and, compared to Panasonic's JPEG, gives up some in others. It's not a draw, but it's close. 

 On the other hand, I rarely need anything higher than ISO 400. This is f2 at 1/4s, hand-held. Due to the small sensor, there is DOF galore, even wide open at f2.

Today will be an exception, I need to make a portrait, and thus I will be back to the D300 and the 85/1.4. Let's see how that feels ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/suzanne_vega/night_vision.html">Night Vision</a>" from Suzanne Vega's 1987 album "Solitude Standing". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zETMiioinxE">YouTube</a>.
