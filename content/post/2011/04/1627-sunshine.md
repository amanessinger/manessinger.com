Time is scarce, but there is always the option to relax a few minutes and enjoy the sunshine, even in places like a stairway leading down to the underground.

 The Song of the Day, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nazareth/sunshine.html">Sunshine</a>", is of course from the 1975 Nazareth album "Rampant", one of those albums of the seventies that featured a kind of cover art completely lost to our time. 

 The album is not available for download in the US (here it is), but if you don't mind compilations, there is a good one available. 

Hear the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OntVeUr5NLI&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
