It's still the same night, it's only getting later, and yes, I know that I said I Can't process a single image today. But then, a whole day without processing a single image?? Yikes!!!!

 This is just a completely ordinary April, just as it's supposed to be, at least on the northern hemisphere, that is.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ron_sexsmith/april_after_all.html">April After All</a>" by Anne Sofie von Otter, taken from her collaboration album with Elvis Costello, "For The Stars". I've just uploaded a video to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMK0-JQ-aFc">YouTube</a> and currently it's only blocked in Germany, but then, what's not blocked in Germany?
