Here are two more images and then we are done for today. I've taken both of them in the morning.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110407_075207_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110407_075207_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, the blossoms, it's not much of an image, but somehow walking through Vienna on a sunny Spring morning really makes me happy. Flowers and blossoms DO lift the mood ðŸ™‚ 

Btw, I am on the train to Carinthia, one day earlier because I have a busy day there tomorrow, but that's not the point. The point is, that I have left my D300 in Vienna. Hey, that's the first time in years. It's not that I don't miss it at times, but I think I'll use the LX5 exclusively for a week or two longer, and then I'll switch back and see how it feels.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/blondie/im_always_touched_by_your_presence_dear.html">(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear</a>", originally from Blondie's 1978 "Plastic Letters" album. I always loved their music, and when you see the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg0D9iB6vUE">YouTube</a>, you just have to ignore the hairdo and all is fine ðŸ™‚
