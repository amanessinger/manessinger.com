I'm still on the train and this is finally an image of today. I just played around with colors, and the result somehow reminds me of a flag. Weird association? Maybe, but it makes today a Flag Day ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/housemartins/flag_day.html">Flag Day</a>", is from the 1986 Housemartins album "London 0 Hull 4". You remember, The Housemartins were the band featuring Paul Heaton and Norman Cook, the guy who later became Fatboy Slim. Paul Heaton successfully went on with The Beautiful South, and since they finally split, he records and tours under his own name again.
