An image taken yesterday morning. Apart from that I would have had one single sundown image, nothing more. I spare us the sundown. Oh, by the way, this is a bike shop ðŸ™‚


"Red, White & Blues" is a song from the album of the same name by Mighty Mo Rodgers. I couldn't find it on YouTube, so I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akAuvNasd2M">uploaded it myself</a>. Great album, unfortunately not available as downloads.
