The Tokina 11-16/2.8? Easily one of my most under-utilized lenses. It's fine for interiors and low light, especially when you neither want to go ultra-wide (ultra like in Sigma 8-16) nor need a big zoom range. DxO supports it.

 This is a DxO conversion again. By accident I had used f4 and wasted a perfectly good stop, thus the image is at ISO 900 and more noisy than would have been necessary. I like DxO's trademark fine noise though.

The Song of the Day is "Search For Life" from Ornette Coleman's 1995 album "Tone Dialing". Ornette Coleman. Not everybody's taste for sure, but definitely mine ðŸ˜„
