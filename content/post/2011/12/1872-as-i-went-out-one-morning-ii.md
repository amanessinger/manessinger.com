DxO has a new version, <a href="http://www.dxo.com/us/photo/dxo_optics_pro/introduction" target="_blank">DxO Optics Pro 7</a>, the RAW format of my LX5 is natively supported and so is the lens, and because I have not looked into it since 4.5, I thought, heck, let's go for some <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2011/12/kirks-take-kirk-tuck-2.html" target="_blank">Activity</a> for a change ðŸ™‚

It won't be any kind of formal test, it won't be called a "review" even by my low standards, it's just that I try it, convert images not only with ACR/Photoshop but also with DxO, compare the results with the JPEG that I got from the camera, and in a few posts I guess I'll be ready for a conclusion. 

I started Thursday with the Bicycle and the lock (where I took the Photoshop version), and this is an image taken early Friday morning, while it was foggy and dark. A reflection in a window, almost no light, the light that was there being the worst type of orange street light, the camera at ISO 800, certainly a worst case. Panasonic's JPEG engine won before my own Photoshop conversion, with DxO coming out last. Neither version was really usable, in the end I still used the DxO version with some extremely graphic B&W effect added in <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/adjust/" target="_blank">Topaz Adjust 5</a>.

  It begins to get really hard to find songs that I have not used before and that also make sense as an image title. I already used Bob Dylan's "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/as_i_went_out_one_morning.html" target="_blank">As I Went Out One Morning</a>" in "<a href="/2008/05/572-as-i-went-out-one-morning.html" target="_blank">572 â€“ As I Went Out One Morning</a>", here it is again. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuQsSKzK9x0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
