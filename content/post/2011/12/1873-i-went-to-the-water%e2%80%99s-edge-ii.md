This image was actually taken on Sunday afternoon. I made not a single image on Saturday. 

Did I say it's hard to come up with new songs? Boy, it definitely is 🙂

 I've already used "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cyndi_lauper/waters_edge.html" target="_blank">Water's Edge</a>" from Cyndi Lauper's 2005 album “The Body Acoustic” in "<a href="/2008/12/800-i-went-to-waters-edge.html" target="_blank">800 – I Went To The Water’s Edge</a>" and funnily enough this image was taken in exactly the same place 🙂

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XguWLbf1PDA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
