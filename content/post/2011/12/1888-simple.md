A few weeks ago <a href="http://blog.punctumsaliens.ch/" target="_blank">Roland</a> reminded me how important it is to simplify. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111218_142150_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111218_142150_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Here is a good example. I saw the hill with the tree and the mountain in the background. Having only the 17mm prime with me, I thought I need to use something in the foreground, and so I framed them between two snow poles. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111218_150522_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111218_150522_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In a way I like the image, but it really suffers from the fact that the tree and the mountain are not perfectly aligned. For the Image of the Day I got rid of the poles and took some steps to the left. Suddenly everything is simple, and that there is some repetition between the pattern of the snow and the clouds in the sky doesn't hurt either. I really love this image.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111218_144740_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111218_144740_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's funny, I had bought the 17/2.8 because it was part of the deal. What I really was after was a PEN camera and the electronic viewfinder. Now that I have it though, I find it to be an extremely versatile lens.

Micro Four Thirds has a crop factor of 2, thus the focal length is equivalent to 34 mm, a moderate wide angle lens, and because it is not an extreme focal length, you don't get extreme perspective distortions either, and it is easy enough to zoom with your feet. 

 In fact it's that same prime lens phenomenon over again: restricting myself to a single focal length fuels my creativity. It's no restriction at all. Just to the contrary.

The Song of the Day is "Simple" from k.d.Lang's beautiful 2000 album "Invincible Summer". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqGZlBnb_Qc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
