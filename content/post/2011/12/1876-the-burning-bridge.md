I didn't take any usable images on Tuesday, so here's a Wednesday morning image instead. I tried it in DxO Optics Pro and finally settled with Adobe Camera RAW / Topaz Denoise / Photoshop. 

 It's a slight improvement over the camera's JPEG (not much, really), but it was much better than what I could get out of DxO, even after some experiments.

It's interesting: I've spent much time with DxO now, and although I get excellent results with images taken with the D200 or the D300 (comparable to the best I can do in Photoshop), it's almost always worse than the JPEG for the LX5, regardless of ISO.

The Song of the Day is "Burning Bridge" from Kate Bush's 1985 album "Hounds of Love". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsJrJc3X3b4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
