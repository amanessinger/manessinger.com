Well, and this is the accessory that I bought: a Novoflex Adapter MFT/NIK.  

I have quite a number of Nikon lenses and I really can imagine good use for some of them on a Micro Four Thirds camera. A 50/1.2 suddenly becomes a portrait lens, an 85/1.4 becomes an ideal concert lens, or just take the image of the Day: I took it from our roof terrace in Villach. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111217_142507_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111217_142507_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The lens? Sigma 150/2.8, and on the PEN this lens becomes a very fast 300 mm lens!

 Of course all Nikon lenses become manual focus lenses, but that's not really a problem. Focusing on a PEN is extremely convenient and accurate, in fact more so than on the D300. 

You just switch the display into a mode where the focus area is displayed, and then you use OK to toggle between a magnified view and the normal view. Focusing in the magnified view is much easier than in a DSLR's viewfinder.

It solves a problem though. Modern Nikon lenses don't have an aperture ring any more. Aperture is controlled with a wheel on the camera, but when you don't have a Nikon camera, the lens is always fully stopped down. In order to fix that, the Novoflex adapter has an aperture ring that allows aperture control on all Nikon lenses.

For modern G lenses you can use the ring to control the whole aperture range, and for old lenses with aperture ring, the ring controls aperture between wide open and the aperture set on the lens. Thus if I set the 50/1.2 AI-S to f8, then I can control the aperture between f1.2 and f8 via the adapter. 

 The other two images were taken with the Olympus 17/2.8.
