It's very early Tuesday morning. After a long weekend I am finally on the train to Vienna again. I really need to flush the pipeline, so please allow me to post a quick succession of images, three from Thursday, the only sunny day this weekend. Here's the first one.

As to the title, this and all of the following four posts will be titled "Searching", because I am still searching my way around in and trying to work with <a href="http://www.dxo.com/us/photo/dxo_optics_pro/introduction" target="_blank">DxO Optics Pro 7</a>, an occupation that really ate all of my time that I would normally have spent posting ðŸ˜„ 

This image, taken with the D300 and the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC, has been processed with both Adobe Camera RAW and DxO, and although I probably would have been able to get a very similar result with ACR and Photoshop, DxO was clearly the winner. The lens is supported, its distortions are perfectly corrected, and what I really liked is the ease with which I was able to preserve the highlights, get excellent shadow detail and still have punchy mid-tones. Again: I could probably have managed to get there in Photoshop, but only with much more effort, and at least what I created in a first take (and probably would have settled with normally) looked worse.

 This again shows that DxO is a good choice for DSLR images. Probably its effectiveness is greater than with LX5 RAW files, because it has much more dynamic range to work with, probably its algorithms are tuned to work best with wide dynamic range.
