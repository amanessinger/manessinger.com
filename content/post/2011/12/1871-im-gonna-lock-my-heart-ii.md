Pretty insane: my last post was for Wednesday. Well, here we are with an image genuinely taken on Thursday.

 Please bear with me, I have images ready, I only did not find the time to post them.

Like in "<a href="/2010/03/1237-im-gonna-lock-my-heart.html" target="_blank">1237 – I’m Gonna Lock My Heart</a>" the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/im_gonna_lock_my_heart_and_throw_away_the_key.html" target="_blank">I'm Gonna Lock My Heart (And Throw Away The Key)</a>" by Billie Holiday. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOv1pjl_UC8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
