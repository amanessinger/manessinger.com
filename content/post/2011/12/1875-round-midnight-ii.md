It's not that I'm seeking out things that are hard to capture, but this was another one of those images under orange street light. I took it Sunday night when I arrived in Vienna, but technically it was already Monday. It's ISO 800 at -1 EV, I'm definitely pushing the limit here.

Finally a win for DxO over the LX5's JPEG engine, but then, Photoshop again earned the crown. You see a system here? Either I am completely incapable of understanding the greatness that is DxO Optics Pro, or it simply is not such a great RAW converter for the LX5. 

 But then, just let me play some more time, the trial version is still good for 27 days, I may learn how to master it.

The Song of the Day is "‘Round Midnight", but not by Thelonious Monk himself like in "<a href="/2010/01/1184-round-midnight.html" target="_blank">1184 – ‘Round Midnight</a>", no, today it's Cassandra Wilson. See her on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4pHz1Xg2A&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
