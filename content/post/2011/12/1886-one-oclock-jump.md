And here is it, my latest acquisition: an Olympus PEN E-P2 Special Edition. That's the one with the black 17/2.8 pancake lens and the electronic viewfinder.

 I bought it via eBay. The seller, a professional art photographer, had used it once on a wedding, only to find out that this is not an action camera. Well, that's right, but otherwise ... it's a gorgeous camera ðŸ™‚

 I took this image Friday noon. I had taken an hour off to buy an important accessory. More about that in the next post.

The Song of the Day is "One O'Clock Jump". I have it on the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross album "Sing A Song Of Basie", but the Lambert, Hendricks & Bavan version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMoMY2MTpmY" target="_blank">YouTube</a> is great as well.
