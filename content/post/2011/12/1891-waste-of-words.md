Some years ago the two dominant gutter press newspapers in Austria discovered that giving away shortened editions for free actually generated revenue from advertising, and that it overall extended their reach to people who otherwise wouldn't have bought newspapers at all. That in turn made them interesting for political parties, and the result is a very unhealthy mix of interests.

 Of course a side effect of those papers being (a) for free and (b) distributed in Underground stations is, that they are frequently thrown away as soon as people leave the Underground. Here's how that looked on Wednesday afternoon.

The Song of the Day is "Waste Of Words" (well, with those papers probably more a waste of pictures) from the 2005 De-Phazz album "Natural Fake". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qQZeZbLuFM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
