As I mentioned in the last post, you can't expect to use the Olympus PEN and one of these manual focus lenses to make images of your children or pets.

But then, today I was lucky. Here are two images of our cat Tonto. In all the years of Tontography I did not manage to record a yawn like this. Tokina 11-16/2.8.

The Image of the Day was taken a while later (Yikes, I see from the timestamp that the Olympus is still on daylight saving time!!), shortly before sundown (rather before our gloomy daylight vanished). 

 It's already been taken with the Olympus 17/2.8. As I write this, I am back in Vienna and I have not taken the 11-16/2.8 with me. I had planned to use it for the whole week, but after my experiences of the weekend, I'll use the autofocus pancake prime again. You see, I'm still wondering what this camera means to me ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/no_way_pedro.html" target="_blank">No Way Pedro</a>" by Van Morrison and Linda Gail Lewis, taken from their 2000 album "You Win Again".
