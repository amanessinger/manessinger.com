There's something magic in sunny winter mornings. Well, of course it's not real winter here. No snow. But then, the light is winter light. The direction of the light at this time of the day is a winter direction. 

 Things look different in winter because, because ... they are.

The Song of the Day is “<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/something_magic.html" target="_blank">Something Magic</a>” by Procol Harum. Hear the version from the 2009 live album “In Concert with The Danish National Concert Orchestra and Choir” on YouTube. We already had this song in "<a href="/2010/04/1266-something-magic.html" target="_blank">1266 – Something Magic</a>" but today I'm reckless 😄
