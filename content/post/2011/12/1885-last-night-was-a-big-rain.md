Hmm ... not posting for almost a week and then doing all in a day, it's a bad habit but I can't help it. 

 Actually it was not last night, it was last Thursday night. I was on my way to meet the seller of my latest acquisition. Night, rain, traffic lights, it's paradise ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Last Night Was A Big Rain" from Sara Hickman's 1989 album "Equal Scary People". Scary is also the fashion in her 1990 live performance <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1A20PTPRvo" target="_blank">video</a>. Still, I like it ðŸ™‚
