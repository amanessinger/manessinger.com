After the posting spree early in the morning, I laid down and slept for the rest of the ride. When I woke up and the train was already rolling into Vienna, I was greeted by a bright, sunny day.

 It's hard to explain how this feels. The last few days were gloomy, rainy and depressing. I had not read a weather forecast and I didn't expect anything but another drab day. Then I opened my eyes and it was like, like ... an explosion of light!!!

This should really have been part of my "<a href="/2011/06/1712-fast-train.html" target="_blank">Fast</a> <a href="/2011/07/1719-fast-train-ii.html" target="_blank">Train</a>" series, but I couldn't resist the lure of Jacques Brel's "J'Arrive". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgV3jlNQ3Bw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
