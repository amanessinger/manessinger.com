I'm not sure if I tried this image in DxO as well, I suppose, but in the end it was Photoshop that made it. This is the D300 again, and while I like DxO for its ability to handle difficult tonal situations, I find it much easier to arrive at satisfying colors with Photoshop.

 Just for the record: All of the images that I process in DxO get a finish in Photoshop, and in almost all cases it is color that I enhance. Thus, what I am considering is buying DxO as an alternative RAW converter, not as a replacement for Photoshop.

The Song of the Day (and the Day would have been Friday, although this is a Thursday image again) is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/in_search_of_peter_pan.html" target="_blank">In Search of Peter Pan</a>" from Kate Bush's 1978 album "Lionheart". Enjoy it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hNzUl274w0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
