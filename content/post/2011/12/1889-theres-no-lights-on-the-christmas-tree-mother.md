Oh, it's that wonderful time of the year again. Shopping gets painful and collecting a parcel at the post office must be considered suicidal. Both I did yesterday ðŸ™‚

 And when suddenly the lights go out, well, maybe they're burning Big Louie tonight! The Song of the Day is the wonderful "There's No Lights On The Christmas Tree Mother" from the Sensational Alex Harvey Band's 1972 debut album "Framed". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_gsEaQVbSg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
