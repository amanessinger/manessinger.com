The rather mediocre image of the last post was even a heavy crop to get at least a resemblance of a composition. No, Sunday was not my most inspired day. I drove around, made some lake images and soon realized that I was just not in the mood.

 In the end this is what I saw from our terrace. I liked the multi-layered sky, took a few images, and this is probably the best of them. Well, a sundown. But then, it just was not my day ðŸ˜„

"<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jam/burning_sky.html" target="_blank">Burning Sky</a>" is from the 1979 Jam album "Setting Sons". Hooray, unlike all other songs with the word "sky" in the title, I have not used this song before ðŸ™‚

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS_qw33mR00" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Oh and, btw, DxO had a hard time with this image, Photoshop was it in the end.
