Weekends!! Yesterday I was ridiculed for having related what I'd heard in the weather forecast from Wednesday. For the weekend they had reported snowfalls down to 500 meters. Villach is at pretty exactly 500 meters, and yesterday morning, with a clear blue sky outside and temperatures much too warm for the season, I felt pretty sheepish. 



Well, you know how it went on, and finally today we had slight snowfall. It didn't exactly animate me to go out, and instead I decided to look at some of my unprocessed past images again. Here's one of them, a bike in front of a "Biker's Inn" in Villach.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/louis_armstrong/dont_get_around_much_anymore.html">Don't Get Around Much Anymore</a>" from the Louis Armstrong / Duke Ellington collaboration "The Great Summit". The record was recommended to me by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.butzi.net/">Paul Butzi</a>, inventor of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sofobomo.org/">SoFoBoMo</a>, a deep thinker and lover of good music. May he blog again!

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxwvOncHVbQ">YouTube</a> has the song. Enjoy.
