When we returned from Slovenia yesterday, we took the mountain road via Passo di Predil back to Tarvisio. When we passed the small mountain lake <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lago_del_Predil">Lago del Predil</a>, it was already dark, but I recognized the ice on the lake.

 Today I figured out what would be a good time to return, decided for 1 pm, and here's the result.

This is one of the about 20 bracketed series that I took, the only one that I have processed so far. It's a manual blend of three exposures, spiced up with three different versions from Topaz Adjust and plenty of other layers. 

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madonna/frozen.html">Frozen</a>" from Madonna's 1998 "Ray Of Light" album. See a video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXFHf8xZ1CA">YouTube</a>. That's a line I've always loved: "You're frozen when your heart's not open". True ðŸ™‚
