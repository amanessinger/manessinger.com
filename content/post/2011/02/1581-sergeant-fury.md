 It's Friday afternoon, it's raining outside, I'm on the train to Carinthia, and this is an image taken this morning.

I had to leave work early today. Normally I go to the train directly from work, but today I had to go back home. The new 2TB drive was not done copying when I left in the morning.

 Sure, I could have just left it in Vienna and taken it down to Carinthia next week, but honestly, I feel much better having my work of the last five years in more than one place ðŸ˜„

This is a detail from outside of a shop. It somehow appealed to me.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sensational_alex_harvey_band/sergeant_fury.html">Sergeant Fury</a>" by The Sensational Alex Harvey Band. I have it on a collection that is seemingly not available any more, and it currently is only available on two other collections, thus I simply link to one of them. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4q-rRCaG50&feature=related">live video</a> as well.
