This one is from yesterday. Not a good day photographically, but I don't want to bother you again with my river images, and besides, the best I've already posted ðŸ˜„

 The image was taken through the very dirty window of a pawnbroker's shop. In processing I had not much choice but to go with the grit.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/how_can_a_poor_man_stand_such_times_and_live.html">How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times And Live</a>", performed "Live In Dublin" by Bruce Springsteen and the Sessions Band. Great music, and the video on YouTube, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1_1g0WAwoU&feature=related">live for the BBC</a>, is not bad either.

Hmm ... funny, do you notice how the image matches the colors of the record cover :-?
