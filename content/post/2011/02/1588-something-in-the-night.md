It's Friday, I'm on the train and I have no image for today. Here is one that I took last October. I've processed it today, roughly following the pattern of "<a target="_blank" href="/2011/02/1586-lets-go-joe.html">1586 - Let's Go Joe</a>". 

 After long searching I finally settled on a title that is probably not bad, and the song certainly ain't.

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/something_in_the_night.html">Something In The Night</a>" is from Bruce Springsteen's 1978 album "Darkness on the Edge of Town". There are lots of live versions on YouTube, so I just had to pick one. Here it is from a recent concert <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oaGsxfGoVY">2009 at the Paramount Theatre</a>. Just incredibly good.
