OK, here's one final image for tonight. It's Wednesday night, shortly before midnight. This is an image, that I took on my way home from work. 

I like street corners and I like to photograph them just like this: diagonally across. You'd expect those shots to be very static and boring, but in fact they can be very dynamic, and doubly so, when I manage to catch a biker. The timing was intentional, the yellow security vest was pure luck ðŸ™‚

 Cab Calloway was one of the classic interpreters of the "St. James Infirmary Blues", and because I collect versions of that recently, I just bought a collection of 40 of his most popular songs. One of the songs that I didn't know yet turned out to be the Song of the Day. It's "Let's Go Joe", and here it is on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KixYSd65Rvg">YouTube</a>.

The collection that I have, is not available in the US, thus I link to another one, but you Americans got it better anyway. You pay less for almost twice the songs. Not a bad deal.
