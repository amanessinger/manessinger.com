It's early Friday Morning, here's one more image, this one for today.

 In German, a "MÃ¼llraum" is a room in an apartment building, meant to temporarily stow away the garbage until the collection service picks it up. Don't know why, I just liked the "signature style" of that scribble ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/champion_jack_dupree/junkers_blues.html">Junker's Blues</a>" by the great Willy DeVille, who has passed away recently. This is from "The Willy DeVille Acoustic Trio In Berlin". See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVeV5UgZ6qA">another live version</a> on YouTube. The quality is not so good, but then, there is always the album ðŸ™‚
