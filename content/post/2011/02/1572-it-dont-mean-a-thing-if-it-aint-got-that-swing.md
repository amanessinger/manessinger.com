Sorry, I was busy, and then I kept paralyzing myself over a title for this post ðŸ™‚

 Here's the image for Wednesday. The title probably won't mean a thing, so I just used it to present one of my recent acquisitions, "The Great Summit - The Master Tapes" by Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. The album was recently recommended in a comment (Thanks!) and, as always, I was only too willing to buy it.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/duke_ellington/it_dont_mean_a_thing_if_it_aint_got_that_swing.html">It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)</a>", and YouTube has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8qGa4Yh2qs">just that version</a> for you.
