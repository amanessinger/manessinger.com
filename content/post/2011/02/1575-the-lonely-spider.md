Saturday we had a spectacular sunrise, but for the rest of the day Villach was under a dense cover of clouds, and finally in the evening we had a maybe even more impressive sundown. I saw both, enjoyed both, and did not take any photographs.

What you see here is an old image, one that I found by accident, and as I could connect it to the music that I wanted to present, I stuck to it. 

Last summer, at August 1, I took the image using a Panasonic DMC-TZ7, in the US also known as ZS3 (it completely escapes me why a company would call a product by different names in different markets, but that's Panasonic's problem). I think that for a crop from a 10 mpx point and shoot it is not bad at all.

 The Song of the Day is "The Lonely Spider" from Lhasa De Sela's third and last album, the 2009 release "Lhasa". I got it, together with the first album yesterday, as a very early birthday present. And really, it is exactly my music. Had I, by any accident, discovered the album myself, I'd have bought it instantly. 

Only when looking up this incredibly talented Mexican-Jewish-Canadian singer, we found the shocking truth about her death from breast cancer. She died on January 1, 2010, at the age of 37, almost nine years younger than I am now. Hear the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8_yoVJBkLQ">YouTube</a>.
