I forgot to mention it in the last post: the snow in Monday's image, that was authentic. Winter is back.

 The Song of the Day is "Hard To Handle" from the soundtrack of The Commitments, the 1991 Alan Parker movie after a novel by Roddy Doyle.  Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_tOW2TWmtY">clip from the movie</a>.
