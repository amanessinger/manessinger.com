It's past midnight, I'm in may hotel room in Františkovy Lázne in the Czech Republic. This is an old spa that, among many others, the great German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used to visit. I have no idea how it fared through the days of Communism, but today it has regained a splendor that I did not expect to find. A beautiful place and you can be certain to see more of it and its surroundings in the next week.

 "Twilight" is the Song of the Day. It's the last song of Melody Gardot's 2008 album "Worrisome Heart". 

It starts off as an instrumental, followed by a ghost song after a long pause. Oh dear, it was really funny that first time so many years ago, but can we stop that nonsense now? The song is nice though. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhcBugK7SMw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
