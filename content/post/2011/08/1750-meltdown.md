Here's the last post for today, showing an image made on Tuesday. Title and song are a bit forced, but it's past 11 pm and I have worked for 12 hours. Sorry, that's as good as it can possibly get today ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "Mahamantra Meltdown" from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Das_(singer)" target="_blank">Krishna Das</a>' 1998 album "Pilgrim Heart". Maybe not a good match for the image but, boy this is joyful music! Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcrXFCLig3s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
