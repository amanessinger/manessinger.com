Well, things are back to normal. My desktop computer here in Vienna is working again. I have a new graphics card (Nvidia GFX 560), memory is up to 8 GB, and instead of one almost full 2 TB drive for my images I have now two with plenty of space. Feels good ðŸ™‚

 The image was not really taken in space and the rockets are not really rockets but rather dirt on the backside of a frosted glass pane. Still, the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_bowie/i_took_a_trip_on_a_gemini_spacecraft.html" target="_blank">I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spacecraft</a>" from the 2002 David Bowie album "Heathen". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxpCMZpUiP4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
