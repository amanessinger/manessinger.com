Interesting image. I had already uploaded it in color, but somehow it didn't satisfy me. A yellow/black face on a dark gray wall, that should have worked, only it didn't at all.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/spell.html" target="_blank">Spell</a>", the "footnote to howl" by Allen Ginsberg, a truly hypnotic text, interpreted by the great Patti Smith (did I say I have all her albums now?) on the 1997 release "Peace and Noise". Hear a words-only version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LV0uGNs3n8&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
