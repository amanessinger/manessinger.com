Be assured, it's not my problem that I have no images. My problem is, that I have no time to process them. I may need to relax (which should be the whole point of vacations, right?), see, take images, and when I'm back home, I think I will find a proper way to present what I've accumulated. Could even be a book. After all, it's <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/HomePage" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a>, right?

Let's see.
