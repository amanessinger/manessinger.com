Today the weather forecast recommended to "enjoy the last rays of the sun". I certainly did.

 Pink? I have not that many songs with "pink" in their title. Some albums, yes, Pink Floyd, sure, but song titles? I have an ingenious version of the "Pink Panther Theme" though, interpreted by Bobby McFerrin. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGclw7O9KeM&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
