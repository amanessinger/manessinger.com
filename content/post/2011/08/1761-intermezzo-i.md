OK, I've made up my mind and the procedure for the next days is as follows:

I'll post images, but I won't even try to match titles to images and titles to songs. It simply takes too much time. All posts will be named "Intermezzo". There will be a Song of the Day, but that will be completely unrelated to the image. All songs will be by Jarom√≠r Nohavica, a Czech singer-songwriter whom I heard on the radio yesterday while we had an excellent dinner at the restaurant <a href="http://www.rudybaron.cz/" target="_blank">Rud√Ω Baron</a> in Franti≈°kovy L√°zne.

The music reminded me strongly of Italian singer-songwriters Fabrizio De Andr√© and Francesco De Gregori. It's something in his style, but it is also a certain kind of softness in the Czech language.

The waiter could not tell us the name of the singer (or could not understand us), but some Google searches later I am certain I've got the right man.

 Of course I immediately tried to buy the few albums available via Amazon.de, but imagine my surprise when I was told that I can't, because of "regional restrictions". Cool, huh? I can't buy a Czech singer while being in the Czech Republic! Die, MAFIA, die!!!!

The Image of the Day was taken at the backside of the wonderful baroque church of Chlum Svat√© Mar√≠ (Maria Kulm). They wouldn't let me take images from the inside. In fact I have never seen such an insulting number of "Photography forbidden" signs as in this church. Well, don't get me started.

In any case, this image illustrates that I have not yet given up on the D300. There are still some things that the LX5 can't do üôÇ

The Song of the Day is "Pane Prezidente" by Jarom√≠r Nohavica. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0XciX1cXIY&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
