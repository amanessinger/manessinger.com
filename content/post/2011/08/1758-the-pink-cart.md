And now for something completely different: an image of today ðŸ™‚

 I saw this cart when I was on my way to work. It's really no cart to be drawn by a bicycle, it replaces the front wheel of a bicycle, which makes the bicycle actually a tricycle, albeit a strange one.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/cartwheels.html" target="_blank">cartwheels</a>" from the 2004 Patti Smith album "trampin'". Not a perfect fit for the title, but extremely good music. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1WlmTN3Rck" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

And here we are. Four posts in a day and I'm not even in Carinthia yet ðŸ™‚
