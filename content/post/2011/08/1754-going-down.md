I'm writing this on my laptop. My desktop (the one here in Vienna) seems to need a new graphics card. At least I think that's what's wrong. It's hard to tell when you can't see anything. I'll try to get a free or cheap replacement, just to verify that it was really the graphics card. A computer really is a Tamagotchi, and when you've got around ten yourself or in your family, then things start to get tedious ðŸ˜„

 Anyway, that's the reason why I have not posted for three days.

The Song of the Day is "Going Down" from the 2010 Creepshow album "They All Fall Down". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYWYF-fZuRw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
