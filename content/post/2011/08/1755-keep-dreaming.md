I'm on the train to Carinthia now, and like so often I'm trying to catch up. Tuesday was the day, I took this image in a park on one of my ways to work. The graffiti in the background went on like that for at least twice the length, I made some other images with the tree centered, being on the right side, without the tree and some details, but this one won.

 For me there is a dream-like quality in the subject, and therefore the Song of the Day is "Keep Dreaming", again from the 2010 Creepshow album “They All Fall Down”. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQDFd0WB54Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
