Next one. I'm still on my way to Carinthia, here's the image of yesterday, Thursday. 

 Originally the bike was blue, this is a combination of Photoshop's B&W presets "Infrared" and "Neutral Density" plus some more layers.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/who/naked_eye.html" target="_blank">Naked Eye</a>" from the 1971 Who album "Who's Next". See them on YouTube, performing "Naked Eye" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AIU-EHSnCc" target="_blank">live in 1970 at Isle of Wight</a>.
