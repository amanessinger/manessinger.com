Actually the day was much better than predicted. In the early afternoon I was even swimming. The rain began later, when I returned home, and it's still raining, although it has not cooled down that much.

These pipes are from the construction site that is where my morning view was ðŸ™‚

 For no particular reason the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_bowie/a_better_future_remix_by_air.html" target="_blank">A Better Future</a>" from David Bowie's 2002 album "Heathen". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boX8zNyhaL4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
