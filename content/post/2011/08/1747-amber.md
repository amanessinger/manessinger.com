Here's another attempt, and again gold didn't really convince me. It looked much better than yesterday's landscape, but this time I craved for more contrast. A B&W layer in "Overlay" mode did the trick, and apart from increasing contrast, it also shifted the colors towards amber. Not really bad, I think.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tori_amos/amber_waves.html" target="_blank">Amber Waves</a>" from the 2002 Tori Amos album "Scarlet's Walk". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYY7mLUUY-4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
