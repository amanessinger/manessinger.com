Today we've been in Karlovy Vary, also known as Karlsbad. This is the oldest of the west-bohemian spa towns and it has all kinds of luxury that you can imagine. Fashion designers, jewelers, whatever you may lust for, here it is concentrated. 

So are the tourists. And it is clear, it can't be any other way. In order to sustain all that luxury, Karlovy Vary needs all those tourists. Not only the rich and the famous, also the masses who come by bus, who fill the streets all day and who leave late in the afternoon. Everyone contributes, everyone spends a few Coronas, and the sum of it is the crazy splendor of Karlovy Vary. 

 I probably wouldn't spend a week here, but visiting for an afternoon is interesting.

The Song of the Day is "Ostrava CernÃ¡" by JaromÃ­r Nohavica. It's not about Karlovy Vary but about his home town Ostrava, but at the moment we are not picky ðŸ™‚
