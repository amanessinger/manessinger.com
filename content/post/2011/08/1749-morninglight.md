It's Thursday night, I write the second post for today, this time with an image made yesterday morning. Sorry for the delay, sorry for being generally unresponsive at the moment, I'm just a tad short of time.

 The Song of the Day is "Morninglight" from Amanda Jenssen's 2010 album "Happyland". It seems I haven't used that song before. I wonder why. Can there be a title more suited to photography? Not a bad song either. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEFYoC3r1_k" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
