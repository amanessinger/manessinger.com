I made only a few images today and I can't really tell if the Image of the Day is good, even passable, or not. I've stared at it for too long, I've twisted it, and now I would need some distance.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20110831_160328_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20110831_160328_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> What I do know is that I like this bicycle image. I think it's satisfyingly balanced.

I liked it in color, and when I tried B&W, it somehow stuck, but without necessity. It's interesting: So many of my decisions are basically random, and that's not only when it comes to colors. It really goes through my whole life, and I have the suspicion that I'm not the only one. We come to the crossroads, we go one way, not knowing what the decision implies, without the option to go back and try the other way. And still we are able to enjoy our lives. 

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/the_ties_that_bind.html" target="_blank">The Ties That Bind</a>" from the 1980 Bruce Springsteen album "The River". There are many versions on YouTube, let's try a very early one. Bruce Springsteen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-EDQEgESvw&feature=related" target="_blank">live in December 1978</a>.
