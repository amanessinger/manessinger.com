Here's an image made yesterday near our lake. Summer lawns are hard to photograph. You see them in their entirety and say, "Wow, how many flowers!", but when you look at the pictures, you see some small, unimpressive, colored dots among all that green. It's hard to get the feeling across.

 In this case I've tried to go low and play with the pink flowers and a white diagonal to create some dynamics.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joni_mitchell/the_hissing_of_summer_lawns.html" target="_blank">The Hissing Of Summer Lawns</a>", the title song of Joni Mitchell's 1975 album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=qaXpREI_CqU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
