Once, while SÃ£o Vicente was still a monastery, this room was the refectory of the monks. Today (and in its current design since 1933) it is the <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?ie=UTF-8&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPante%25C3%25A3o_da_Dinastia_de_Bragan%25C3%25A7a" target="_blank">PanteÃ£o da Dinastia de BraganÃ§a</a>, a pantheon, which tells us something about the self-perception of kings ðŸ™‚

Ask someone returning from Yellowstone ðŸ˜„

Had I looked into Wikipedia (or Google's image search) before the visit, I could have concentrated on finding a truly unique view. 

Who knows, maybe something like that really exists and it does not force you to climb the tombs (and consequently spend a night in jail, I guess). But even if, for a first visit I much prefer to come as a naive visitor, to see with the eyes of the uninitiated. In other words, to trade in the joy of surprise for a better image does not sound like a good deal. I'd rather come back another time.
