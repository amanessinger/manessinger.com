Along the sides of the cloister of Lisbon's Cathedral we find a few altars. The one in the Image of the Day is dedicated to Saint Antony of Padova, surprisingly a man born in Lisbon. I certainly didn't know that.

Sometimes it's good to have a small camera ðŸ™‚

Thus we have to read this altar like a comic book.
