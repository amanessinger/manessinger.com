I fondly remember a trip to southern France in (most likely) 1989. Then I was using a Minolta camera, the equivalent of today's compacts. It had two or three focal lengths that you could choose from. It was not a zoom lens and I suppose the focal lengths were around 28, 50 and 85&nbsp;mm, or, if there were only two, they could have been 35 and 70&nbsp;mm.

Whatever it was, of course it used real "full frame" film and, knowing I would take images in churches, I had packed some ISO&nbsp;400 rolls.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_110027.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_110027.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> It was a disaster. The camera blew the highlights of the windows and when the color images were developed and printed by some cheap lab, the lab pushed everything into a grainy mid-gray.

Here you see two versions of the same image from Lisbon Cathedral's window rose. The dark one is the JPEG dirctly out of the OM-D E-M1. I have carefully metered to not blow the highlights, and the image was taken at ISO&nbsp;250. In the Image of the Day you see what I could make of it by pushing the shadows in Lightroom. For me this looks like a problem solved.
