We've left the Cathedral, following Rua Augusto Rosa along its north side and then Rua Limoeiro further up the hill, where we reached Miradouro de Santa Luzia. This is one of those magic places that give you a sudden and often breathtaking view over city and river. For now we duck behind a wall and just have a glance through a pretty window.
