These small motor carts, in Lisbon commonly called Tuk, are a major means of tourist transport. I didn't use them but many tourists do. It's a bit like the Fiacre, the horse-drawn four-wheeled carriage so common in Vienna. I haven't ever used one of them either, although you see them everywhere.

By the way, remember my confidence to find from Santa Luzia to São Vicente without looking into a map? This was the place where I realized I was wrong. The road signs in the background of this image point to another Miradouro and Igreja da Graça. Well, I thought, why say no to another view over the city and another church?
