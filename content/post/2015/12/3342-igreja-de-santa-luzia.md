Igreja de Santa Luzia is a small baroque church of the Maltese Knights Order. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_122844_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_122844_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It was closed while I was there, and as far as I've seen on the Internet, I have not missed much. It is not the interior of the church, why this is a mandatory sight in Lisbon.

This is the Miradouro de Santa Luzia. Well, we'll get to the view in the next post. For now I'd like to show you the image made of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo" target="_blank">Azulejos</a> on the southern face. It depicts a war scene from the reconquest of Lisbon.
