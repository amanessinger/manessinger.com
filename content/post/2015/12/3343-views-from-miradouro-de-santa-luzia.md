Of the various Miradouros in Lisbon, Santa Luzia is probably my favorite.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_115506_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_115506_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I had luck and the weather was excellent. The sky was almost always blue, always with some harmless clouds for extra visual interest ðŸ™‚

I've only been there at noon time, and I strongly suppose it won't be different in the evening. Early morning could be an option, but then, this spot was too far from my hotel to make me try it.

Even better would be the higher terrace of the cafÃ©, but I guess it will be closed in the morning.

The other one with the cupola is PanteÃ£o Nacional, the National Pantheon. We'll get to both in due time.
