I'd call this an impressive ceiling. From São Vicente it was only a short walk to a church that we've already seen from Santa Luzia.

This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Santa_Engr%C3%A1cia" target="_blank">Igreja de Santa Engrácia</a>, also known as Portugal's "National Pantheon". It is remarkable not only for its beautiful architecture, but also for its long time of construction. From groundbreaking in 1681, it took 285 years to completion.

We'll see a few more images tomorrow.
