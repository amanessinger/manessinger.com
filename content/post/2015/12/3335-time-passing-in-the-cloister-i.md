Oops, it's almost 11&nbsp;pm, I've missed my deadline, this post should have appeared at 8&nbsp;pm as usual.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_111547_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_111547_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, the reason is twofold: on the one hand I am technically sick, on the other hand I've played around with my current pet project and time went by. I'm writing it in Java and, frankly, I have not written any Java in years.

Of course Scala would have been even more elegant, but after reading about and learning Scala, I've rejected it for its learning curve. At least I know Java - or so I thought. Turns out there is a lot in Java 1.8 that's very new to me ðŸ™‚

By the way, the images were made in the cloister of Lisbon's Cathedral.
