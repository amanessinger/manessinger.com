Nice number, huh? I started this blog in October 2006, that's more than nine years ago. There were times when I tried to promote it, when I wrote gear reviews and Photoshop tutorials, and really, those post still carry traffic.

At least that was so the last time I looked, which was probably half a year in the past.

OK, now I've looked. During the last month I had aroud 50 page views on average, on a few days as low as 25, some spikes going to 100. That's pretty much 10% of what it was in its high times. I don't care. It's ok. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_110317_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_110317_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I have many more views on Flickr, about a 1200 a day, 1700 on good days, rarely below 700. Of course it's much more when I get explored once every few months. Do I care? Yes, enough that I post regularly, enough that I routinely put images into groups. But then, this will also go away and in the long run we're all dead ðŸ™‚

And this blog? It is where I write down thoughts, where I publicly rant, where I share experiences, where I not only display images, but also put them into a context.

The context of this post is the ambulatory of Lisbon's cathedral. Behind it lies the old cloister, and that's where we go tomorrow.
