Here's another detail from Miradouro de Santa Luzia. If there is anything remarkable at all here, then it is the superb highlight detail in this image. In the reality of bright noon light everything was just white and hurting the eyes. The original from the camera did capture the highlight details, but at the expense of an overall dull, grayish appearance. Processing from RAW made a world of a difference. I like this image.
