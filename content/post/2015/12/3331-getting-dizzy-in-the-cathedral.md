Inside of the Cathedral, like in so many old churches, we see a wild clash of styles.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_105621_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_105621_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> That's only natural in centers of power. Their rulers always had the money to spend, and often instead of building a new church in a new place, they chose to modernize one of the churches present.

Normally here in Europe the absence of a baroque altar in a romanesque church (or even the absence of gothic traces) indicates, that the church was given up (like it happened to some monasteries), or that the church is in a part of a country, that suddenly lost its dominant position. That's what happened to south-western France, where you still see a lot of romanesque architecture, because in later times power had shifted to Paris and the money to modenize simply was not there.
