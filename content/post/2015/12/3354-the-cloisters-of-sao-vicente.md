You may have suspected it from afar: SÃ£o Vicente is pretty much of a sight. In fact it has much more the character of a royal palace than that of a humble site of prayer.

We'll see more of them in one of the next posts.

SÃ£o Vicente was obviously built as an architectural representation of power. I wouldn't want to live there, although I have to admit, the view from the roof is one to die for ðŸ˜„
