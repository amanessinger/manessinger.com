Lisbon has a set of old tramway lines that are a major tourist attraction. They cross the whole historical center, down one hill on steep slopes (the steepest for adhesive rails systems in the world), across flat Baixa, and then up the next steep hill. By tramway you can reach all of Lisbon's major attractions, and while I wouldn't use it all the time, one or two rides are mandatory. Here I was lucky to stand immediately behind the driver.
