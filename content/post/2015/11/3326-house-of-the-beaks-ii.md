Today the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa_dos_Bicos" target="_blank">Casa dos Bicos</a> is home of the <a href="http://www.josesaramago.org/" target="_blank">Jos√© Saramago Foundation</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_103738_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_103738_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> As I already said, I have not been in any museums in Lisbon. I just didn't have the time, but when I think of it, I probably would have skipped this one anyway. 

When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saramago" target="_blank">Saramago</a> got the Nobel Prize, I read his book "Blindness", expecting something like Albert Camus' "La peste", and in a way this was not completely wrong. 

Saramago is more absurd, more abstract, and there is less human warmth. When I read the book, I was tentatively inclined to read more, but although I bought "Seeing" a few years later, I never read it. Somehow "Blindness" had failed to deeply touch me.

Am I missing something?
