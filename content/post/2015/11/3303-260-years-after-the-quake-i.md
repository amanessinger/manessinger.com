As I've already mentioned, in 1755 a catastrophic earthquake shattered Lisbon. The church of the Carmo Convent, the Igreja do Carmo, at that time the biggest church in Lisbon, collapsed, and while other buildings were re-erected in the following decades, or, where the devastation was total like in the Baixa, whole districts were built new from scratch, this church on the hill was left in ruins. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150902_162858_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150902_162858_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> To the present day it is a monument for the victims of the quake. 

The only part that did not cave in was the choir. Today it houses the Museu Arqueol√≥gico do Carmo. That's where we'll go tomorrow.
