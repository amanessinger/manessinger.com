15 minutes after yesterday's image, when the Baixa already lay in deep shadow, there was still a bit of sunshine to be seen from the bottom of the steep canyons that are the Mouraria, the poor quarter on the north-western side of the hill crowned by Castelo de SÃ£o Jorge, an originally Moorish castle. There, in the labyrinths on the steep flank of the hill, the Moors had to live after the re-conquest.

It's not a pretty place and still the poor people live here. Nevertheless, there are surprising gems to be seen.
