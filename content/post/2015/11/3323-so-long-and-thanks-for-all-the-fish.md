Canned sardines are specialty of Portugal. Here in Austria we love the brand "<a href="http://www.nuri.pt/en/index.html" target="_blank">Nuri</a>", produced by "Pinhais" near Porto. 

It's the only widely available brand of Portuguese sardines in olive oil, with a slice of carrot, a slice of cucumber, a piece of laurel leaf, a pepper corn, and of course the obligatory piri-piri. Their product is made from freshly caught fish, it's excellent, but at the moment due to fishing restrictions it is not available.

I probably should have bought some cans of different brands not available in Austria at the shop you see in today's picture. They have a wide variety, and it is fascinating to see a whole shop dedicated to nothing but canned fish. In the end I didn't and instead ate my sardinhas grilled at the restaurant. Bacalhau and sardinhas, you can't and shouldn't avoid them ðŸ™‚
