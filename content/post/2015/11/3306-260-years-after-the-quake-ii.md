Remember the <a href="/2015/10/3297-bridges-high.html" target="_blank">Elevador de Santa Justa</a>, that giant elevator from the Baixa up to Bairro Alto, that I decided not to ride up because of the queue of tourists? Well, for the Image of the Day I am standing atop. I just went the bridge from the convento to the top of the tower and then a few steps up to the platform.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150902_164716_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150902_164716_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The second image is again from inside of the ruins of the church. I can't remember where I've read it, maybe in some travel guide, but the church is said to have collapsed during a well attended mass. The the vault was made of stones, so you can imagine that nobody within survived.
