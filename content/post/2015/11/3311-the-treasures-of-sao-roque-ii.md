Quite a ceiling, huh? You may notice purple and greenish halos in this image. Well, the Olympus 7-14/2.8 PRO is remarkably immune to ghosts and flares, but once you have to shoot into strong lights while overexposing, all bets are off. I could and probably should have gone B&W here, but then, the colors better reflect the feeling of being there.

The reason why I had to overexpose so much (1/4&nbsp;s at ISO&nbsp;320 and f2.8) is, that the church is much darker than it looks here. In fact I can see more on the image than I could while being there.
