For a change, here is a fairly recent image, taken with my new Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95. I finally got it. Manual focusing, yes, that's tedious, but when you decicate one camera preset to manual focus, it is pretty easy.

My manual lens mode is configured as M-mode, automatic white balance, fixed ISO 200, one function button set to enter 14 x zoom in the viewfinder, half-press of the shutter button to exit zoom. Focus and clickless aperture are set on the lens, the rear wheel varies shutter speed. If I need exposure compensation (which is not available in the E-M1's manual mode), I switch a lever and get ISO on the front wheel. I may play around a little more and find an even better configuration, but for now that is what I use.
