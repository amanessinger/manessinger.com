Usually I have my camera with me, but the first time I recognized the complicated pattern of shadows on this multi-layered fence, I didn't. Thankfully the weather situation was consistent and I found the exact same light next day. Lesson: don't leave home without a camera. You might be as lucky as I was, but be warned, regret is the rule, not the exception ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is one more time "Complicated Shadows" by Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO6CkCi1lo0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
