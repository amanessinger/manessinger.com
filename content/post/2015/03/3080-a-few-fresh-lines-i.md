Given the not unsubstantial price of the Olympus 75/1.8 and the fact, that the lens' quality is more than appropriate, it might seem strange that I hardly use it. But then, it is an equivalent focal length of 150 mm after all. That's nothing you routinely use, or if you want to, you've got to get in the mood. Seems like that's where I am at the moment ðŸ™‚
