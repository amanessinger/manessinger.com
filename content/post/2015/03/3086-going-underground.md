This is "Schottenring", probably my most favorite Underground station in Vienna. You can take images from all sorts of angles, and I probably have. I may even have taken this image, but then, whenever I'm there and see the lines, I simply can't resist.

The Song of the Day is "Going Underground" by The Jam. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE1ct5yEuVY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
