These two images show parts of some dismantled machine near a power plant at river Drau. I have no idea what it is, but the parts are big, they go way over my head, and they are heavy.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150221_123350_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150221_123350_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The second image shows more of the context and its color temperature is more accurate, while the Image of the Day was kept deliberately abstract.

The Song of the Day is "Rusty Scars" by Summer Heart. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lrXQeYZi6c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
