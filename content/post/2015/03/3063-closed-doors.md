Rosenbach may once have been a mining village and it was also the last railway station in Austria when your train went south to Yugoslavia.

Today there is no Yugoslavia any more. The state on the other side of the mountain range is called Slovenia, and like Austria it is part of the EU.

Everything has changed for Rosenbach. Mining has long ceased to be profitable and people traveling to Slovenia go by car now, taking the new highway tunnel. Rosenbach has lost any importance - and it shows, for instance here at the railway station.

The Song of the Day is "Closed Doors" by Mellow Mood. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHJNwhQHtz4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
