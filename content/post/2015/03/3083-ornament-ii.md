This is another take on the concept of ornament. The place is a glass-covered patio in Vienna's <a href="http://www.palaisevents.at/en/palais-ferstel.html" target="_blank">Palais Ferstel</a>, a rather overcrowded station in every sight-seeing tour in Vienna, home of the famous CafÃ© Central. It was built 150 years ago in a neo-renaissance style and was intended as a bank and stock exchange, but only only ten years later it was found too small for its original purpose.

Hard to imagine that the original idea was to "avoid unnecessary luxury", but then, necessity is vague concept ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is once again "Ornament" by Moss. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j2sogH2tGI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
