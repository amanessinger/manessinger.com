A few days ago I had a short "zoom phase" and this image has also been taken with the tiny Panasonic 12-35. It's actually a pretty fine lens and although f3.5 at the wide end is rather slow, the E-M1 and its stabilization can even handle low light images such as this one. Handheld on a rainy night at ISO 1600 and 1/5s.

The Song of the Day is Tom Waits' "Little Drop Of Poison" in Rebekka Bakken's rather interesting rendition. Hear at least part of it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5EckpXlfeg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
