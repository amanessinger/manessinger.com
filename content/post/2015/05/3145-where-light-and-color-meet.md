No, I didn't color these lamps in Photoshop ðŸ™‚

They are in front of a nice Chinese restaurant round the corner of where I live in Vienna. OK, some corners, but they have a beautiful garden to sit in and in late Spring it's nice to sit there and enjoy the early evening and the spicy food.

The Song of the Day is "Where Light And Color Meet" by RyIm. Not my favorite music but I simply couldn't resist the title. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp-mf2JHEyA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
