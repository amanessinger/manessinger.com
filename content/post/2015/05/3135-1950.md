You've seen these houses a few times and even the blossoming trees were featured slightly more than a week ago in "<a href="/2015/05/3127-spring-street-i.html" target="_blank">3127 â€“ Spring Street I</a>". I don't know exactly when these houses were built, but for me they have a distinctly 1950s charme. 

What that is? Well, actually hard to tell. It's that sane and safe world of the US movies of that time, movies that were made at a time when the US fought a war in Korea and children in schools were told how to "duck and cover" in case of an atomic war. 

Crazy, huh? But that's how it is. I was born in 1964. The 1950s were well before my time. I know them only from movies that we can see now as full of propaganda and wishful thinking. It was a time determined by a witch-hunt for communists, a time full of crazy paranoia. Doesn't make a difference though. It's what I learned to see as the peaceful Good Times. And - to be fair - for many people it was just that.

The Song of the Day is "1950" by Amedeo Minghi. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed5Yf1mtTc0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
