This tiny, tiny plant growing in front of the half-relief on the flower pot behind somehow touched me. Looks like a child between its parents.

The Song of the Day is "We're A Happy Family" by the Ramones. Well, now that I think of it, it's probably not the right song for the mood of the image, but hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQlM59sDJVo" target="_blank">YouTube</a> anyway ðŸ˜„
