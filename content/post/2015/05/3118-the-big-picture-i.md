Panoramic images like this one look like crap on the web, don't you think so? Well, you probably should have a look on the <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/17058429710/sizes/o/" target="_blank">full size of 15385 x 4522 pixels on Flickr</a>. That's slightly more than 64 megapixels. Looks better? Thought so ðŸ˜„

Lightroom CC has stitched this image automatically from 13 source images with plenty of overlap, taken at manual settings with the Olympus 75/1.8 at f8. I've rotated the result slightly and applied sharpening. I see no stitching errors whatsoever. It just worked. Took some minutes though ðŸ™‚
