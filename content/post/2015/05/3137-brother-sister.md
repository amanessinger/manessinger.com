Only a cat picture, but, you know, the Internet is ruled by cats and so is our apartment in Villach ðŸ™‚

I took the image through a window and had to crop it heavily. When I tried to take another image from nearer on and from exactly the front, Gamer had already decided to run off the terrace. I'm happy with what I got.

The Song of the Day is "Brother Sister" by Sahara Beck. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1qTdrUwUQA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
