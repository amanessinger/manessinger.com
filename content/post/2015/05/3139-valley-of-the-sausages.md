As I recently said, that I currently take almost all my images with the 75/1.8 is mostly due to the fact that I don't feel like having the time for changing lenses ðŸ˜„

As a walkaround lens, an equivalent focal length of 150&nbsp;mm may seem awkward at first, but I can asure you, that's completely wrong. It takes some time until you get the feeling for it, but after a few hours you naturally see through that lens like through any other lens. And, that it's an extraordinarily beautiful lens of matching quality, does not hurt either ðŸ™‚
