There is a promenade between river Danube and those houses. Many of them are old, built in the 1950s or earlier. It's a garden district with special rules governing the maximum size of buildings. Maybe it's less desireable to live there than it looks, considering the constant stream of people passing your garden. But still, If I look at that window and how the sparkling river is reflected, I can't help feeling a little envious ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Water Reflections" by Lucia N. Caruso and Pedro H. da Silva. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpM78FtT33M" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
