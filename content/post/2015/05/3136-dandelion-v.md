Here's one more B&amp;W image of spring flowers. Actually it looked fairly well in color this time. What you really see well in B&amp;W though, is the impeccable quality of the 75/1.8's bokeh. Look at the out-of-focus bright spots in the background. There's no trace of rings or hard edges. It's all soft and creamy, just as I expect a lens with that price tag to be ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is one more time "Dandelion" by Kacey Musgraves. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwVNUlG2hM8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
