Spring flowers in B&amp;W??? WTF?!?

Well, why not? Of course like so many of my B&amp;W images this is accidental. It didn't overly impress me in color, instead of immediately throwing it away I tried a conversion to B&amp;W - and I liked it. There is something in the way the out-of-focus fore- and background draw, that I find very interesting. 

The Song of the Day is again "Dandelion" by Kacey Musgraves. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwVNUlG2hM8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
