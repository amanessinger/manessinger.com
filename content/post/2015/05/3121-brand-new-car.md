I'm busy at the moment. Very busy.  I hardly make images, and if I do, I try to squeeze as many of them as possible out of each rare afternoon walk. Of course I don't change lenses that much either, not during one walk, hardly between walks. 

One result is, that all you currently get, has been taken with the 75/1.8, the other, that I find myself being increasingly fond of shallow DOF again. That's a potentially expensive obsession, given what 0.95 lenses Voigtlaender has and how much they charge ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Brand New Car" by The Rolling Stones. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d34rkIcICQ4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
