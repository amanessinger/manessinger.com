This is a detail from the cover of a box mounted to a house wall, containing electrical installations, probably for street lights. There are lots of them all over the city and they all look the same.

The material is some plastic composite with fibers, and in bright light it sparkles. That and the texture never fail to catch my attention.

The Song of the Day is "Lightning" by David Byrne &amp; St Vincent. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trIG9vQbVXA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
