I've passed by this Chinese restaurant called "Beautiful China" very often, but always on my way to one of my favorite Pizza restaurants in this part of Vienna, near enough to for instance go there after work.

There are other Chinese restaurants around, one of them I like really well, thus it is unlikely you'll ever find me inside this one. I sure like the tree in front though, and how the color of its leaves takes up the red of the word "Restaurant" on the sign.
