I have no children, do you? Girls? And if so, do you worry about pink or do you simply accept it? And if you're in opposition, how do you cope with the fact that shops almost force you to buy girls' clothes in pink? How do you cope with peer-pressure on your girls? 

Or do you just give in and buy Kitty bags? Is it even worth opposing the pinkifcation of our girls?
