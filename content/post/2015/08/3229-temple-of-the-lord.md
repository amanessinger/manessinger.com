OK, I suppose you've guessed it, I've even announced I would buy it, it's the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 7-14mm f/2.8 PRO. 

As you read this, I've been having it for more than three weeks, while people still complain about unavailability via Amazon and other online dealers. It has a few advantages to buy at local premium dealers, at least as long as you're lucky to live where there's still one left.
