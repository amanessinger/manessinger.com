When you spend nine hours a week on trains, you better begin liking railway stations. While yesterday's image was taken in Vienna, this one is from Villach.

The sticker on the escalator spells "Sauber", meaning "clean". Kind of a hopeful declaration, but maybe it even works. At least the railway station is clean indeed ðŸ™‚
