Let's wrap up this nightly walk through Ferrara with some more images.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150615_215325_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150615_215325_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I'm pretty sure the Image of the Day shows the northern side of the Palazzo Municipale as seen from the Castello.

Ferrara is not a big city. Even it's center is almost devoid of people before midnight. 

Nightlife? Not really, but that was not why I was there anyway.

Three and a half days, not more. That's substantially less time than it took me to process all the images, not to speak about blogging it, and we're not even through yet.
