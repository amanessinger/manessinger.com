I fully expected to get back to my Songs of the Day after having finished the series about Ferrara, but the truth is, I have grown weary. The complexity of only giving a title to an image after I have found a song, of never uploading untitled images, all that slowed me down. 

Actually I liked the concept. It gave me an excuse to spend time with music, and that's something that I rarely do these days. On the other hand, one has only so much time in one's life, and the continuous searching for songs was more stress than it was worth. I suppose I'm done with it, I likely won't have Songs of the Day any more on this blog. I may lose some viewers (some people found my blog searching music), but I can't help it, it's better to do what I enjoy in a sustainable way, than to risk closing the blog altogether.
