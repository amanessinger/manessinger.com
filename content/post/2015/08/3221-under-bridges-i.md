Near to where I work is a cross of two highways, an Underground line (in that section high above ground), a railway line and a few small streets dodging below all those bridges.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150628_155939_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150628_155939_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> There is also a backwater of river danube, a remains of the originally meandering river, big enough to row a boat and to swim, and therefore the remaining space is filled with small gardens and cottages.

I've crossed it many times on the highways, regularly by train or Underground, but I've never actually walked there. I didn't know what exactly to expect, but during a free hour I took my camera and went to find out.
