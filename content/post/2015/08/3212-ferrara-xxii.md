Ferrara almost automatically invokes the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Bassani">Giorgio Bassani</a>, and his book "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_the_Finzi-Continis">The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</a>" is what I read while we were there.

I hadn't even known that he is buried in Ferrara, but the first thing the woman at the entrance of the Cimitero ebraico di Ferrara asked us was, whether we were there to see Bassani's tomb. It came as a surprise to us but, yeah, that's why we were there.

Here it is.
