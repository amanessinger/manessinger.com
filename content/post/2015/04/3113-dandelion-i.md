Here's an image that may look like having been subjected to a color filter in Photoshop, but in fact I just had a dandelion very near the lens, covering it partially ðŸ™‚

By the way, I don't know how many of you have ever tried viewing this site on your phone, but if you have, chances are you've shied away. I've optimized my theme "<a href="http://aquoid.com/news/themes/suffusion/" target="_blank">Suffusion</a>" for the desktop. I'm pretty sure I could find a way to make it mobile friendly within Suffusion, but somehow I never bothered.

Enter Google. They have decided to rank pages lower when they are not mobile friendly. Which is a good move by the way. Who if not Google is in a position to enforce change?

I read about it on the Internets, but somehow I didn't care. Only when I saw it mentioned in a newsletter from my provider Justhost, I clicked on their link that led me to "<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">Google's Mobile Friendlyness Checker</a>".

It was total failure, but on the result page they gave me some tips for WordPress, and lo and behold, within a few minutes I had installed the plugin "<a href="http://www.wptouch.com/" target="_blank">WPtouch</a>", that provides automatic mobile detection and a very mobile friendly alternative layout. I didn't go pro, the default layout works fine for me, I only changed header and link colors in the settings and that was it.

Manessinger.com is now officially mobile friendly. It took me less time to do it than to write about it ðŸ˜„
