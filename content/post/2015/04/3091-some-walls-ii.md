Compositionally this is not very different from yesterday's image, only that I'm playing with shallow DOF now. Technically I am near the sortest focusing distance. This is not macro range (the 75/1.8 can't do macro), but it is near macro territory. The tiles are maybe four inches high in original.

The Song of the Day is still "Some Walls" by Peter, Paul and Mary. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhSafmqmIRw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
