Good equipment does not necessarily make you a better photographer, but undoubtedly it makes you reckless ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150321_123111.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150321_123111.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> On a sunny day, with sidelight falling through small windows into a dark church, contrasts are extreme and well over what cheap cameras like mine can record.

Well, only joking. A medium format digital camera may likely do sufficiently better, but in general this is the domain of HDR, at least unless you're reckless and willing to substantially open up the shadows.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150321_123134_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150321_123134_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> So I did in both of these images. As you can imagine, the dark one is the camera's version of the Image of the Day. Apart from lightening it up, I have also used some pretty extreme perspective correction. 

The result? Well, I'm definitely satisfied. Actually, now that I look at it, I consider downloading DxO Optics pro and trying its highest quality noise reduction and perspective correction on these images. I've tried their PRIME noise reduction once under Windows and its results were excellent. The only problem was speed, but that may be better now on my new Macbook Pro. We'll see.
