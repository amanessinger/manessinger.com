We had a reorganization at work. Unlike the last one, that had dragged on for half a year, this time it was as quick as I've ever seen. Basically it was announced and the next day the new organization was formally in place. "Rock Star Management" - I like that ðŸ˜„

Of course the first order was to just keep working as if nothing had happened, but already you can feel change. I like change as well. It's a chance, it's exciting, it revitalizes. Like Spring ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Red Buds" by William Elliott Whitmore. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFCQnbdsdWA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
