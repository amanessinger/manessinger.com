What else has happened? I've switched to the Creative Cloud edition for photographers, meaning I've been running Lightroom CC and Photoshop CC for a few days. 

This was a planned upgrade. I have waited until Lightroom 6 came out and now I have a working Photoshop again. It's good to have it, although I have not missed it that much since I switched to the Mac.

People say it's fast. Well, I have a fast Mac and it was fast before. Photoshop is a lot faster than CS3 on my old VAIO laptop running Windows, but that was to be expected.

The upgrade ran totally seamless. I paid the subscription, downloaded the installer, logged into my account, selected Lightroom and Photoshop for installation, and it kept Lightroom 5 for me. Lightroom CC upgraded the catalog to a second version, this was a quick and unproblematic conversion. All in all it couldn't have been easier. In a few days I'll uninstall Lightroom 5, convert all my older catalogs as well and delete the old Lightroom 5 catalogs.

Adobe is an interesting company though. As a programmer I am apalled by the quality of Flash (basically an endless source of security holes), but their Creative Suite is one of the best pieces of software that I've ever used. OK, different teams, different application domains, but still, you wouldn't expect the two products to come from the same company.
