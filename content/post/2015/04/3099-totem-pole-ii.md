It's pretty hard to get an image like this "right". Were the colors more saturated? Sure. Did I try to bring that on screen? Oh yes! Did I fail? You bet 😄

In the end I used a much cooler color temperature than I'd have expected, just to keep detail in the overwhelmimg yellow. Then I pushed saturation of the oranges and maybe pushed them a tad towards red. Is this "correct"? Hell no! Does it work? Yup! Hope so 🙂
