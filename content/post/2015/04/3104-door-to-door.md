These houses may have been built in the fifties or sixties. I don't know, in any case it's been a long time since. Two apartments, door to door, each with a cellar, a first floor, maybe an attic and a small garden on each side. 

Once this kind of architecture may have seemed cramped for someone from the country, but by today's standards it is outright spacious. Nobody builds like that any more.

The Song of the Day is "Door To Door" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7_4UehvyOs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
