"Why did he take that image", you think? Yeah, why did I?

There is something in this slide-along-a-wall perspective that has always attracted me. What? I have no idea. It's something about control of the view, something about that perspective where you feel a kind of progression but never learn how the story ends. I guess it kindles my imagination.

The Song of the Day is "Some Walls" by Peter, Paul and Mary. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhSafmqmIRw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
