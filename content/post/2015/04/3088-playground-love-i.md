By the time you read this, the web application that I've been working on for more than two years will be in production - for better or worse. Like in all such efforts conducted after the old-fashioned "waterfall" model, things get pretty hectic at the end. I write this post more than a week ahead of publication, and I expect a terribly busy week with not much time to think and even less for photography ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Playground Love" by Air. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZWo7Zm_n8c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
