You may ask yourself how the software release turned out that I was talking about and that I'd suspected it would eat most of my time. Well, just as expected, mostly really well, but as soon as things get big, even the load of a successful release gets quickly overwhelming. 

Accordingly you don't see much originality as regards titles lately. Sorry, can't help it.

The Song of the Day is again "The Gate" by Belle and Sebastian. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv8JDqcKaXU" target="_blank">YouTube</a> if you didn't do so yesterday.
