If you don't take yesterday's elevator, you can always walk this street, pass the car selling Fado records, and even if you buy something, you'll still be faster ðŸ™‚

Processing this image was pretty hard and I am proud of the result. Why? Extremely harsh contrasts in the bright noon sun, white or near white buildings in the background, a relatively dark car in the foreground. But look at the white sign on the shop. There's plenty of highlight detail and the raised shadows don't drown in noise at all. For me it doesn't look like bad HDR either. All made in Lightroom from one exposure.
