Can this be a boy's Vespa? 40 Years ago it could have been. It wouldn't have been likely, but today? Can't imagine.

Do I like it? Yes. I don't use scooters at all (at least I haven't had one for 30 years), but if I were to buy a used one and if I had an offer for this specific Vespa, I'd buy and use it immediately. But then, I'm a relic from the last century ðŸ˜„
