Here's another example for extreme contrast. On the JPEG out of the camera the inside of the shop was completely black. Of course by raising the shadows selectively in post-processing, I have raised noise as well (I'd deem the shop's inside being in ISO 6400 territory), but by selectively applying noise reduction, I was able to get a pretty satisfying image.

Would have a full-frame camera done better? Sure. Would a film camera have been able to come even close? Never, ever ðŸ™‚

As regards dynamic range and malleability of image data we have advanced so far, that any complaints would be laughable. I declare the problem of dynamic range solved ðŸ˜„
