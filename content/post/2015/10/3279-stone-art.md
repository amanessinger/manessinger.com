Here's an image from a detail of a sculpture in Gänsehäufel, the biggest bath in Vienna. The sculpture may be from the 1970s, but I could be wrong. 

In any case I like the flat look. The image was taken at f8 on a Micro Four Thirds camera, thus it has plenty depth of field, and the abstract subject makes it almost impossible to tell the actual three-dimensional shape.
