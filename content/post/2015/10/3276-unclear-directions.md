It's funny. While the layered architecture of modern computers enables tremendous progress by boosting developer productivity (both on the hard- as well as the software side), it also makes the systems brittle, unnecessarily complex, and - if things go wrong - impossible to diagnose for anybody but experts. Well, even becoming an expert (or maintaining that status, once reached) gets harder and harder. 

Windows 10 is much more stable than Windows 7 and a Mac is a pretty awesome machine (as long as you play by its rules), but both will invariably fail in almost mystic ways. You won't know why. They won't tell you. Maybe you'll find something on the Internet if your problem frequently occurs, but maybe you'll just hunt from page to page, in search of the elusive hint.

Pathetic.
