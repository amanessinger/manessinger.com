On Largo Chiado, the small place right between Rua Garrett and Largo de Camões, there are two churches. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150902_102051_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150902_102051_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the north side is Igreja Da Nossa Senhora Da Encarnação, the darker one, not only as regards light. The Image of the Day is from there.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150902_102732_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150902_102732_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the souther side we have Igreja Nossa Senhora do Loreto. These churches are not particularly important, Nossa Senhora do Loreto is not even marked on Google Maps, but when I have a church on my way, I can rarely resist looking in. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150902_103008_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150902_103008_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I own two tripods, both of them stowed away in cabinets, one in Villach, one in Vienna. I brought none of them. For me and the kind of images I make, the time of tripods is over. Therefore these images and all otehrs in Lisbon were taken handheld, with shutter speeds down to 0.4 seconds.
