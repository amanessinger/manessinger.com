Some time ago I've spent a few days in Lisbon. I arrived at night, spent three full and a half days and have seen what you can see in such a short time, mostly the usual sights. I have not been in museums, I have not been in the suburbs, but other than that, I guess I've got a good impression.

I returned with 1244 exposures, 226 of them did I find worthy to process. They could fill this blog until next summer, but I'll churn through them a little bit faster, frequently using more than one image per post. I'll also mix in a few of the images taken since. At least that's the plan ðŸ™‚

It made me smile ðŸ™‚
