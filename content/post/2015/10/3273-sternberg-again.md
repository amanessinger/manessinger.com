Every once in a while I post an image taken at Sternberg. Sternberg is a church on top of a small mountain in Carinthia, well, not a real mountain, more a big rock. It's exposed on three sides and therefore can be seen from afar.

In winter it's high enough that it frequently is above the fog. And it is near to Villach. Lot's of reasons to bother you with it ðŸ™‚
