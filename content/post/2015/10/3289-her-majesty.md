Here's an image taken from Praça do Comércio along the shore to the east, where by chance a big ship lay, the luxurious liner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Queen_Elizabeth" target="_blank">Queen Elizabeth</a>, one of the largest passenger ships in the world. The image was taken with the 40-150/2.8 at 150&nbsp;mm and f5.6. For post-processing I made use of Lightroom's "Dehaze" function and a few gradients.
