A few days ago <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Alexievich" target="_blank">Svetlana Alexievich</a> received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature. At 1&nbsp;pm the Committee announced the decision, one hour later I saw the news, five minutes later I had her book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Voices-Chernobyl-History-Nuclear-Disaster/dp/0312425848" target="_blank">Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster</a>" on my tablet. That's what I currently read. 

I chose that book, because I know a lot obout the catastrophe, because it happened in my early adult life, and because I often think about it. At that time we were told not to eat mushrooms. So much time has passed since, but it is just about the half-life of Cesium-137 or Strontium-90. Half of what rained down on Europe is still here. What do we do now? We eat mushrooms and call ourselves an intelligent species ðŸ™‚

How the book is? Well, it's a collection of short chapters, each one based on one or more interviews with survivors and people who lived there, were evacuated and returned. It is a book that does not try to relate the events, instead it tries to give us a feeling for how it is to have been there, to have lost a beloved partner or a child. There is this certain mix of love and death, that is heart-wrenching. Absolutely recommended.
