Lisbon is a tourist attraction and you see it. It is not an empty shell like Venice though. Real people live there.

Lisbon is famous for many things and most of them you see on this image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo" target="_blank">tiles</a>, sardines, the tramway and of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado" target="_blank">Fado</a>, the music of the poor, a genre with its roots in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, today still popular in the songs of Madredeus, MÃ­sia, Cristina Branco and Mariza. I failed to hear a concert and I failed to hear live Fado in one of the countless bars in Alfama, Mouraria and Bairro Alto. Next time ðŸ™‚
