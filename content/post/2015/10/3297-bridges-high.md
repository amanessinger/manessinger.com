This is the bridge leading from the top of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Justa_Lift" target="_blank">Elevador de Santa Justa</a>. Theoretically that is the most exciting way to get from the Baixa below up to Bairro Alto. In practice you have to wait in a queue of tourists ðŸ™‚

The only time I took the elevator, was the going down. Interestingly enough there were no crowds at the top and the experience was all the same ðŸ˜„

As regards my computer troubles, I don't have any problems with Lightroom 2015.1.1 on El Capitan. None at all, and meanwhile I have used it a few times for browsing, cataloging and processing images as well.

In one direction I have WiFi on the train, for the other direction my phone as hotspot is good enough. Today I have cancelled the contract with my provider. I had a plan for unlimited DSL at home in Vienna, combined with mobile Internet limited to 5&nbsp;GB per month, all for 35&nbsp;â‚¬. Instead I'll get DSL from a small provider in Carinthia. Same speed, 10 Euros less, no mobile, but instead a static IP address and no daily cut-off.

That's something I have always wanted. It will give me the option to use my underutilized computer in Vienna as a server. In the long run it will serve this blog. Unfortunately I have just paid to JustHost for the next three years, but I expect to make the switch much earlier.
