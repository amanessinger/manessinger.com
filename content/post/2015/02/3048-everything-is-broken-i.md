Herbert is dead. You didn't know him, I hardly did. He was the requirements manager who wrote the requirements document for the program that I currently build, alongside a group of other programmers.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150215_125018_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150215_125018_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> As requirement docs go, it's not bad at all, but like all requirement docs it is universally hated. What a strange and sad legacy to leave. And then, it does not matter at all.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150215_125536_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150215_125536_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Herbert may have enjoyed his work, at least he certainly seemed to set pride in perfection, and whatever the facts were, whether he liked his work or hated it, he's dead regardless.

I don't know how old he was, but I suppose slightly younger than I. 

The building in these images is the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wotruba_Church" target="_blank">Wotruba church</a> in Vienna. You'll see more of it in the next posts.

The Song of the Day is the Dylan classic "Everything Is Broken", interpreted by Bettye LaVette. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAoRejeFSfU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
