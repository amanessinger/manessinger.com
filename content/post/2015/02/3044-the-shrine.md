Same place as yesterday, this is a big shrine opposite of the church, along the wall of the graveyard. It's open on three sides and I can only assume that it was used by pilgrims when the regular church was too small.

The Song of the Day is "Shrine" by The Cave Singers. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5T4Ng-agac" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
