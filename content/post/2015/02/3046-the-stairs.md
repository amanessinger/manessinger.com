When I was in that pilgrim church in Gallizien, I went up to the gallery to take an image down into the nave. Contrasts were so extreme and I was too lazy to bracket exposure, thus the images from inside are nothing to be shown. Instead here's the peculiar staircase down from the gallery.

The Song of the Day is "The Stairs" by INXS. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ0ECPllTk0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
