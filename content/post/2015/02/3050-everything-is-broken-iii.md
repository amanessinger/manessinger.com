I like that church. The artist obviously didn't care about architectural conventions at all and the building looks refreshingly different from everything I've ever seen. On a less sunny day I would probably have opted for B&amp;W, but here the contrast of blue sky and warmly colored concrete works well for me.

The Song of the Day is again "Everything Is Broken", interpreted by Bettye LaVette. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAoRejeFSfU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
