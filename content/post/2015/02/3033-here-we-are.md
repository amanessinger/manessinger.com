To move from the cenetr of a big city to its periphery is kind of a shock. Everything is different and most of all the distances. While using a car is stupid where I lived for almost 30 years, here almost nobody walks. You need a car, at least unless you live three minutes from a supermarket and five from work, like I do. On the other side, it's interesting to walk where nobody walks and to take in slowly what drivers only see rushing by. 

The Song of the Day is "Here We Are" by Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfmMMhVsXRw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
