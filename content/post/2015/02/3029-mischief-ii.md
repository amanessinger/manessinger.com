This was a nice ASUS monitor with IPS panel and a resolution of 1920x1200. I used it as secondary monitor for my Macbook and as primary for the small computer that acts as my secondary computer for working remotely. The Mac is a great machine, but running a Windows remote desktop on it via Citrix is inconvenient, because the Citrix plugin has all sorts of problems with keys on the Mac. Keys like "@" or "[" or a few more. Keys that programmers need all the time. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20141229_100151_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20141229_100151_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Attaching a PC keyboard does not help either. I tried it, but then it's the PC keyboard that sends the offending keycodes. There may be a solution to that, but I decided to solve it in hardware instead. The computer on my secondary desk is a tiny ZOTAC Z-Box MA320, running on an AMD quad core 1.5 GHz Kabini, utilizing a 60 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. It runs Linux, is completely silent, looks like a small WiFi router and sits in a bookshelf. That's where this monitor was attached.

Gamer didn't like it.
