Chris Klug's photography blog "Patterns of Light n' Dark" is gone. I have no idea what happened, but where his blog was, there's now a single post by soeme game designer reporting about his "<a href="http://chrisklug.net/blog/?p=5" target="_blank">Return from Interstellar Space</a>". Last time something like that happened, I found out Bill Birtch was dead. I sincerely hope Chris is well.

The Song of the Day is again "Everything Is Broken", interpreted by Bettye LaVette. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAoRejeFSfU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
