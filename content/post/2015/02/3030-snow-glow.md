When I saw the reflections of the morning sun on snow and ice in the parking area, I was not at all sure that I'd be able to get the effect into a picture. Indeed more post-processing than usual was needed, but I think the result was worth it. I suggest you click through and look at the biggest size, though. Otherwise the effect is pretty much lost.
