Outside of the graveyard walls there are two marble plates with gilded inscriptions, listing the names of those unfortunate citizens fallen in the two big wars of the last century. Heroes they are called, fallen in defense of their country. Which is mostly wrong.

Their lives were wasted for the ambitions of Austria's nobility and, later, following the insane ideas of an Austrian monster.

Fallen in Stalingrad? Ukraine? Poland? At the Atlantic? Never mind, defense of our country it was. Not.

The Song of the Day is "The Wasted" by Graveyard Johnnys. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFv6EIc_1n4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
