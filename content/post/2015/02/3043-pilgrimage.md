Gallizien is the place. It's a small village in Carinthia with a church devoted to St. Jakob, or as the say in Spain, Santiago. This small village was on one of the countless pilgrim routes to Santiago de Compostella, in medieval times a pilgrim destination second only to Rome. Santiago is located in Galicia, and that's how this Carinthian village got its name.
