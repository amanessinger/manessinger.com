I have no idea how old the pavement in front of yesterday's shrine is. The stones look old and worn, but really, there's rarely a stone that doesn't look old, does it?

Still, I like to imagine nailed leather boots on the feet of pilgrims, who stood there, listening to a latin sermon, and some of them even understanding it. I imagine sinners and saints, beggars and merchants, all standing here for an evening, coming from afar, going towards another country, a random assembly of people who would never ever return.

The Song of the Day is "Cobblestones" by The Communions. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCm4luUZXhU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
