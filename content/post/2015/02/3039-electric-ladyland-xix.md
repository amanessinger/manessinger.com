At the time you see this, I'll be working again. I've no idea though, when I'll have the next photo opportunity. I guess I won't be walking outside the first days, because just that the fever is gone, does not mean I'm rid of the cough ðŸ™‚

This is part of my long-running "<a href="/tag/electric-ladyland" target="_blank">Electric Ladyland</a>" series and the Song of the Day is of course "Have You Ever Been (to Electric Ladyland)" by Jimi Hendix. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_3dbTYAhho" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
