Climate change. These images were made in Vienna on Wednesday. I was on my way to Carinthia, where I spent two icy days.

The Song of the Day is anything from Sting's album "If On A Winter's Night". See the performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTQgKBPQkf0" target="_blank">live at Durham Cathedral</a>.
