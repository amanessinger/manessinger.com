I used to care much about equipment. Not so any more. I have a camera that's ideal for my needs, lenses that are ideal given my quality requirements and weight restrictions, and what I use at any given time is more or less randomly chosen.

At the moment I walk around with the 12/2.0, 25/1.8 and 75/1.8. Double the numbers and you get the "full frame" equivalences. 12, 17, 45 is another triad that I use fairly often, 12, 25, 45 is the third. Whatever I choose, I can go for shallow DOF if I want to. I rarely feel the urge though. I once did and I still use it at times, but any feeling of obligation is long gone ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is still "Stone Walls" by Three Tall Pines. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqmaDLKvmQ8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
