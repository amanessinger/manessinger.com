I lied. Here's one more image from my walk in Villach. When I left the car and walked down to the river, I came along a heap of garbage in front of a shop, neatly piled up around a light post. I couldn't get a proper angle at it and so I didn't take the image.

When later I walked back to the car, coming from the other side and on the other side of the street, I saw the garbage again, this time at the end of an oblique line across the street. Two diverging lines, one leading into garbage, the other into an uncertain future. Maybe there's an allegory buried somewhere ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "One Way Or Another" by Blondie. Songs from my youth. Oh how I love them! ðŸ˜„
