If I didn't know that this is my shadow, I wouldn't recognize it at all. The Stairs make it look as if I'd wear a coat, while in reality I wore a short winter jacket ðŸ™‚

By the way, I just found out, why I didn't get email notifications for comments on my blog. I had tried a few things like using different email addresses (in the end all being redirected to my GMail account), but whatever I did on server side didn't help a thing. Why? GMail had decided that those mails were SPAM.

In other words: keep an eye on your GMail SPAM folder. It may contain more than you expected it to ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is one more time "I Got Stripes" by Johnny Cash. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LRpCv7siI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
