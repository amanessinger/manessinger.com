There are people who strictly dislike graffiti and tags, but I'm not one of them. They have a certain quality of mystery that often fascinates me. I have no idea what this means or if it means anything at all. I believe it does, because if it didn't, the whole idea of creating them would feel even more alien to me ðŸ™‚

Here we have something that looks distinctly asian to me. Or like a message on a forein planet. It could be an ad or a warning to stop immediately or bear the consequences. There is a certain aura of danger as well. Or at least graffiti fascinate me, because they allow me to dream wild dreams ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is still "Stone Walls" by Three Tall Pines. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqmaDLKvmQ8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
