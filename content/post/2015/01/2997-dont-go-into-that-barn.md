A strange image and title for New Year's Day? Yup, and I can tell you, it's pure coincidence. No thoughts or ideas were harmed creating this post ðŸ™‚

This is kind of a barn, standing freely in a meadow, intended exclusively for drying hay. It's more than a simple hayrack though, actually a barn with hayracks instead of walls. Does that make sense?

Anyway. The Song of the Day is "Don't Go Into That Barn" by Tom Waits. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRSBmalHDV0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
