This piece of moss on the wall was lit by beautiful late sunlight. I saw it and immediately loved the color, only to later find out, regardless of what I did in post-processing, that every magic was gone. I just couldn't reproduce the colors of my memories. Everything looked bland or simply wrong.

That's one of the moments when I frequently try black and white. And indeed it works for me.

The Song of the Day is still "Stone Walls" by Three Tall Pines. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqmaDLKvmQ8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
