This is a pretty interesting church in Villach. Looks a lot like a worn down factory building from the 70s, and in fact it was built in 1967. It's in dire need of repair but I like the concept.

The Song of the Day is "This Is God's House". Hear the Crossroads Choir on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54bS7wWHe_A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
