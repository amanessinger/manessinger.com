<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6tschach-Mauthen" target="_blank">Kötschach-Mauthen</a> is a small market town in south-west Carinthia and Kötschach is the northern part of the community. Both together have a population of approximately 3,400 and - one of the most interesting churches in Carinthia, re-built from 1518 to 1527 by Bartholomäus Viertaler, a local architect famous for his peculiar style of vaults. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20141226_153751_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20141226_153751_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I was there while bright sunlight shone through the narrow gothic windows, creating the most extreme of contrasts. It's nothing the OM-D E-M1 can't master, but you have to be careful not to burn out highlights in the walls.

The Song of the Day is the spectacular "Church" by Lyle Lovett. See a fairly recent live performance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2OrBhVMKrk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
