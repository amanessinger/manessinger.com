On one of the few sunny days I spent a short time out in the cold, freezing and taking images. At this time of the year, when the sun is so low and the houses are so high, you have almost no other option than to point your lens up against the sky. Almost.

The Song of the Day is the old Rodgers and Hart standard "There's A Small Hotel", interpreted by everyone and for instance Ella Fitzgerald. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuD8InlCk-Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
