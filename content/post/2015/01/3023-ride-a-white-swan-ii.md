Great swan, exactly the right moment, exactly the right light, wrong lens though. I suppose the 40-150/2.8 would have been the tool for the job. Or even the lowly 40-150/4-5.6.

Would I have pointed the right lens with the right zoom at the right moment into the right direction though? Sounds like a lot to get right, huh? Considering that, I actually feel good with what I've got ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is one more time "Ride A White Swan" by T-Rex. Smells like youth ðŸ™‚
