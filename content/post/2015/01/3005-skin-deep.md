This is the corner of one of the big Shopping centers in Vienna's Mariahilfer Stra√üe. A few years ago it got a new, fashionable skin, but in reality they all are of a dying species. Really, I often try to buy locally, but most of the time prices are much higher than online, personnel is incompetent, or they don't have what I want and offer to order it. Thanks a lot, that I can do perfectly well myself. Not that I don't understand their problems, but that's how it goes.

The Song of the Day is "Skin Deep" by Melissa Etheridge. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jbT8v7xhvM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
