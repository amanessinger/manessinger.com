and this is his bus. 

"There Is A God" is a song by "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33Miles" target="_blank">33 Miles</a>", a "contemporary Christian band" from Tennessee. "<em>Contemporary Christian</em>"! Did we have any of those in my youth? I'd have thought not, but I can be wrong. 

In any case, the case they're trying to make in this song is rooted in an inability to explain, in a scary sense and a lot of hope and belief. Somehow the exact proof eludes me, but as a song it is not bad. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV8c6amvevg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has the song.
