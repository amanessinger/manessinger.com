At the moment I'm living quite on the edge. Weather is bad, work is plenty, and the few time left is mostly spent reading. What images I have, are all taken from one or two walks. I hope you still bear with me.

Same wall as yesterday, a few meters along, a face that reminds me of the images of African cannibals in my childhood's Disney books. Quite before political correctness came along. What do you see? And what is in an image at all?

The Song of the Day is "Face To Face" by ATB featuring Stanfour. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoYrjCkN3Q4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
