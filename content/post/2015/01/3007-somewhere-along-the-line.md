You can guess from the quality of my image, I'm a little bit in a hurry, I can't be too choosey. Apart from that, this post has to get out in half an hour and most of the time my Internet access will be unstable to say the least. So please let's be civil and pretend the post were worth posting or maybe even worth looking at. Thanks a lot ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Somewhere Along The Line" by Billy Joel. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0HqbScHZH0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
