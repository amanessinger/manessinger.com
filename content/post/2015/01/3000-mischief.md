3000 days, none skipped. It's still a daily photoblog in the sense that I post daily, although during the last year I have written in advance, often a week's worth of posts written within four hours on the train. It's less immediate, but it makes me a happier man. Well, <a href="http://basicinstructions.net/basic-instructions/2014/12/30/how-to-make-a-public-service-announcement-yet-again.html" target="_blank">I'm not the only one</a>. ðŸ™‚

The cat is Gamer, our second one, Kazuuu!'s young brother, who has surprised me yesterday by jumping from the sofa up to the top of a file cabinet (a real one!), and then across a door to the next one. I have no idea how he'll do it, but I bet he'll make it to the roof next year. At reast that seems to be one of his resolutions ðŸ™‚

It's New Year's Eve here as I write this and my own resolutions are pretty modest as the blog and photography go: to carry on. I won't be famous and I will certainly not invest big time promoting the blog. As every year I may add one or the other piece of equipment, but there is no need at all.

What I do want to do, is finally starting my next programming project. I have spent half a year learning JavaScript and giving up on it (not static, an endless source of trick programming, based on convention and daily changing fashion, usable for the client if you need to, no fun on the server if you strive for enterprise integration and long-time projects), another half a year learning Scala and also giving up on it (complex as a languge, attractive, but with an uncertain future, plagued by low productivity due to the need to learn new frameworks for everything).

It's got to be Java. <a href="http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/" target="_blank">I know a few things about that</a>. It is a less sexy language than Scala, less sexy even than C# (can I have "var" please?), but with Java&nbsp;EE&nbsp;7 it has the world's best and most stable ecosystem for enterprise applications. In the end language does not matter. I strive to transcend language anyway. "Azzyzted Development" will be a tool-based approach heavily relying on patterns and code generation. 

That's it. Gamer and I wish you all the best in 2015!
