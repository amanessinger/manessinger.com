This is the building where I work now. It's less ugly than the last one, and much to my surprise I found it very functional. Of course big organizations are what they always are, regardless of the enclosing architecture ðŸ˜„

Still, it's a good place to work. And only 18 minutes away from the river. 

The Song of the Day is "Work Song" by Hozier. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkL6wR0xghA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
