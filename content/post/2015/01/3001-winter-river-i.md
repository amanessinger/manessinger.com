We've finally got winter. This time snow and cold came in the right sequence: first the snow, then the cold. This image was taken on a short walk along the river and into town. I just couldn't stay inside and thought, why not take the umbrella and take some pictures? 

Well, I can tell you, in reality the concept of taking photographs amid falling snow is highly overrated ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is by So Far So Good (that's the band, really!) and it's called "Winter River". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6C7XLqoebw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
