I've taken the "Big Bag" to Ferrara, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lowepro-SlingShot-All-Weather-Camera-Black/dp/B000KX8TCI" target="_blank">Lowepro SlingShot 300 AW</a>. Mind you, this is not a really big bag. It can hold a DSLR with three small-to-medium lenses, one of them attached. Something like my old D300, a 50/1.4, a 28/1.8 and maybe an 85/1.8. That was a pretty typical configuration then. A 70-200/2.8 would have been much too big.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150614_154444_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150614_154444_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In Ferrara I've used the OM-D E-M1 with the 12-40/2.8 PRO and the 40-150/2.8 PRO, and because at that time I didn't have the 7-14/2.8 PRO, I fell back to the excellent 9-18/4-5.6. In the meantime I've bought the 7-14/2.8, but it will take me a while to get through Ferrara ðŸ™‚

You may remember the image of the Saint from two days ago. That had been taken in no light at 150&nbsp;mm, f/2.8, ISO&nbsp;1600, 1/25s and was still underexposed by two stops. You see the same values (but not underexposed) in today's long shot towards the altar. Stabilization is pretty amazing ðŸ™‚
