This is a cool image. Really. I've cooled it way down in terms of color temperature ðŸ™‚

It's also an image that I've manipulated. I've increased clarity of the flowers and decreased clarity towards the edges. I might also have added a negative vignette to give the image a more dreamy look ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Poppies" by the divine Nina Simone. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOe1e6kbrBM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
