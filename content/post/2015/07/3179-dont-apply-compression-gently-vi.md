A long lens carves a small frame. The smaller your angle of view, the more options you have to direct the camera to something never seen. It's as simple as that. Nevertheless it always takes me some time to get adjusted to this kind of seeing. 

The Song of the Day is still "Don't Apply Compression Gently" by Courtney Barnett. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zigz8WYs73Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
