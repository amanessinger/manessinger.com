In an image like this, once you're already abstract, abstracting a bit more by using black and white sometimes helps tremendously.

The wall fragments of this garage were bright. Bringing out the tonal range made the image interesting, but at the same time it increased contrast and saturation of the little color there was, basically reflected blue in the shadows and a yellowish tinge in the highlights. Color did not contribute anything though, and taking it out of the equation made the image better.
