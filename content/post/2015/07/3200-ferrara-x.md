At the height of its power, Ferrara was extended to the north, with one main street leading straight from the Castello through the new district, all along to the northern gate, the Porta degli Angeli.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150615_095105_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150615_095105_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This is the Corso Ercole I d'Este, created between 1492 and 1510, named after the powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ercole_I_d%27Este,_Duke_of_Ferrara" target="_blank">Duke of Ferrara</a> of that time.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150615_100058_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150615_100058_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> As Ferrara lies in the plains near a river (the great river of northern Italy, river Po), most of the city is built with burnt bricks, and because this is a historic street, its surface is still cobbled. That's not the most convenient surface for bicycle riders, therefore it is pretty common to see them on the sidewalks of this street. 

Near the beginning of the street, still near the Castello, the center of the city's power, the church of the mighty order of the Jesuits is situated.

It's the style of the time and the order, something I had never been able to warm up to.
