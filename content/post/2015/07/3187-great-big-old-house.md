This is our former office building, right in the middle of Vienna, designed by a famous architect, a bit worn down by the years, but still in acceptable shape.

Well, the plan was to tear it down and replace it with a shiny new office building that would generate income for the municipality. Then came the crisis, and at the moment there is an abundance of unafordable office space in even better locations. The building still stands, the plans seem to have been shelved temporarily.

The Song of the Day is "Great Big Old House" by Robert Cray. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c8flRxTzM8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
