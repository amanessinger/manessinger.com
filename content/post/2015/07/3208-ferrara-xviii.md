We are back to Castello Estense, the magnificent castle at the center of Ferrara, and this time we come at night.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150615_215832_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150615_215832_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The moat and the multitude of reflections along with the convenience of a well stabilized long lens, that makes for a satisfying and relaxed shooting experience.

Going to B&amp;W gave me the option to stretch contrasts in a much more dramatic way than would have been possible in color.

The other image was taken at ISO&nbsp;1600, but was pushed at least two stops in the shadows.

I wonder.

You know, one of the most interesting questions in Science Fiction is, how an encounter with an alien race would turn out. Well, given our history as a species, I ask myself if they'd have any other option than to strive for our extinction? Our earth is heavy with the bones of peoples who didn't survive contact with our "civilization". Peaceful aliens would hardly fare better.
