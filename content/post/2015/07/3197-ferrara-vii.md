Times change and technologies go, but there's hardly anything that doesn't leave a crust on our world.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150615_072505_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150615_072505_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Terrestric television is mostly gone, but we can still see billions of antennae above the roofs of our cities. They are useless now, but they are mounted in unapproachable places, therefore nobody removes them.

Like mushrooms they overgrow our roofs and balconies. That all will eventually be replaced by ubiquitous glass fiber, but I bet the dishes won't vanish, just like the antennae never did.
