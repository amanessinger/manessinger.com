I guess I've already taken a few images of this peculiarly locked door over the years. Bear with me please ðŸ™‚

In reality the title may also be wrong. This could as well be not about locking out but about locking in. There may be a monster inside ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Lock The World Outside" by El Creepo. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILxHAafXHNE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
