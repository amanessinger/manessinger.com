The Cattedrale of Ferrara at night. It's not immediately apparent, but if you closely look at it, there are orange "patches" on parts of the facade. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150615_214059_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150615_214059_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These are plastic nets, keeping loose figures and ornaments from falling. The earthquake, what else? When you think of it, if this happens to you and your house, you just call someone to fix it. If it looks different afterwards, no problem, maybe you like the new look better anyway. 

You can't do that with historic buildings. Whatever you do, it is expensive and needs extraordinary expertise. It's not easy living with a history ðŸ™‚
