I don't know where the idea of colorful umbrellas floating above a main street originates. There are instances in Portugal and South Korea and maybe elsewhere. Fact is, Ferrara did it as well.

Here were two of the original three synagogues, and here is the Jewish museum. They are all closed, you guess it, because of the 2012 earthquake.
