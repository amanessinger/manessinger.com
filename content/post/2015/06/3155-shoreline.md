Dreams of the sea, dreams of the shore and of walking in the sand with bare feet! Or is it just a pattern of dirt, dried up slosh at the side of a busy street in Vienna? 

It's a difference, for sure, but maybe it does not count in an image. Images are illusions, fantasies, dreams, framed and taken out of context. It feels different when you're there, but when you dream about it, you have a hard time telling one apart from the other. And besides, maybe you are like me and even lack all motivation to do so ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Shoreline" by Anna Ternheim. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46Tn7Ps6N9o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
