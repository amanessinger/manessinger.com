For another weeek you'll mostly see images taken with the 75/1.8. From then on ... well, I have a new lens ðŸ™‚

This pietÃ  is stylistically typical for the north-east of Austria. In Carinthia, in Austria's south, you'd see a wayside shrine instead, and it would look like a small tower. It's interesting how much variation you can see in such a small area.

The Song of the Day is "PietÃ  l'Ã¨ Morta" by Modena City Ramblers. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGxbGfZA2nY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
