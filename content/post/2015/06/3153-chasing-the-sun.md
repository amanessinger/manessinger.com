This is exactly what caught my attention while I slowly drove by. Fortunately I could stop almost immediately, walk a few steps back and take the picture. This is a pretty extreme crop, but I've tried and nothing less radical would work.

The Song of the Day is "Chasing The Sun" by some starlet called Hilary Duff. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj6MjDFD1Kw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
