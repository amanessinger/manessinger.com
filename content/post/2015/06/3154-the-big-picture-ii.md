No fishes were harmed in the taking of these pictures. I've climbed up the tower in the main square of Retz, used the Olympus 12/2.0 to take a big number of pictures, and Lightroom made all the stitching for me.

And it did flawlessly so, I might say. Or almost. There is a tiny glitch with an antenna far in the background of the main picture, and there is also a possible artifact in the horizon line. Or the horizon line looks different from what I'd expect ðŸ™‚

The resulting images are in the 40 megapixel range. Of course you who shoot with the latest incarnation of the Canon 5D have this with every shot, but then, I really don't care. I can't remember when was the last time that I printed images. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/456/17832763774_64d9eca597_o.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150514_145924-Pano_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Oh yes, now I do. It was when I moved into my current apartment in Vienna, two years ago. My new walls had space for three pictures. One of them was taken with the 12 megapixel D300, the other two with the 16 megapixel OMD EM-5. All three are A3 size prints that are as big as the free wall space would allow - and all three look great. 

It would be different if I'd shoot stock images or even tried to sell in galleries. I don't do, so an image size that was more than plenty ten years ago is still sufficient for my needs today. After all, it's still twice the pixel count of the biggest monitors money can buy today and more than four times that of my current biggest monitors ðŸ™‚

Btw, clicking on these images loads the original sizes from Flickr.
