I love this lens, I hate its size and weight. I have gone back to the old Lowepro Slingshot 300 AW. That's the smallest bag that I can use with the E-M1 and the 40-150/2.8, and that only as long as I have not mounted the teleconverter.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150530_090158_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150530_090158_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The bag is heavy and sturdy. Not like this old tractor, but it is heavy enought to make me hate it ðŸ™‚

At the moment it contains the E-M1, the Olympus 9-18, 12-40/2.8, 40-150/2.8 and the teleconverter. That all sums up to 3.4&nbsp;kg. The dramatic contrast: if I use the Olympus 9-18, Panasonic 12-32 and the small Olympus 40-150/4.0-5.6 in my usual small Samsonite bag, I get almost the same reach (save for the teleconverter) at around 1&nbsp;kg. Oh yes, and the 7-14/2.8 will be heavy as well ðŸ˜„
