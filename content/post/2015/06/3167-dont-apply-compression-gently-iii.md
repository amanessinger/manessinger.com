This is an image very similar to what I've frequently made in my Nikon days. Need shallower DOF? Just focus a vertical slice nearer. There is no advantage to any camera system with a bigger sensor. That's even f3.5, not f2.8. That's what I've chosen in order to make the old woman in the back at least recognizable as a human being.

The Song of the Day is still "Don't Apply Compression Gently" by Courtney Barnett. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zigz8WYs73Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
