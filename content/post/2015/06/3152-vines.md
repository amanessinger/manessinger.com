The region where this image and those of the last and the next few days were taken, is called Weinviertel ("Wine Quarter"). It is the north-eastern quarter of Lower Austria, with Lower Austria, the region enclosing Vienna, being the north-eastern part of Austria. 

Part of the tradition around here are roads lined with wine cellars. Our name for that is "Kellergasse", and one of the most famous of them is in Zellerndorf. That's the village with yesterday's shop.

The Song of the Day is "Vines" by Emancipator. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUgVnn2YbnQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
