I have no idea what kind of shop this was. There are still holes where the sign once was mounted, but now it is gone as the shop. Time has been cruel to small shops and their owners.

The Song of the Day is "The Old Curiosity Shoppe" by Frank Zappa. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfJPiiQNgFg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
