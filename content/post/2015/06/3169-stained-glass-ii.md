Same church as yesterday. This is less "my work" than yesterday's image. It's a pretty plain depiction of someone else's work. It's a good work though, and therefore I guess you may like it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is again "Stained Glass" by Jon Guerra. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhfpgrqgAso" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
