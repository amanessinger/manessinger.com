A new lens? No, not the 7-14/2.8. That's already been ordered but is not yet available here in Austria. No, it is the <a href="http://slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/1741" target="_blank">Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm f/2.8 PRO</a>, a lens that I had already on order in October and then sacrificed for my new Macbook Pro. After careful consideration I had found it alluring but a little bit expensive for the expected use.

Is it? Well, we'll find out. At the moment it is the only lens on my camera and it will stay there at least until the 7-14 arrives ðŸ™‚
