The EU has always been a wonderful institution for me. It's hard to describe the feeling when I first crossed the border between Germany and Belgium - and there was none. No passport checks, no delay, just driving across a symbolic line at 100 kilometers per hour. That was my first experience with the Schengen treaty. A few years later Austria joined Schengen, and suddenly the borders that I really care for, those to Italy, Germany, Switzerland and later to Slovenia, Hungary and Slovakia, they all vanished. That and the Euro became symbols for a glorious united Europe, a Europe of prosperity and peace.

Yesterday news came that Germany "temporarily" suspends the Schengen treaty.

And this is the point where we have to make choices: <strong>Don't vote for anyone who wants to close your borders!</strong> Nothing good will come from it. <strong>Vote freedom!</strong>
