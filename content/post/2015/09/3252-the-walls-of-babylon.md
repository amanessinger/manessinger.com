Villach is a small town with a population just short of 60.000. It's where I live half of the week and it is what I'd call a town with the "right size".

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150726_163401_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150726_163401_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Villach is just big enough to have all the major chains plus a few specialized shops. There is no dedicated photography shop though. The next is in Klagenfurt, 35 kilometers to the east, but only one, and although you can order everything through them, they hardly have any stock.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150726_162432_lr.jpg "><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150726_162432_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Thus when I feel the need for a new lens while being in Villach for more than a week, I normally end up ordering from Amazon. Or if it's really urgent, I may drive the 150 kilometers to Graz. That's what I did for the OM-D E-M1 ðŸ™‚
