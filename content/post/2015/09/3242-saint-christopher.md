This is a small church in a small village not far from Villach. I have been there once, even with a camera, but the few images I had taken then wouldn't suggest that this is the same church.

And this is only one place near home! Sometimes I think it's impossible to know even one's nearest environment. I could spend my whole life within a radius of 50 kilometers and I wouldn't be able to see all that's worth seeing, know what's worth knowing.

And it's not only the places! Every place looks different at different times of the day, in different weather, during different seasons.

Life is rich.
