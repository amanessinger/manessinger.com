I've been on vacation and I have used the time to read books. So far this year I've read 22 books, thus a total of 30 this year is not unlikely. Wow!

Could be a few more, but the magnitude is correct and that's a frustratingly small number. I may even have more books already bought than I ever could read ðŸ˜„
