I've been using ultra-wide lenses for a long time. I know how to use them properly and what for, but what can you do when you really, really want to try a new lens in a situation where no appropriate subject matter is available? I went to a forest and tried to force my luck.

Nothing substantial came from it, but this image of a lazily arranged stack of wood reminded me of a tired dog. Black and white took care of the boring colors and it allowed me to better work the contrasts. In the end it was more interesting processing the image than it had been taking it. That's how it is sometimes ðŸ™‚
