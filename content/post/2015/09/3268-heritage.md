Living in Europe 70 years after "The War" often means forgetting what a war is. Look at this building in Gm√ºnd, Carinthia. It's part of our rich heritage, a building never damaged by a war, or if so, a building lovingly restored by people who had the time to spare and the surplus to spend. Now google "aleppo after war" and check out the images.

Hitler was a criminal and many Germans were. Most were not. They only earned the ruins. Same with Saddam Hussein and the people of Iraq, same with Assad and the people of Syria. Wars sometimes kill dictators, but most of all they kill innocents. Those who don't get killed are left with the ruins of what generations before have built up.
