We've seen furious ad hominem attacks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanis_Varoufakis" target="_blank">Yanis Varoufakis</a>, and of course he was unprepared for that. 

Well, I wonder how the new leader of British Labour, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Corbyn" target="_blank">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, will and can do. I've seen an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZAn7ZEvwek" target="_blank">interview with him on Channel 4</a>, and actually I was shocked about how aggressive the interviewer was and how obvious his agenda. It was pretty disgusting and reminded me of Nazi "judges" at the "Volksgerichtshof". But then, nobody can say that Corbyn did not know what to expect.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150802_202821_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150802_202821_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Still, it is unclear if any person could withstand a concerted attack of the mainstream media. We've seen in Italy how mighty a media monopoly can be, and how an obvious criminal can use the media to attack political enemies and to thwart all attempts to bring him to justice.

Cameron is not Berlusconi and Corbyn is not opposed by a media monopoly, but still, the media are in the hands of rich people. There is no conspiracy, but then, no conspiracy is necessary either. A concerted action would arise simply out of common interest.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150802_203552_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150802_203552_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Could Corbyn survive even until 2020, the time of the next general elections in the UK? Can any political leader stay in power and still oppose the real powers in this world? Corbyn wants to reign in corporate tax evasion and he wants to get rid of the UK's nuclear weapons. Neither will be in the interest of the US. 

The question is, can any person have a completely clean browsing history? No inconvenient and exploitable secrets? And even if so, governments and secret services have all means necessary to plant false evidence on everybody's computer. If they want to present Corbyn as a child pornography consumer, they can do that. 

So again, in our current surveillance state, in our sick travesty of democracy, in this nightmare of uncontrolled and uncontrollable secret services, secret courts and secret laws, is it even thinkable that a politician makes real decisions based on real facts? Honestly, I admire those who still try.
