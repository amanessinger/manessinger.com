Put your wallet where your mouth is, so they say. Well, I did, and from now on 50 Euros a month go to <a href="http://www.caritas.org/" target="_blank">Caritas</a> Austria. It's one of the most respectable and trusted organizations caring for refugees. Another good choice would have been the Red Cross. Both should be tax deductible wherever you read this. Both are international and you should go to their local website in your own country. If you like none of them, choose another. Just do it!

The amount of the donation is deliberately set a little on the high side. It's considerably more than one percent of my net-income, more towards two, and it is regular. I'll see how that feels over time.

A pack of cigarettes every three days? That's what I've smoked for two months now. I want to stop anyway.

Seven months add up to one <a href="http://www.zyoptics.net/product/zhongyi-mitakon-speedmaster-25mm-f0-95-lens/" target="_blank">Mitakon Speedmaster 25mm f/0.95</a> lens. That's what I've ordered two days ago and what should arrive sometime in October. I ordered it with a second thought, but just one.

Yesterday's naive calculation was of course based on everyone giving the same 1% of net-income. That won't happen. We have to account for the real poor, the greedy, the careless, the thoughtless and the nazis. The poor won't be able to help (though they often do it in surprising ways and to unexpected degrees), to convince the others is our job now.

Go out and do it. It makes you feel good ðŸ™‚
