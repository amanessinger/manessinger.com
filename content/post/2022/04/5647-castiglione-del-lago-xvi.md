And now we leave Castiglione del Lago. Would I spend a few
days just there? Probably not. The water is too shallow for
my taste, and the town is small. 

It would be a nice place to stay though, if you want to be
close to Perugia, and also have access to Arezzo to the
north, Siena to the north-west, Montepulciano and Montalcino
to the west, and Orvieto to the south.
