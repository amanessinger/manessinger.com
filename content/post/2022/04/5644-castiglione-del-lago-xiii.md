We're down at the shore below the castle hill now. I wanted
to take an image of this rusty piece of art, centered
between two poles. Just as I was adjusting myself, three
girls came along, positioned themselves in my subject, and
chatted away my time. 

Well, I took the image, and when I processed ist, actually
two of the girls were in perfect positions, their faces not
recognizable, and the third girl was beside the sculpture in
a non-overlapping way. It took me some cloning, but the
result is better than it would have been without the girls
:smile:
