Inside the chapel now. I think this is not what the light
was, but in neutral light, these would be pretty correct
colors. I've taken this image as a reference to the image
with the door frame, and I've adjusted the door frame to
match. If you compare the two images, this one is just a
slightly lighter version of the previous.

Matching two such images is hard, really hard. You need to
know your tools, but you also need time. Time to do it, time
to pass, time to compare, time to redo it. Did I say it's
hard? :grin:
