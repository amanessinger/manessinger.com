My birthday is approaching. Nothing special, just a 58, but
around that time, OM Systems, the company, that bought
Olympus' camera business, will release a new camera. It's
not yet clear what it will be called, but spiritually it
seems to be the OM-D E-M1 iv.

I own a lot of expensive Olympus glass, so, I probably would
have bought it anyway, if only to extend the relevance of my
lenses. 

Some people hoped for more than 20 Megapixels, some for
extended dynamic range, and it seems, it will only be
dynamic range.

I don't care. What I really care about, is the electronic
viewfinder. Basically they've doubled the pixels, giving it
1.4 times the linear resolution, and that's fine. I'd have
been delighted by less, so this is a welcome surprise.

Other than that, the camera seems to use its 20 Megapixel
advantage to greatly increase speed. 120 frames per second?
Insane. I have no use for that, but it's good to see
progress anyway :smile:
