When the OM-1 was announced on Monday, 7 minutes before the
press conference in Japan began, the initial review on
[dpreview.com](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-1-initial-review)
was already online. My local photo dealer in Vienna also had
it on offer, and a few minutes later, I had it ordered. I
hope to get it next week.

In the meantime I've found, that DxO not yet support the
RAW files, but Lightroom Classic already does.

I've downloaded and processed RAW files from
[dpreview.com](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/om-system-om-1-initial-review#SG)
and
[Imaging-Resource](https://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/om-system-om-1/om-system-om-1GALLERY.HTM).
Indeed, dynamic range is better by approximately two stops.
That's huge. A well exposed image at ISO 25600 is borderline
usable, but ISO 12800 is definitely the new 3200. Also, the
noise characteristics are even better. On the _OM-D E-M1 mk
iii_ (you still see images of the _mk ii_ on this blog),
there was already an improvement with much less color noise,
and in the images taken with the OM-1, I see practically
none.
