There is a term in the German language, called
_Putin-Versteher_, meaning, someone who claims to understand
Vladimir Putin, meaning, that one can see a logic in his
deeds. Of course, those who use it, use it derisively, in
the sense of, _has been manipulated_.

In a way, to a certain degree, I was a _Putin-Versteher_
myself. Basically, until the Russian invasion, I thoroughly
didn't expect it. It was impossible. What did he have to
win? In my understanding, the USA did try to provoke him
into ... not a war, but some kind of moderate but
nevertheless inexcusable transgression, in order to finally
force Europe to abandon the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and sell
us their expensive gas.

I still believe, that this was one of the major US goals,
that was it all the time, and without some weird stunt, it
would not have been preventable. Legally the pipeline was
completely OK, and more or less finished as well.

So, maybe a little suffering for the Ukraine would have been
perfectly acceptable. Something like the one-sided
recognition of those two new "People's Republics" would have
done, and indeed it was enough to push Germany over the
edge.

At that point I was still convinced, that Putin is a
rational actor. He would have lost some business, but what
the Germans don't buy, the Chinese invariably will. He would
stop at that exact line, because he also had achieved a
goal. He would have demonstrated will and ability, and that
would have helped him in Russia.

Still, both sides would know, that nothing really had
changed. Both would be able to live with it. After all, the
Russians had already been in Donbass. For the Ukraine, it
would be an embarrassment, but for the rest of the world? It
would have been a cynical win-win of the big gorillas.

And then all shattered. I have no idea what that means. Are
we back on the brink of nuclear war? Seriously? Has Putin
gone mad? And if so, what does that mean? Will he stop now?

So, now we have the inexcusable transgression, but much
worse: Putin has maneuvered us into a situation without an
acceptable exit path for anyone, himself included.

You see me worried.
