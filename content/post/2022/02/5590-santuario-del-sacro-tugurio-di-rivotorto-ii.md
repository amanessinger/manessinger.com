Hummm ... funny, I thought. This is one of those churches,
that have at their heart not the usual naves and altars, but
instead a house or, like in this case, a grave. It's always
something like "The House of the Virgin Mary" or "The
Original Grave of Christ", or something like that. 

I can't remember having seen this anywhere but in Italy.
There, it is not exactly frequent, but it's not unusual
either.
