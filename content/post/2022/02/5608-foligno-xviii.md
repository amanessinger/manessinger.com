Wikipedia says, "_The Giostra della Quintana was a
historical jousting tournament in Foligno, central Italy. It
was revived as a modern festival in 1946. The tournament
event takes place in June (1st Challenge) during a Saturday
night and September (the counter-challenge) the 2nd or 3rd
Sunday of September, and is proceeded each time by a
festival with a 17th-century costumed parade._"

The festival must have been at or around the time when we
were there. Explains all the flags and the decorations.
