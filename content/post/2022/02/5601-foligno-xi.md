My birthday is approaching. Nothing special, just a 58, but
just now, OM Systems, the company, that bought
Olympus' camera business, has released a new camera. It's
called the OM-1, which is fine, much better than _OM-D E-M1 mk iv_.

I own a lot of Olympus glass, some expensive, some cheap,
so, I probably would have bought it anyway, if only to
extend the relevance of my lenses.

Some people hoped for more than 20 Megapixels, some for
extended dynamic range, turned out it was only dynamic
range.

I don't care. What I really care about, is the electronic
viewfinder. Basically they've doubled the pixels, giving it
1.4 times the linear resolution, and that's fine. I'd have
been delighted by less, so this is a welcome surprise.

Other than that, the camera seems to use its 20 Megapixel
advantage to greatly increase speed. 120 frames per second?
Insane. I have no use for that, but it's good to see
progress anyway :smile:
