Interesting. I can't remember anything of Madonna delle
Lacrime's cloister, but what you see in this picture. It
could be a fragment, it could have been full of people, it
could have hosted an exhibition blocking the other views, or
it could have been just extraordinarily boring. I have no
idea. I do like this image though.
