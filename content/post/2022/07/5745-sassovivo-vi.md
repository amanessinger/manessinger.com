Frequently, especially in older monasteries, cloisters were
used to grow herbs, i.e. for practical purposes. It would be
interesting to know if that was the case here as well.
Sassovivo in fact is old. The cloister was finished in 1229,
and the well was added in 1623. I can't know, but I suspect,
that's when they added the pavement.
