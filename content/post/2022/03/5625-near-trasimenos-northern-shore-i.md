Almost three weeks into the Ukrainian nightmare. I seem to
get used to it. What else can you do?

Truth? Who knows. There is a documentary about Donbass, made
by a French journalist, Anne-Laure Bonnel, whose work is
currently used by right-wing sympathizers of the Russian
aggression. Basically, she went to Donbass in 2016, and she
talked to people, Russian speakers, under the attack of
Ukrainian artillery. So, that's what Putin means by genocide
against ethnic Russians.

You can view it on YouTube. It's in French, but subtitles in
a few languages are available, English among them.

Truth? Is that how it began? Ukrainians shelling Russians on
their own territory? Ethnic cleansing? Is that it?

I forgot how it all began, and I doubt that it could have
been clarified, at a time when it was not yet in focus of
people like me.

Wikipedia's [War in
Donbass](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Donbas) page
roots the conflict in 2014, when the Maidan protests, the
Orange Revolution, toppled the elected government.

I remember that time. There were a lot of concerning things,
and the protagonists of the protests looked much like
irresponsible adventure-seekers. Was that the truth?

One of the most interesting actors in Ukraine was [Yulia
Tymoshenko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Tymoshenko).
I remember her as charismatic, but in a disturbing way
radical and deeply divisive. Well, and that was before I
looked into the Wikipedia page. Look for yourself: what can
you learn? Was her influence positive? Did it directly lead
to the current situation? Did she act responsible or was she
reckless? Honest or corrupt? Perpetrator or victim? I can't
tell.

History is a mess. Blaming other people always succeeds,
because there is always something unjust in the past, and
never ever is every wrong made right. The very question of
how that all did start is wrong. In reality nothing ever
really started. Everything developed from something that
already was, and in an imperfect world, in every phase along
the way, someone took advantage of someone else, creating a
reason for future hate.
