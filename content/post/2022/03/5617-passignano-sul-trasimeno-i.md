What a terrible mess this world is!

I've looked up some places on Street View, that recently
were shelled by russian artillery. Among them were beaches
along the Dnjepr in Kiev and much further south, along the
sea. 

You see cars, people, restaurants, well, just like in this
image. That's what it should be.

And then you see the aftermath, and you think about it, that
normal people, people without power to change the course of
the world, without even a voice, get killed, lose their
beloved, their belongings, their communities, their world.

And why?

Because an old, solitary man with too much power, and too
much ego, and not any empathy at all, confuses the world
with his personal enemy.
