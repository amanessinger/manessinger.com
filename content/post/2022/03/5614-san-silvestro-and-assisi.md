San Silvestro is a beautiful, walled village with one or two
churches and a monastery. It is also one of those places,
that wants to turn you away. You drive along the wall, from
one exit to the next. 

I'm sure, somewhere outside the wall is a big parking area,
but it was already late, we've had a long day and seen a
lot. Normally we are more persistent, but in this case we
gave up.

The image was taken from a small hill south-east of San
Silvestro, and behind it, you see Assisi.
