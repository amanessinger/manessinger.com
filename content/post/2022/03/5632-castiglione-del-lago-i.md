Castiglione del Lago is a small town on a peninsula reaching
into Trasimeno from the west. Here we stand, near the
western gate, looking west across the modern town.

By the way, in the meantime I've got my new OM-1 and the
100-400/5.0-6.3. This is the first Olympus camera without
dedicated battery charger. I've ordered one dual-charger and
two batteries, but they are not available yet, so it's a
single battery and USB charging.

The camera itself is mostly like the OM-D E-M1 iii, with a
few goodies thrown in:

* both SD card slots take UHS-II cards now
* the menu system is easier and quicker to navigate
* slightly higher dynamic range and faster speed
* better autofocus
* everything I forgot :grin:

The lens is ... hard to use. I really need to practice :blush:

Yesterday I was at the zoo. Elephants were no problem, birds
were hit-and-miss, and small apes escaped me completely. I
have to say though, that I still feel very insecure with
continuous autofocus and focus-following, along with the
size and shape of the active focus area. Quite a lot of
permutations to play through.

As for the battery: after 160 exposures and checking almost
every exposure, I was well above 50%. I certainly can live
with that for some weeks.
