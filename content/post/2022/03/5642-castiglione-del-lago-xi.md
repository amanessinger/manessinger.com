A tiny chapel on Castiglione's "High Street". I can't find
it on Google Maps, and I can't give you its name.

I'm not sure what version of this image you see. I've
processed, uploaded, re-processed and re-uploaded it
multiple times, and for some weird reason, the 150px size of
the thumbnail on the index page and the 600px size embedded
into the post seem to stick to the first version, that was
much too yellow. It's not browser chaching, it's some kind
of persistent caching in the Amazon cloud, and of always
three sizes uploaded at the same time, two never refresh. Oh
well! 

Please click into the image for a 1200px rendition. That's
what I'm going to talk about below.

White-balancing is sorta challenging. I can't remember on
which side of the street the chapel was, on the sunny side,
or in the shade. In any case, the interior was extremely
dim.

What you see, is an effort of masking, dodging and
color-correcting the door frame, and of bringing everything
in a believable balance. It is **not what I saw**, but I
think it is close to the best possible interpretation of
what the camera recorded. It's my third or fourth attempt,
and definitely my final :grin:
