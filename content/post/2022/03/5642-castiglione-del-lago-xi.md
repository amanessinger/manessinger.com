A tiny chapel on Castiglione's "High Street". I can't find
it on Google Maps, and I can't give you its name.

White-balancing is sorta challenging. I can't remember on
which side of the street the chapel was, on the sunny side,
or in the shade. In any case, the interior was extremely
dim.

What you see, is an effort of masking, dodging and
color-correcting the door frame, and of bringing everything
in a believable balance. It is **not what I saw**, but I
think it is close to the best possible interpretation of
what the camera recorded. It's my third or fourth attempt,
and definitely my final :grin:
