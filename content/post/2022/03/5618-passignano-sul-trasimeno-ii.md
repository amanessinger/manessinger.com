I like what [Yanis
Varoufakis](https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/2022/03/05/what-we-must-in-the-face-of-putins-criminal-invasion-of-ukraine-a-personal-view-plus-a-heartwarming-manifesto-by-russian-comrades/)
has written about the conflict. The gist is, you may not
agree with the economic course of the government of Ukraine,
and there may really be a few Nazis in the Ukraine, and
there may really have been some discrimination against
Russians, and there may really be a racist discrimination
between brown and white victims, but, at this point, there
can be no discussion. At this point, Putin has forced us, to
unconditionally stand with Ukraine.

Putin has solved not a single problem. Not for himself, not
for Russia, not for the world. He has only created a
gigantic new one. Great job!
