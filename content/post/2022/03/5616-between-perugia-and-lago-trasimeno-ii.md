Lago Trasimeno. The name may sound familiar. Somewhere north
of the lake, nobody knows exactly where, was the site of a
famous battle between Hannibal and the Romans. 217 B.C.
Quite a long while ago. Hannibal won, but in the end,
Carthage fell anyway.

Here we are in the gentle hills between Perugia and the lake.
