If all went well, two days ago from when this post is
published, I should already have my new OM-1 camera, plus an
[M.Zuiko ED 100-400mm F5.0-6.3
IS](https://www.imaging-resource.com/lenses/olympus/100-400mm-f5-6.3-is-m.zuiko-digital-ed/review/).

Why such a long lens, you ask? Well, I haven't had such a
range ever. I plan to use three lenses for my next longer
trip: the 7-14/2.8, the 12-100/4 and this 100-400/5-6.3.
That's an equivalent of 14-800 mm. Who knows, I may find
that too heavy, but then, I may like it.

I expect to still use the 12-100 for the bulk of my imagery,
but just as you sometimes need a shorter lens, there's a
universe of imaging opportunities beyond 100 mm. And, as
always, at my current pace of using images on my blog,
you'll see them in a few years :grin:
