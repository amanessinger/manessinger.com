The question is not, how did it start, the question is, how
can we stop it? In order to answer this question, we must
not look into the past. Only bitterness is there, and
longing for a past that cannot be repeated.

In my opinion, it is not a question of whether Putin wins or
to what degree he must be punished for his aggression. It's
not about Putin, and it's not about Biden, and it's not
about Macron, and least of all it is about that moron
ruining the UK.

It's about people bleeding and dying in the Ukraine, and
it's about the reality of a conflict that has never been
solved and, q.e.d., can't be solved belligerently.

In my opinion, the only viable way out there is neutrality
of the country, because with its mixed and intermingled
populations and their different interests, any kind of
taking sides will create victors and victims. 

Neutrality is one of the Russians' demands, and giving in to
it may seem like a loss, but what is neutrality but the
absence of taking sides in conflicts? The absence of war?
Austria enjoys a neutrality forced upon us after World War
II. The neutrality of Finland and Sweden has similar
reasons, and look at Switzerland: didn't neutrality benefit
them?
