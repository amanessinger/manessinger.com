Two days ago, we have established, that the Austrian health
system would begin to break down, if more than 700 people
were in intensive care for Covid-19 at the same time. Let's
say 900, then we are at 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of the
population. Can you begin to see, why lots of people don't
believe in the danger, effectively don't care?

There are some American numbers on the site of the [US Census
Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/05/america-a-nation-of-small-towns.html).
About 76% of the approximately 19,500 incorporated places
had fewer than 5,000 people. Of those, almost 42% had fewer
than 500 people. That does not mean 76% of the people though. 

In another article on
[newgeography.com](https://www.newgeography.com/content/00242-america-more-small-town-we-think),
they quote the average small town population as 6200. Again,
this does not exactly match up, because they call everything
up to 25,000 a "small town". 

Let's combine the two figures, make it 10,000 incorporated
places with an average of 2000 people. This is guaranteed to
be wrong, but likely not by a magnitude. We are then at a
sum of 20,000,000 population, roughly 1/16<sup>th</sup> of
the US population.

All of those people live in communities, where it takes on
average five of those places, to find a single person in
intensive care because of Covid-19. Again, roughly, this is
in the ballpark of a third of the US population. And even if
my estimate were pretty far off, lets say it were only a tenth
of the US population, we would still talk about 33 million
people, who can say with confidence, that they don't
know anyone afflicted.

Do you wonder about Covid denial? I don't.

The result is a tragedy.
