Again, a city on a hill :smile:

I had troubles finding the exact location on Street View.
The reason is, that the image is a detail, and in context,
this place [looks very
different](https://goo.gl/maps/nzswt2kSWU6vpZ2C7). I found
it, because I could read the street sign on the wall in the
background, behind the group of tourists. It reads
"Piazzetta di S.Francesco Piccolino". The passage goes down
to a tiny church, and now that I know [what it looks
like](https://goo.gl/maps/eS2sD15bjnrLmHyX8), I regret not
having gone down the few steps.
