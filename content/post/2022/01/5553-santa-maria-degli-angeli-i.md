2022? I've got barely used to 21 until recently :stuck_out_tongue:

Glad you've arrived! We've closed 2021 with a night image
from Perugia. A few days before, we had looked towards
Assisi, and that's where we're headed now.

Assisi lies majestically on a hill, and at its feet lies the
small town Santa Maria degli Angeli, named after the grand
basilica constructed between 1569 and 1679.
