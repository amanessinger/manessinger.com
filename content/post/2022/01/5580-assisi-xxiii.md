San Francesco is _the_ main reason why people come here. I
get it, it's a religious site. People come here to pray, and
they don't want to be bothered by photographers. On the
other hand, there are guided tours, so, I don't really get,
why in so many of the _premium_ churches in the world,
photography is forbidden. It also happened last year in the
legendary Certosa di Pavia.

I would happily pay any reasonable fee (for a very loose
definition of reason), just for having a photo permit. Using
electronic shutter mode, my camera can be absolutely silent,
and with stabilization, I need neither flash nor tripod. Oh
my!
