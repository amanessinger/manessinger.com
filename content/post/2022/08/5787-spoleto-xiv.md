Hmmm ... at this time I should have arrived in Strasbourg,
France, one of the seats of the European Parliament. The
photo you see is three years old. In my mind, it is more
present than much of what came in between. 2020 and 2021
were the years of the pandemic, and 2022 ... is the year of
catastrophes and war.

I can't tell you when you'll see the images of Strasbourg.
It won't take another three years though, that's for sure. I
have not taken many images the last years, not to mention
this year.

And one time I will die. With a cache of a few years of
unprocessed images. It's a strange and unsatisfying thought,
although, once it will have come to be, nobody will care
less than I :grin:

Still, we strive for eternity. Leaving things unfinished
feels wrong. Btw, this is not an actual problem, just a
weird thought for now.
