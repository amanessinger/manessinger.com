Here's a stitched panorama of three images below the
half-cupola yesterday. There are distortions, I should and
probably could have done a much better job in Photoshop, the
right side is of really, bad quality, but I'll show it
nevertheless :smile:

If you wanted to do that, you'd transform the individual
images before stitching. The problem is, the images were
neither taken from the same point nor from the same angle.
Each has a different kind of perspective distortion,
therefore you can't correct the whole image in one. Anyway,
I didn't do it, I just fixed the verticals in Lightroom.
