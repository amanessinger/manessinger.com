Uhh, funny! How could I mistake it? THIS is the image on my
phone, the image on my tablet, not the other one. 

Sometimes I almost feel bad about an image that works.
This is one of these images. It's perfect, not because I've
taken it, it's perfect, although I've taken it. I didn't
contribute anything. And that, on the other hand, is the
attraction: The image transcends my abilities by far. It's a
rare glimpse of the divine.
