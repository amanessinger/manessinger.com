Do you dream bad dreams lately? We live in extraordinary
times. Until late february, I wouldn't have thought that, if
I write more than a weeks posts ahead (like I do now), the
world might end before my words get posted.

If I remember well, some days in the Eighties had similar
vibes. Then it was Ronald Reagan rattling the saber, and
much later, [it turned out to have been
close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov). I
didn't like the feeling then, and I much less like it now.
