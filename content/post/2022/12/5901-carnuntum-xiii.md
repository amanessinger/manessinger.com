Floor heating today is a thin layer of meandering plastic
pipes below tiles or parquet. This is the Roman version of
floor heating. Similar to today's floors in computing
centers, but instead of hiding cables, hot air was led
through here.

It took almost 1500 years after the end of the Roman empire,
for anything comparable to emerge.
