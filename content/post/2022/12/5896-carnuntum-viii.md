Compared to modern architecture, Romans built with very
small windows. It was a matter of keeping the warmth in. We
know, the Romans had central heating, and we will see an
example, but of course this was only available to wealthy
people. Even they could not enjoy big windows. The
technology for thermally isolated window panes was simply
not available - and it wouldn't be for almost 2000 years.
