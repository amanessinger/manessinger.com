A workshop? Can't remember. Fact is, not everything was
built from stone. Actually it's interesting, that they built
so much from stone in a region with so much wood. Carnuntum
is near Vienna, and nowadays everything around Vienna is
agriculturally used, but in Roman times, much of Europe was
almost unpopulated forest.
