You may remember [The church of
Velden](https://blog.andreas-manessinger.info/2021/10/5483-the-church-of-velden-i.html).
Back from Italy, we start with another church built in the
time between the two World Wars. The church of Bodensdorf
was built in 1929. The architect was [Hans
Prutscher](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Prutscher).
Incidentally he worked on quite a few buildings in Vienna,
among them the monastery in Kaiserstra√üe, on the other side
of the street from where I lived for 27 years :grin:
