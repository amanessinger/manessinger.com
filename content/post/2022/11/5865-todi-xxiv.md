Quite a problematic image, because of the insane contrast.
It took local adjustments in both DxO and Lightroom, to keep
color and contrast under control. I'm quite satisfied with
the result, given that out-of-camera, the window was an
explosion of bluish light, and the altar was mostly a black
blob :grin:
