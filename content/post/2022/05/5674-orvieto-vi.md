Telling stories by putting episodes on branches of a tree
was quite common in those times. Those times?
14<sup>th</sup> century. If you've read Barbara Tuchman's [A
Distant
Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Distant_Mirror), you
know that this was a time of turmoil and calamity. Just
think of the great Black Plague in 1348! 

That's about the time when the great Andrea Pisano built the
rose window. Times of turmoil often are times of great
creativity.
