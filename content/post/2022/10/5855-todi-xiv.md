We had entered the church on the left side, where the
entrance is almost even. That's what it looks like, when you
leave on the right side.

Contrast in this image is brutal, but DxO handled noise,
detail and distortions marvelously. I don't use it all the
time, but when I do, I'm always pleased. Not that it makes
much of a difference here on the web, but looking at pixels,
the difference is always present.
