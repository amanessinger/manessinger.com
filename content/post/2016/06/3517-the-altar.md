It was that time of the year again, Easter, and as every year we had a look at some of Carinthia's Lenten veils. In the past two years I've shown some of the oldest, this year we have two modern ones, created by Valentin Oman, a carinthian painter of considerable fame.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160319_133622_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160319_133622_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The church here, as in the last two posts, by the way, is in Eisenkappel/Å½elezna Kapla, a small town in south-east Carinthia. Not only is the veil by Oman, so are the windows.

We were there more or less around noon. The strong sunlight coming through the blue and yellow windows created something of a white-balancing nightmare. These two images are the fruit of my struggle. Especially the last one was pure horror, because the inner portal from anteroom into nave was naturally lit from outside, overly bright and of completely different color temperature.

In the end I can say that these images don't look like it did when I was there. They look better. Much better ðŸ™‚

I suppose the right time to visit this church for an image of the veil is the evening. At that time the altar will be lit and the veil must really glow in bright colors. As it was, in that mix of colored light through the windows, the veil looked pale and more like dirty canvas ðŸ˜„

By the way, all processing was done in Lightroom only.
