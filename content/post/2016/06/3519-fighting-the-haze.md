There is nothing particularly interesting in this image. It was taken on our way back from Eisenkappel. 

I've used the Olympus 40-150/2.8 at its longest, and like in so many long-distance shots the colors were distorted by haze. Not only that, they had also suffered much more in the far-away background of the image. Hey, I thought, what better image to try out Lightroom's new "Local Dehaze" feature. 

Of course this is much more useful than a global dehaze, because normally haze comes exactly like in this image: vastly different for different distances.

There is no overlapping foreground, and so I was not forced to do any complicated mask painting. A simple gradient from top to bottom did the trick. As far as I remember, I have used "Dehaze", a slight shift to a warmer color temperature and maybe not much more. It was really easy.
