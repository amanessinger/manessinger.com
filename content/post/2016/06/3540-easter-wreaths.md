On Sunday I have returned from Aix-en-Provence after a hot and sunny week.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160327_101930_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160327_101930_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Sunday evening we were sill able to dine on the terrace, but already dark storm clouds loomed in the west.

I still have a week in Carinthia and I would have hoped for better weather ðŸ™‚

The images are from my trip to Schloss Hof shortly after Easter. At least here we have plenty of vivid colors.
