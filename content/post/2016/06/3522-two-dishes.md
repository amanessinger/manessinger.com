I love strange angles on familiar things. This house in Villach obviously lacks a shared satellite infrastructure as well as cable TV. 

Well, access to trash shows is a human right and a prime desire, therefore nobody dares to regulate the number of dishes you can put on a house. And besides, regulations are communist and communism is evil ðŸ™‚
