It's interesting how modern architecture takes up patterns of ancient one, although it may not always make sense. But then, this residential building is in a street with two bordellos, so maybe they have reason to defend themselves ðŸ™‚

The blinds on the window in the upper right corner are still battered by last years hail. And while we look at the windows: Notice how they get ever narrower from right to left. This is a typical case of mindless "Form follows an Architect's Whim". I'm sure the people living on the left side would agree. I admit though that it look cool.
