Rotten Flesh? Harsh words. I may have to explain.

We had roughly 50% of votes for Norbert Hofer. That are about 2.2 million people. Those are not the neo-Nazis I mean. The vast majority of them are also not idiots. 

Those are the people unsatisfied with the political system and its pseudo-choices that always boil down to the same politics and to the same sorry results. Those are people in fear for their jobs and of their economic future. Those are people in fear of the competition of immigrants. Those are people who clamor for real change. Unfortunately they also want simple solutions where none exist. That makes them susceptible to the liers, the vendors of snake oil, the populists.

Did the Freedom Party appeal? No, of course not. They had no case and they knew it.

Did they apologize for planting rumors? No, of course not.

Did they at least stop the rumors? No, of course not.

And here we are again: Rotten Flesh!
