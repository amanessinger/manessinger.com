The images of the next three weeks were all made on a single one day trip to <a href="https://www.schlosshof.at/" target="_blank">Schloss Hof</a>, a castle or more of a palace that once belonged to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy" target="_blank">Prince Eugene of Savoy</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160327_095808_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160327_095808_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Rejected by Louis XIV for service in the French army, he moved to Austria and became the Habsburg Monarchy's most successful general in their war against the Turks on the Balkans, in northern Italy and where else Austria cared to meddle.

These two images were taken in the morning on my way to the castle.
