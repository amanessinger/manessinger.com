Another effect of not only using images shot on the same day is, that I make a lot of images on a good day and so I can actually use them, thereby compensating for the bad or otherwise busy days. Processing and posting images on the same day would severly limit the maximum number of good images used. 

You may remember from earlier years that I had often used five or even six images in one post. Since I switched to Lightroom as my main processing tool, it is easier and I'm much faster than with Photoshop, but still, just thinking about six images takes a lot of time. Time that I don't have or don't want to spare.
