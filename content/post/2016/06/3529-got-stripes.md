Colors in this image are approximate at best. Processing it, I found out that it looked odd, maybe too green, but "correcting" it made it only worse. In such cases I either go for B&amp;W (would have been a valid option here), or I just stop worrying and do what looks best, regardless of what it was in reality. 

Of course it helps if you don't take images of people. Color-wise architecture is much more forgiving than faces ðŸ™‚
