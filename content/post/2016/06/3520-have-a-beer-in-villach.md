Globalization takes its toll. At one time we had a lot of small, local breweries in Carinthia. Then, during my childhood, all of them but three vanished. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160320_140318_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160320_140318_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In my late youth "Hirter Bier", the smallest of the three, became something like a local cult, and "Schleppe", the one in my hometown Klagenfurt, was bought by its competitor in Villach. "Villacher", along with almost every other big brewery in Austria belongs with 50% to "Brau Union AG", which was bought bei "Heineken". And now we've finally arrived at a name that you know ðŸ™‚
