It's strange to see old images like this. At the moment I'm almost three months behind, so this is an image from mid-March. The advantage is, that I see those images much more often than in those years ago when I had taken, processed and blogged an image on the same day. Not only is it more relaxing, but it also gives me the opportunity to see images anew and sometimes revise my judgement.

This particular image had to be cropped. When I took it, I did not plan to include a person. The man just happened to walk into my composition. Cropping it gave the walker a more dynamic position, and in the end the result is much better than the original composition had been. I like it.
