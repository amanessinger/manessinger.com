Villach is a small town or, as I like to say, a right-sized town. There are no high-rise buildings, public transport lacks severely, but you don't need it that much anyway.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160320_141901_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160320_141901_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Basically you can cross the town in an hour and a half by foot. I rarely do that, because the outskirts are much better suited to cars than to pedestrian, but from time to time I love to criss-cross the central part, strolling around, hunting for pictures. It has not the density of possible subjects that Vienna's center has, but you just have to look for different things.
