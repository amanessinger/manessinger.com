The E-P5 in silver is a remarkably beautiful camera and the 75/1.8 in silver is a remarkably beautiful lens. Perfect match ðŸ™‚

The lens is already a little bit on the heahy side for a PEN. It's still quite balanced, but anything longer and heavier would feel awkward.

What's not to like, I asked yesterday. There's only one Fn-button. Thus I have one programmable button less than on the OM-D E-M1. It does not have the on/off switch on the left side, like on the E-M1 and the PEN-F. At first I found it a bad idea (and it likely is), but once you're used to it, consistency is more important than ultimate usability. 

Finally the firmware didn't get one convenient update that the E-M1 got: the stickiness of menu position. On the E-M1 the camera remembers where I was when I last changed something in the deep menu. On the E-P5 it doesn't. I can live with both ways perfectly, but it's still irritating when I switch cameras. And of course it's unnecessary as well. Hmm ... I probably should switch it off on the E-M1, but it was a feature I've always wished for, a feature that made me happy when I got it.

OK, that's it. During the last three months I've almost exclusively used the E-P5 in Vienna, almost always with primes, and the E-M1 in Carinthia and in Provence, almost always with the PRO zooms.
