Here's another image made with the cheap and lowly Olympus M.Zuiko 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 R, also known as "The Plastic Lens". It even has a plastic mount. The glass is OK though. Wide open (which is not wide at all) it is not comparable to the 40-15/2.8 PRO, but like here, at f10, you won't see that much of a difference. Give it some light and it shines.
