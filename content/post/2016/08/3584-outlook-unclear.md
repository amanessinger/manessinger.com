How can a democracy possibly handle a series of terrorist attacks? Is there any way to keep civilized? Is it inevitable to spiral down into violence? Is violence a force like entropy? Something that you can't escape in the long run?

Well, one thing seems clear to me: in order to stop violence in the long run, we need to stop meddling with other people's countries. We need to stop making wars in other people's countries. We need to stop profiting from such wars. We need to stop depending on such wars for our own economic advantage.

The tragic truth is though, we didn't. We didn't even try to. We may begin to, but I'm afraid it's a little late now. Not that it wouldn't be a good idea anyway, but there's already so much damage done, that it is hard to imagine how we could escape the consequences of our doings while still behaving like decent human beings. Hell, even if we embraced barbarianism instead, it is hard to imagine how we could get away unscathed. Any ideas out there?
