I don't do HDR very often. I used to do it in the past, but frequently it seems too much hassle. Dynamic range of digital cameras has become so good, that it rarely is necessary any more.

And there are exceptions ðŸ™‚

This image is one. No way I could have got both clean grass and that much detail in the sky in one exposure. I can't remember whether I had to clone out a reflection of the sun in the lower right part, but I suspect I did ...

... no, I've just looked up the original exposures, and there is really no trace of a reflection. Amazing how good those Olympus lenses are on Olympus bodies. I have no idea how well they do on Panasonic bodies, but I've always had trouble with extensive flares when using Panasonic lenses on Olympus bodies. Must be some incompatibility of sensor reflectivity and lens coating.
