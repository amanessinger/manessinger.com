April 28. We've had snow that late in earlier years. Well, I can remember at least two occasions, one was even in early May. Never before was it that much though.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160428_072317_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160428_072317_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> We had already brought most of the plants out, and it was arranged that in a few days the protective nets for the cats would be strengthened, in order to better survive next winter. They had suffered a little, even though we'd had an exceptionally mild winter.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160429_165934_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160429_165934_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, and then 15&nbsp;cm of that wet, heavy slush fell down on us in a single day. It was even more in Klagenfurt, around 20&nbsp;cm, and friends from Rosental, the valley where we lived for 20 years, told us a story of 40&nbsp;cm of snow and almost two days without electricity.
