Here's another image I wouldn't want to print. I've already taken back the reds, but still the car is almost out of gamut.

By the way, for ten years I've driven a succession of three of those CitroÃ«n 2CV. Fabulous car. I wouldn't want to have an accident in it, it's slow on the highway, in winter it takes two hours of driving until you stop feeling cold, but I love the canvas top, the quirky way you shift gears, the beautiful headlights and the way you open the side windows by folding the lower part up. It's pure nostalgia.
