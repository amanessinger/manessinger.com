OK, back from yesterday's pessimistic mood ðŸ™‚

This is one of the trees that I see very often. Sometimes I see a scene like this, sometimes I don't, and sometimes when I do, I lack a long enough lens. It's 62&nbsp;mm, almost the wide end on this cheap plastic zoom, but still, in order to get this frame, 45&nbsp;mm would have been too wide, 75&nbsp;mm (the other long prime that I frequently carry) would have been too tight. In this particular case the macro would have been perfect, but as I never carry more than one long lens, I wouldn't have been able to make yesterday's image.

Sometimes slow but light zooms are sweet ðŸ™‚
