Every once in a while I come back to the region where I lived for 20 years. It's halfway between Klagenfurt, the city where I was born, and Villach, the city where I live now. It's not on a direct line, but on the northern side of a valley parallel to that line.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160417_115924_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160417_115924_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I've taken a few images along that creek. It runs along one of the many ravines that go down to river Drau. Most of them are off the street and you won't notice them if you don't know them. This one is an exception, because a small road down into the valley follows it for a while.
