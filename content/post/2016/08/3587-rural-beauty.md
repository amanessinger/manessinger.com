A spring meadow with flowers and blossoming trees, the shot taken low and with blurred flowers in the lower foreground, well, that's kind of a classic. You could also say that it's a clichÃ©, but I don't care and allow myself the luxury of a few such images per year ðŸ™‚

Looks nice, huh? Incredibly rural, far from the madding crowd?

Nope, it's halfway between a busy street, leading into Villach from the south, and our apartment complex, basically a hundred meters in each direction. I love living in a small town ðŸ˜„
