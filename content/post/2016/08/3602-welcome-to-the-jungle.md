We've had this shopping center in Villach a few times, I guess. I like the decoration made of real plants growing up the columns, and I also like the strange effect of the curved, mirrored surfaces. Add a few blossoms and you can imagine being in the jungle on an alien planet. Ok, maybe you can't, but I can for sure ðŸ˜„
