The 60/2.8 is by no means a long lens, but it is long enough to start playing tricks with compression. Here I've used f9 to get as much even sharpness as possible. The result is nicely confusing ðŸ™‚

Along with that, the image is also a good example for why I so often don't need shallow DOF at all. More often than not the opposite is true.
