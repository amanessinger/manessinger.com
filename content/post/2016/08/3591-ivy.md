I see, I see: this was "Cheap Week" ðŸ™‚

The Image of the Day was made with another cheap and light lens, the collapsible pancake lens <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/lenses/panasonic/12-32mm-f3.5-5.6-asph-mega-ois-lumix-g-vario/review/" target="_blank">Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-32mm 3.5-5.6 ASPH</a>. You have to admit, this is pretty much of a name for such a small and light piece of almost nothing ðŸ˜„

I rarely use it nowadays, but really, it is a lens good enough for a trip to sunny places. I certainly could have used it in Lisbon for most of the images made with the much more expensive, much bigger and much heavier 12-40/2.8 PRO. The collapsing mechanism is something that I need to get used to, but after an hour it feels natural enough.

This small zoom, the plastic 40-150, and probably the Olympus 9-18 if I need it real wide, that's probably as light as it gets. Occasionally I may have to raise ISO to 1600 or even 3200, but then I can always process with DxO. Oh yes, and: you won't shoot action with that combo. The cheap 40-150 focuses abysmally slow. For my kind of images it doesn't matter though. My subjects rarely move.
