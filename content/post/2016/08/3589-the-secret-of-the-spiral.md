Do you also like this kind of images? Exotic spiral staircases? I certainly do. You see a real lot of them on Flickr and elsewhere, and I have always wondered how people find so many of them.

Well, I suppose I know now. I've always looked in public places for big spiral staircases. Of course the few that I found were always full of people. Recently I discovered this one, and suddenly it all became clear: they are tiny and narrow! They are not in big public buildings, they are in private houses. 

It doesn't mean that I'll suddenly find more of them, but it means I can stop looking in the wrong places ðŸ™‚
