I'm afraid I don't know which of the many churches and chapels this is. I delayed tagging the images until it was too late. I suppose I could find it on Street View, but I'm on the train now and my connection is flaky. Having an LTE plan is one thing, having LTE is another ðŸ™‚

... some time passes ...

No, I've tried just that, I've walked the streets of Aix, I know the part of the city where it should be, but obviously I have made a shortcut or a deviation somewhere that I've forgotten. 

I have made a non-distinct image a minute before, and the next images came only 15 minutes later. 15 minutes are a long time. Even one of them is, as we've learned in Yellow Submarine ðŸ˜„
