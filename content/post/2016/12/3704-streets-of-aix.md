There are "Sights" and there are sights. Today it's about those lower case moments when you walk along the streets of a city and just feel the urge to take a photo.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160625_174756_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160625_174756_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's the mode of seeing that you are in when you are on home turf. You don't try to depict a characteristic view of a place that you likely won't return to, you try to depict the feeling of being where you are, regardless of where that is.

Whenever I am on vacation, I try to get a fair mix of the two. "Sights" are what you came for, sights are what let's you feel relaxed. Skip them and you haven't been there.
