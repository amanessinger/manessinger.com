This is the last image from Novo Mesto. If you've followed my recommendation yesterday and looked at the <a href="http://www.google.at/search?q=novo+mesto&tbm=isch" target="_blank">Google image search</a>, you may ask yourself why I have not taken any images that are more "spectacular".

Well, the problem is, the best look on Novo Mesto is from high above. The spectacular thing is, how this town is embraced by the river, but in order to see that, you'd have to fly. A drone would probably do the trick, but maybe it really needs and airplane. I had neither, therefore I saw it mostly as another small town with two churches, a river and a bridge. Nice, but ultimately not as outstanding as I had expected it to be.
