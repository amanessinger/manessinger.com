The Gorges du Verdon, the canyon of the Verdon river, is frequently called the Grand Canyon of Provence.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160623_142536_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160623_142536_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's big though. We originally planned to drive along the southern side, cross somewhere far into the valley at the first bridge, and then return along the northern side.

We didn't. It would have taken a few hours, and I had the feeling that it would have been much, much more of the same. For an impression it was enough.

It's one of those countless "maybe next time" things that tend to never happen. 

The world is a big place ðŸ™‚
