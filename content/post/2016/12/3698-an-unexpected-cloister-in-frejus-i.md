<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9jus" target="_blank">Fréjus</a> had not been on my radar. If you had asked me where that place is, I would have said it's in the French Alps, just across the border from Torino, Italy. Which is also correct, because the mountain pass pass leading from Torino to France is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_du_Fr%C3%A9jus" target="_blank">Col du Fréjus</a>, and that's the name that I had in mind.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160624_115740_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160624_115740_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's always irritating when two places have the same name. I don't know the origin of the name of the mountain pass, but the city in Provence derives its name from Forum Julii. It's one of the cities founded by Julius Caesar. From there, linguistically, it's a long way to Fréjus, but that's what 2000 years do to names.

It's not a particularly interesting city, not a must-see in Provence, but it was one of the places where we could reach the sea. Cannes, half an hour on the highway to the east, would have been the next access to the Mediterranean, but we didn't want to drive that far. We just wanted to drive an hour or two along the coast and probably sip a drink somewhere. Therefore Fréjus was it.
