In earlier times I would have had bought a guide to the region, or more likely a few. I'm mostly interested in art, history and architecture, and the quality of guides varying.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160624_115834_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160624_115834_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Today I always start with a look into Wikipedia, and in order to be independent of Internet connections, I also have an offline copy of the German Wikipedia on my phone.

Basically the quality of that information is comparable to everything that a good tourist guide of the Provence would have revealed about a town like Fréjus. It told me that there is a cathedral, and it also told me about a cloister. I love cloisters, therefore we had to see it.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160624_120142_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160624_120142_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's a two story cloister. It's not a big one, but it is extremely beautiful.

What makes a cloister beautiful? Well, twin columns are always nice, and of course much depends on the nature of the patio. This one has a lovely well, white gravel and a few small trees. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160624_120617_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160624_120617_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Fréjus is not a tourist center. We spent maybe 20 minutes in the cloister and for the whole time we were completely alone. That's one of the benefits of visiting places off the beaten path.

It's not completely uncommon, but most of the time you have gothic or romanesque vaults. 

Originally the cloister was connected to the church, but that door is closed now. You reach thr cloister through the tourist office, just like we've seen it in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume.
