I've got no images from the whole drive along the coast. Basically it's a mix of tourist places and private houses all along the coast up to Saint-Tropez.

Thirty years ago I've been in Provence with a group of students. We've traveled by bus, and I remember having been in Saint-Tropez, or rather, I remember having driven through Saint-Tropez. Basically I remember one specific street corner, nothing more, but when we were there this year, everything looked completely new to me.

Which is good, because in my memory Saint-Tropez had been a let-down, and that's definitely not what it is. It actually has a picturesque center of narrow old streets, and that's probably also the reason why I can't remember it: it would have been completely unaccessible for a tourist bus ðŸ™‚

The image has been taken under the marquee of a restaurant where we sat and sipped a drink. The cool trick there is, that they spray a mist of cool water from the marquee a few times a minute. That's cool luxury under the burning sun.
