You won't be entirely alone while taking photos of lavender.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160623_120904_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160623_120904_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Obviously lavender seems to entrance photographers to a degree that they become oblivious to the dangers of car traffic. That's the reason for these warning signs that I saw over and again.

Sometimes you'll see fields of poppies though. Believe me, they are not easier to process. I dare you to make them glow but not burn out. Happy processing ðŸ˜„

In Aix-an-Provence I bought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisson" target="_blank">calisson</a>, a typical regional kind of candy, and they have some lavender-flavored variants there. If you try them, make sure to not think of toilet cleaners, and then you may well like the taste. I certainly did.
