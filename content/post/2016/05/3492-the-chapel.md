Carinthia is a rural part of Austria with a nice mix of lakes, soft valleys and high mountains. This image has been taken in one of the more mountainous regions. The bit of snow on the roof of this small wooden chapel, along with the snow-capped mountain in the background even gives an impression of winter.
