This image has been taken in the same spot as yesterday's street light, just looking the other way a few seconds later. The building is on the square in front of a former railway station. It houses a post office that was much bigger once, and other than that there is not much. It's a place that might have been lively in the past, but now just looks shabby. Golden light and an angle help a bit though ðŸ™‚
