Villach is an interesting town. I grew up in Klagenfurt, 35 kilometers away, and Klagenfurt had very distinct quarters. There was a district around a hill on the north-western side, that was where the rich lived. South-west and east were much less noble, and the part where I lived was technically within Klagenfurt's borders, but practically considered countryside. 

Villach is different. It has smaller districts, and for instance the nobler resideces are scattered much more. One of the reasons is, that Villach is at the confluence of two rivers, at the cross of two railway lines and two major roads. Villach is cut in two by a meandering river Drau, and then once again by its railway lines. In effect, whenever you want from A to B, your first thought is "What bridge should I take?". Add to that a few hills and you have a varied geography made up of small and very different neighborhoods.

This is a noise barrier along the western railway line. Pink is not necessarily my color, but I enjoyed it in February ðŸ˜„
