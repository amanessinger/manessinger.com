OK, I admit, yesterday's post was a little longer than usual. We'll leep it short and sweet today.

Although this image was taken at base ISO, I've done pretty cruel things to it in order to make the reflection on the black polished facade more seamless. Basically I had to raise levels in the drak parts by a few stops. DxO Optics Pro's PRIME noise reduction did an excellent job to keep noise out of the picture.
