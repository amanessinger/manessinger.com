The text on this wall can be roughly translated as<blockquote>Glass may be fragile<br />but not so our<br />memory of the victims of<br />National-Socialist<br />violence!<br />No peace with<br />Facists<br /></blockquote>The funny thing is, that the leftist / anarchist writers use a common and at the same time controversial form of plural for fascists, a form generally used by proponents of political correctness, and also a form fiercly opposed by real fascists and generally everybody whom they could possibly subsume under that category. It is meant as a generalized plural encompassing both genders. I found this more than mildly amusing ðŸ™‚
