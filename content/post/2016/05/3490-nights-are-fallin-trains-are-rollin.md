Vienna does not have much of a skyline. The slim, dark building to the right is the tallest in Vienna. It may get a sibling in a few years. The broad office buildings in the foreground right are the local UN headquarter, and the top three stories of the big building in the middle are used by the US secret services to spy on the UN. 

Vienna is not that big of a city ðŸ™‚
