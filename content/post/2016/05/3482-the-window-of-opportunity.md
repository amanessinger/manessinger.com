For those of you living in a big city: Do you ever visit your own museums?

I certainly do so on vacation in other cities. I rarely miss an important one. But Vienna? Yes, I've been a few times in <a href="https://www.khm.at/en/" target="_blank">Kunsthistorisches Museum</a>, Vienna's most important collection of paintings, but it took me more than 30 years to visit the <a href="https://www.akbild.ac.at/portal_en/akbild_startpage?set_language=en&cl=en" target="_blank">Academy of Fine Arts</a>. Yes, that's the academy that refused Hitler and forced him into politics. What a pity! The world of Art would have survived another talentless painter, but so many millions of people would have survived. The Academy has a much smaller collection, but it has one of the most interesting works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch" target="_blank">Hieronymus Bosch</a>.

Finally in January, and now we are where this image was taken, I visited <a href="http://www.albertina.at/jart/prj3/albertina/main.jart?rel=en&set-lang-cookie=y" target="_blank">Albertina</a>, the museum primarily known to me for its graphic art collection with DÃ¼rer's famous "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Hare" target="_blank">Young Hare</a>".

Oh how mistaken I found myself! They have a vast collection of modern Art with major works from the Impressionists, Expressionists, Surrealists and many more. In any case, if you are ever in Vienna and are even remotely interested in paintings, all three museums are well worth your time.
