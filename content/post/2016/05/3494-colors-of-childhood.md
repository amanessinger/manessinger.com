Yesterday's image, this one and a few of the following have all been made one on February, 20, more or less around noon. I had taken only a single lens with me, my most expensive one, the fabulous 40-150/2.8 PRO.

You see, not only do I take less images than in earlier time, I also write less about it and sometimes even I get bored. This is clearly reflected in the number of visitors.

Should I stop blogging? Is this even a blog now? Well, you clearly don't see me at the height of my enthusiasm, but photography is still very important to me. It's also not that I feel that I've lost my "eye". I just have less time. I read more, I have a lot of stress at work, and in my free time I put a lot of effort into "staying competitive".

Apart from that: this blog has been running for nine and a half years now. It would feel very odd stopping it before it reaches its tenth ðŸ™‚
