One of the marvels of digital photography is the option to correct perspective. I don't do it always, but in this case it was inevitable. 

I stood in front of that building, a do-it-yourself store, and I took an image of the reflection in the upper story window. The angle was quite steep, the distortion extreme, but I believe it took not more than a button click on Lightroom's automatic correction to give me this image, devoid of my own reflection.
