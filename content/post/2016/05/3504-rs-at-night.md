F3.2, 1/13s, ISO 6400. Dark again, but not only is the blue in the image much cleaner than it was from Lightroom, this time you have to look at the red fringe in the background. It's clean and vivid, while in Lightroom it was completely washed out.

Can you improve a correctly lit daylight image using DxO PRIME? No, you can't. To the contrary, it will cost you detail. Not much, but it will.

Above ISO 800? Seems like a safe bet on Micro Four Thirds. At ISO 1600 pretty much every camera will profit, and at any higher ISO it will work pure magic. You see me impressed.
