F1.8, 1/13s and ISO 6400? I suppose you agree: it must have been dark there ðŸ™‚

By the time you read this, the image should already be on Flickr in full size. Look at it at pixel level. 

Not impressed? Ok, now look at the small red inscription on the green glass in the upper left corner. Look at the small yellow reflexes on the chrome against the dark sky. That's what I mean when I praise DxO PRIME's color purity. I've never seen anything like that before.
