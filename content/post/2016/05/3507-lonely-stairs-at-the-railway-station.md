This image was taken at f5.6, 1/20s and ISO 1600. I wouldn't have needed DxO to process it. I did, just to try out their keystone correction tool. 

Well, it works ðŸ˜„

In the end, the result of my evaluation of DxO Optics Pro 10 was that I bought it. You need the "Elite" version in order to get PRIME noise reduction, and while I was at it, I just bought the whole suite, including Viewpoint (the geometry correction tool, also with support for eye-friendly de-fishing) and Filmpack.
