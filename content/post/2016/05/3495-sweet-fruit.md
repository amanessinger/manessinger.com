Truly, I can hardly remember a winter that was more mild than this one. We had snow on only two occasions (although in one case actually in spring, during full blossom) and it melt away within no time. Still, as always in winter I was hungry for color, and as so many times before, the bright colors of advertising posters were a satisfying substitute for the real thing.
