You have to pay some small entrance fee in order to visit the sacristy.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_131700_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_131700_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's not absolutely mandatory to do so, but that's not because it is not beautiful. It is, albeit in all the splendor of the monastery, in a way the sacristy is just more of the same. A wonderful ceiling one more time, though not very different from that in the nave. 

Here we see tasteful consistency again. Well, that's what happens when a church is built in a relatively short time, and in order for this to happen, an enormous amount of money must be available ðŸ˜„
