They have so, since I visited my first one about 27 years ago.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_134037_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_134037_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I can't really tell why. Probably it's because we have not so many old monasteries in Austria, and certainly not in Carinthia, where I was born. Actually Carinthia has always been a backward province, more rural than anything else.

During the age of Baroque there was a lot of money in Austria and Germany, therefore many of the old monasteries were rebuilt in baroque style, much like São Vicente.

As a functional part of a monastery, the cloister is really a mediaeval concept. There were no "living" cloisters after Renaissance.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_134321_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_134321_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The first that I saw were in southern France, a region that waned in importance after its fall as an independent Occitaine and its de facto occupation by the north.

Among the most beautiful cloisters I always remembered the oriental splendor of Monreale in Sicily, the delightful elegance of Mont Saint Michel, and now the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos is also in that league.
