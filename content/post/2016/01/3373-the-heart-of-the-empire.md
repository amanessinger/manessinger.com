The choir is the resting place of King Manuel I and his wife Maria of Aragon (tombs on the left side), and King Jo√£o III and his wife Queen Catherine of Austria.

Under the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_I_of_Portugal" target="_blank">Manuel I</a>, the great explorer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama" target="_blank">Vasco da Gama</a> discovered the sea route around Africa to India, laying the foundation for Portugal's wealth, at the same time spelling an end to the dominance of Venice. All of a sudden the Arabian Middle East could be circumvented, spices and all the riches of India could be traded without paying taxes to a dozen intermediaries.
