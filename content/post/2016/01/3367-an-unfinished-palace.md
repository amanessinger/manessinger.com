Just as Austria, Portugal is a small country, but while Austria was much bigger before the Great War, Portugal was always of its current size.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_104621_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_104621_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> What Portugal had and Austria direly lacked (at least if we disregard the short episode of the reign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" target="_blank">Charles V</a>), that were colonies. Colonies were the wealth of Portugal, colonies were what it clung to, almost to a bitter end, and that wealth is the reason for the unusual number of oversized imperial buildings in and around Lisbon.

One example for that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajuda_National_Palace" target="_blank">Palácio Nacional da Ajuda</a>. I didn't go in, I just went through its courtyard on my way to Belém.
