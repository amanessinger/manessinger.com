I'm glad I looked it up. I'd already wanted to sell it to you as the tomb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco_da_Gama" target="_blank">Vasco da Gama</a>. Turns out I haven't seen it. It looks very similar and must be on the other side of the entrance hall, on that side, where light was really, really bad.

So, this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_de_Cam%C3%B5es" target="_blank">Luís Vaz de Camões</a>, a classical poet instead of an explorer, younger than Vasco da Gama, but still from the period of Portugal's highest power.

The image is an HDR, made in Lightroom from two exposures. As you'd expect, with the dark interior and the bright window, contrasts were brutal.
