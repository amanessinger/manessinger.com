I don't have a good picture of the courtyard of <a href="http://Palácio Nacional da Ajuda" target="_blank">Palácio Nacional da Ajuda</a>, but honestly, I was not terribly impressed anyway.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_105400_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_105400_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The backside of the building is somewhat anticlimactic. Basically the western wall of the courtyard is just that: a wall.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_105543_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_105543_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the other side is a street, and across the street is the entrance to some military installation, barracks or something like that. The flowers between the rubble across the street were beautiful though. That's what you see in the Image of the Day.
