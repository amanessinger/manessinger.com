This was the first image that I've processed after returning from Lisbon. If I had taken no other image, it would still have been a successful trip.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_134818_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_134818_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Actually I have a whole series of these images. They were hard to take, because I had to crouch and bend back in order to get the frame. That's very awkward and not exactly a steady stance for shooting handheld at a quarter of a second ðŸ™‚

Here's a variant taken at 12&nbsp;mm, but really, the wide angle makes all the  difference for me.
