You may remember, the cloister has two stories, and the last two images of the previous post were already taken from the stairs up to the upper floor.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150904_135330_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150904_135330_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> When you go up the stairs, you can turn right into the cloister, or left back into the church. That's where we are now, back in the church, on the gallery above the tombs of the poet and the explorer. From there we look one more time through the giant forest and into the heart of the empire.

Isn't this majestic?

By the way, the second image was taken handheld at 1/13&nbsp;s at 52&nbsp;mm using the Olympus 40-150/2.8. Love this lens.
