I already mentioned that Lisbon is not easy to navigate for wheelchair users, that not even all of the underground stations are free of barriers, but then there are some that must be scary to anyone who suffers from vertigo. 

The descent from Chiado into the station Baixa-Chiado is such a place. A stairway down, then a chain of four steep escalators, followed by one final stairway. A long way to fall if you fall ðŸ™‚
