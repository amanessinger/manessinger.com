After my visit to the National Pantheon (and a fine meal in a nearby restaurant), I finally found my way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Jorge_Castle" target="_blank">the castle</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_172942_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_172942_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This is the center of old Lisbon, a place where originally a Moorish castle stood.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_170742_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_170742_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Only the outer walls of the castle are left, and as far as I know, much of it is a reconstruction from Salazar's time.

Still, it's one of the best views in town and it is probably the only place from where you can see almost all of Lisbon's vast expanse.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150903_170840_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150903_170840_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> By the way, speaking of expanse, the population of Lisbon is only slightly more than half a million, with a total of around three million for the greater area. I don't know why, but Lisbon somehow looks much bigger than it is. Maybe it's only the abundance of incredibly rich buildings. In any case, Lisbon definitely looks like the metropolis of a former empire of global scale.
