The originals are wildly distorted and the results of my corrections are small and of disputable quality. Sorry for that.

The problem is, that I had to go very near and very wide, this time to get all the people out of the images. Furthermore I held the camera high above my head in an attempt to minimize distortions.

But then again, this church was built by the king of a global empire at the height of its power.

By the way, an interesting detail are the two elephants supporting the tomb. If you look back to yesterday's post, you can see the same arrangement with the royal tombs in the choir. This church is not only stylish, it is also consistent in its style ðŸ™‚
