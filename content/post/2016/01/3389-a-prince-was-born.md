We have taken the slow way out to Bel√©m. First from the hotel down to the bus, with the bus to Ajuda, where we saw an unfinished palace and a botanic garden. From there we strolled down to our main destination of the day, the Mosteiro dos Jer√≥nimos. We left the monastery for the monuments to the west of it, and from there we could have taken a bus or a train back to the center. But then, having not all the time in the world, I thought a taxi would be a good idea.

The church was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrela_Basilica" target="_blank">Bas√≠lica da Estrela</a>, a church built to celebrate the birth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9,_Prince_of_Brazil" target="_blank">Dom Jos√©</a>, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza, heir to the crown. While he died at the age of 27 from smallpox, the church in its magnificence is still here to see. It can be considered one of the countless "minor sights" of Lisbon, but that only speaks to the quality of Lisbon's architecture üôÇ

Directly in front of the church is a tramway station. From there I took a ride down the hill, through Baixa, passing Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio and then up the opposite hill, through Alfama and around the castle. <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?ie=UTF-8&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fpt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMiradouro_da_Senhora_do_Monte" target="_blank">Miradouro da Senhora do Monte</a> is our final destination on this eventful day.
