Al least taking the tramway all the way up the opposite hill, around the castle and to our Miradouro was the plan. In practice I took the wrong train, one that stops down by the river, more or less below the cathedral. That meant going up the hill one more time.

In the end I found it satisfying. The light was fine and although you shouldn't miss a ride by tramway in Lisbon, from a photographer's point of view the slow ascent is better anyway. You may sometimes have to back out of a dead end though ðŸ™‚
