By the time you read this, I will have the PEN-F for a week, by the time I'll write the next post, I will have used it for half a week. I guess I'll be able to give you at least a first impression in tomorrow's post.

What will I do with the PEN E-P5? I have no idea. The original plan was to sell it, and I might still do that, but then, it's also a beautiful camera for sure. 

Of course the problem is, that I don't even need two bodies, and therefore much less three. We'll see ðŸ™‚
