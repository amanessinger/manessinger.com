The last images were all taken with the 25/1.8. It's a faultless lens. It's light, small, it focuses swiftly, and in fact I greatly prefer it over the Panaleica 25/1.4.

Now Olympus is coming out with a 25/1.2 PRO. It will be big, heavy and gorgeous. Will I want it? Yes, sure. Will I need it? Hell, no! Will I buy it? I have no idea.

The other new lenses? A 30/3.5 macro sounds like the perfect materialization of what I don't need. I'll pass this one for sure.

Then there is a 24-100/4 PRO. Hmm ... Sure, why? But then ... ???

And then there are all the other gadgets coming out this fall. A new Macbook Pro? Stupid, stupid, stupid, but tempting.

A new Google phone, now that my Nexus 5 won't be blessed with Nougat? Well, my Nexus 9 tablet is, and I can't see much difference. But still ...

Oh, and then there is the OM-D E-M1 MkII ðŸ™‚

Isn't all that terribly stupid? But then, I may dodge one or the other stupidities rolling my way, but I can't imagine dodging all of them. Let's seee ðŸ™‚
