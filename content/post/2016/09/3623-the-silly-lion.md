Long ago, in Austria's glorious past, we owned all of Venice. It was only a short period following the Napoleonic wars and before we lost our war against the Prussians, but nevertheless it made sense to have a sculpture of the Lion of Saint Mark's, Venice's symbol, in the hall of Vienna's sounth-bound railway station.

Today this is Vienna Main Station, a new and in my eyes quite successful attempt at station building. It's all glass, steel and polished stone, but the lion is still there. It doesn't always look this silly, by the way ðŸ™‚
