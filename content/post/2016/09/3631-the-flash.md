I have not yet sold my E-P5. When the PEN-F arrived, I removed the battery and the SD card, and then I put the camera into a closet. Today I took it out for a comparison. 

What can I say? I miss the big viewfinder! Yes, the VF-4 sticks out from the E-P5, it mars the beautiful design, it just doesn't look that classy. Looking through it makes a world of a difference though ðŸ™‚

It's really like the difference between APS-C and full-frame. You notice the change and it's a big one.

I've tried the same with the E-M1, and of course as it shares viewfinder specs with the VF-4, the result is the same. 

Then I noticed something interesting: both the E-M1 and the E-P5 were pretty much off colorwise and they were also darker. The PEN-F on the other hand was incredibly accurate in reproducing what I saw.

There was also another change. Exposure parameters blended into the viewfinder image had some amount of transparency. Or had they? Now that I try to reproduce it, I find that I can't. That's funny, because I've already noticed it another day. I don't think I've just imagined it.

Yes, indeed, I've just checked, there is an slight amount of transparency in the overlay. It's still fully readable, but it is slightly less intrusive.

Another slight annoyance is, that with the position of the eye sensor on the PEN-F, stray light easier enters the sensor, especially when the sun comes from the back. If that happens, the EVF blanks out. This doesn't happen when I hold the camera properly to my eye, but sometimes I don't. I suppose it also may happen when you wear glasses.

Basically this all boils down to the fact that I like the new viewfinder better (if it is indeed the viewfinder and not just  changes in metering and white balance accuracy), but that the lower resolution hurts. I'd like to call it a draw, but it isn't really. 

Is this a reason to switch back to the E-P5 and sell the PEN-F? No. If there were no other advantages but the better design and the convenience of the integrated viewfinder, I'd say yes. Fortunately there's more to this camera. We've already discussed the exposure compensation wheel, and tomorrow we'll talk about image quality.
