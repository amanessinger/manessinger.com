A bus stop below a combined highway and railway bridge. This is a most unpleasant place, but I have to wait there for the bus at least weekly on my way to Carinthia. What can I say, this is the second image that I was able to make there. It's unlikely that I'll ever bother you with a third one though ðŸ™‚
