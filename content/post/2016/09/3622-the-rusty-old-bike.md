There's a deplorable scarcity of bicycles where I live and work now. You've heard my lament ðŸ™‚

On the other hand, sometimes you find them where you wouldn't expect it. Here for instance is one mounted to the top of a fence at a restaurant.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160522_145817_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160522_145817_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> There was really no good angle for a decent background. I let the 75/1.8 take care of the problem. The lines in the background are from the railing of a bridge. Unfortunately nothing could be done about them. Cloning was out of the question ðŸ™‚
