Keeping everything in focus is essential to this image. Again here's a typical image where a smaller sensor helps. 

I'm much nearer to the overhead contact line than the line is to the building crane in the background. It must be a factor of 50 or more. Not the best circumstances, but f8 on MFT did the trick, and that's an aperture where diffraction does not set in yet.
