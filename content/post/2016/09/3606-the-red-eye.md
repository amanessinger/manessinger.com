This image certainly does not demonstrate the Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95's best use. It's a manual lens and it does not report any information to the camera, but I guess this was at least f5.6, and at that aperture it is just another good normal lens, only slower to focus ðŸ™‚

Nevertheless, you can't always pick your subjects and how they want to be taken.
