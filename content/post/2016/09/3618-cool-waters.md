I'm growing old. On a free day in Vienna I thought I'd take some images of waterfalls.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160522_122540_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160522_122540_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> They don't come aplenty around Vienna, but there are a few not far away to the south. MyrafÃ¤lle (Myra Falls) they are called, and they are quite a tourist attraction.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160522_122147_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160522_122147_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Lots of people queue at the entrance in the lower part of the gorge. The way through is extremely busy, but if you're patient, it's definitely possible to get some images that look like "wilderness".

Of course it was not the right time of the day, at least if you're looking for silky water. On the other hand, using a tripod in that location would have been completely impossible anyway, therefore even a very strong neutral density filter wouldn't have been an option. I took my images with small apertures instead (most of the time f10) and tried to avoid the most contrastful areas.

The funny thing is, and that's the reason why I say I'm growing old, it took me all the way through the gorge to realize that I had already been there once. I don't remember when though. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160522_121208_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160522_121208_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I know that I must have turned around somewhere after the middle, because I don't remember the - rather unspectacular - upper part, where the gorge widens and you follow a small and quiet creek. 

Actually I don't remember having taken photographs either, so it may have been sometime around 2000 or even earlier. In any case I found the experience of that memory loss a little bit spooky ðŸ™‚
