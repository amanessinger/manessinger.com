This is a power station in Vienna, not far from my office. I should have had it in view from my room on seventh floor looking west. Now I'm on fifth and looking east, but I should have seen it for more than a year. Interestingly enough I never consciously saw it.

Of course when I stood in front of it, there was no way to ignore it, but isn't visual perception a funnily subjective process?
