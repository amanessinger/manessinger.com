Two days ago I wrote about how I would want my camera to allow me to tag manual lenses while shooting. The process wouldn't suit everyone, but it would suit me fine. 

My wish won't be fulfilled though. This is the kind of wishes that never get fulfilled. That's sad.

Can you remember computer game arcades? Yes, I mean those places where you had to go if you wanted to play computer games. Each game had a dedicated computer with a dedicated set of input devices like steering wheels, pistols or flipper-like buttons. For a while those devices flourished, even while you could already buy the first home computers. They had the advantage of better input devices and better screens, and they were in places where you could meet your friends and play together. Then they vanished.

Can you imagine today's computers being like that? Don't get me wrong, some are, and the industry certainly prefers dedicated computers and tries to push them all the time. Modern game consoles are a little bit like that, early mobile phones certainly were, but generally people don't like them. People like multi-purpose computers, or actually they like the idea of being able to control the software that runs on their computers themselves.

For some it is enough to be able to buy any software they like, and some even want to write their software themselves.

You can do that on a general-purpose computer, regardless of whether it runs Windows, OSX, Linux, Android or iOS. I think you should also be able to do it on a camera.
