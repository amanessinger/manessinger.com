My new PEN-F has a 20 megapixel sensor, and while I can't complain about its quality, it is only a very incremental change up from the E-M1. 

On the other hand it is incredible how much of a game changer DxO is. This image has been taken with the PEN E-P5 (same sensor as the E-M1) at ISO 6400, f4 and 1/6s. I've shot it at night in a very, very dark part of the street. It looks like, well, maybe ISO 800. And it's not only the lack of noise, it's also the purity of colors. Buying DxO has given me the equivalent of maybe eight years of sensor development. That's incredible.

OK, that's just to put the improvements of the PEN-F into relation ðŸ™‚
