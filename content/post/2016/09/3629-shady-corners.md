Again this is no image taken with the PEN-F. There won't be any until mid-winter. But we can talk about it. Let's see what else is interesting.

The viewfinder is a step back from the VF-4 that I bought with the PEN E-P5. No denial, it is smaller. It does not stick out from the camera though. In fact the whole camera looks smaller and much more retro.

Instead of a Gariz case (like for the E-P5) I bought the original <a href="http://www.getolympus.com/us/en/grip-for-pen-f-ecg-4.html" target="_blank">Olympus metal grip</a> instead. It has the same huge price as the very elegant Gariz leather half-case, but it gives better hold. Both have an opening in the bottom plate that allows access to the battery and (theoretically) the SD card. 

Why I say theoretically? Well, it does so, but you'd have to have very small fingers. I could get the SD card out of the E-P5 in the Gariz case, but I can't get it out of the PEN with the Olympus grip.

That's stupid. I mean, it would have been perfectly possible to make the opening big enough for the door to the battery/card compartment to open wider. They didn't. It's hard to imagine that nobody had issues with that during testing, but even if so, they must have chosen to ignore it. For a $130 piece of alumunium this is unacceptable. What do I? I've put a pair of pincers into my bag. Problem solved, albeit in a most embarrassing way ðŸ™‚
