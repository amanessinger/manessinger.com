Both of today's images were taken through my spying glass, the big, heavy 40-150/2.8 PRO. What did I bring along? The usual vacation gear (aka "The Big Gear"), meaning the trinity of the Olympus PRO lenses. Additionally I carried the small fisheye. I had bought it only days before the trip, and I figured I should use it while it was new, otherwise I'd probably forget about it ðŸ™‚

I used to do it on vacations, but I have stopped at least ten years ago, maybe much, much longer. 

In a way it was a nice ritual: searching typical, beautiful post cards that still avoided clichÃ©s, trying to perfectly match cards and recipients, trying to write individual, witty messages tailored to their recipients, buying stamps, finally searching for a mailbox. Yes, it sounds tedious, and that's probably the main reason why we stopped doing it ðŸ™‚
