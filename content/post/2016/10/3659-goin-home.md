This image has been taken three minutes after yesterday's. The sky may have been slightly darker if at all, the street lights had the same color. I could again have played off orange against blue, but with the strong light fall-off from top to bottom, I figured I would need more violent manipulations to make that image sing - if it could be brought to sing at all.

In that situation I normally go B&amp;W. It's easier, because when you raise extreme contrasts from shadowy corners, you often have to struggle with color casts. You can get the tonality that you crave for, but the colors betray you immediately. It's not something that can't be fixed, but for one it's hard, and then, it may not even be worth it. There are scenes that cry for B&amp;W, and in my opinion this is one of them.
