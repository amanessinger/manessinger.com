This is a little bit odd and actually surprising. Exactly ten years ago I've posted "<a href="/2006/10/1-after-grandma-has-gone.html" target="_blank">1 â€“ After Grandma Has Gone</a>". Ten times 365 plus three days from leap years, in my book that makes 3653. Somewhere along the line we've lost five posts, have we?

Maybe not. I can't be sure that I haven't missed a post or two, although I deem it unlikely. Five posts? No way!

The most likely explanation is, that I've re-used the last number five times. It happens. I've caught myself doing it, and so far I have assumed that I've caught myself every single time that it happened. I may have been wrong.

Anyway. This blog is ten years old and I pretend it has been daily. I'm not going to look for the errors and renumber a few thousand posts ðŸ™‚

When I began, I found my numbering scheme a little pretentious, but I decided to do it anyway. I saw it as kind of motivational, and really, it was. Next target: 4000 in little less than a year.
