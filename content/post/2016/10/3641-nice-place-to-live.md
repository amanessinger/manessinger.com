There are a few pretty nice places to live in Vienna. Actually I have no idea what we're looking at here, an old building with a modern annex or an old building in front of a modern one? Hard to say, but I'd like to live in all three versions. 

The big roof terrace is looking down on "Donaukanal", a side arm of river Danube and probably the part of the river that is most integrated with the city. That view alone must be literally priceless.

If it's really two buildings here, then I'd still like to have a room in that round tower at the corner. It's lovely.

And, of course, if we look at some kind of architectural fusion, my envy is boundless ðŸ˜„
