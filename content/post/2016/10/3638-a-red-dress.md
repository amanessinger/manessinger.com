This image and the last few, they were all taken in a part of Vienna near to where I used to live for almost 30 years. 

It's different there. Better perhaps. But it's not lost. I just have to ride the Underground, and it takes me no longer than 25 minutes to get back to the old hunting grounds. It's just that I don't do it as often as I should ğŸ™‚
