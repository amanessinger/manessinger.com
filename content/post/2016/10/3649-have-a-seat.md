I think I've mentioned it when it happened: I've bought a fisheye. It's not the fancy over-the-top Olympus 8/1.8, but instead a manual Walimex 7.5mm f3.5 lens that was on sale at Amazon. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160611_130743_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160611_130743_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These and yesterday's wall are some of the first images taken with it. I don't expect to use it very often, but at times it's funny. The extremely short focal length makes it pretty "fishy" even on Micro Four Thirds. The subject? A forklift in a factory building.
