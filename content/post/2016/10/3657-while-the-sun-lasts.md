If there is anything like a composition typical for me, this is probably it. You may have seen similar pictures over and again. If it's not your thing, you must be annoyed by now. I can't help it though. The moment I see such a scene, dying light caressing an old wall, I have to take a picture. It's automatic.

If it's not your thing, please come back tomorrow. There will be something different ðŸ™‚
