Graffiti are a dated clich√©. The current visual language of Street Art always reminds me of album covers of the early 1970s. Not much has changed in mainstream graffiti since then. Sometimes I ask myself who makes them today. Still young people? People of my age?

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160607_172100_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160607_172100_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's a visual language from the time when I was young, and it's a time that has influenced my aesthetics and my mentality. My whole conception of freedom dates from that time.

He was a young, good looking man of 32 years, a boy relative to my current age, yet already father to my three year old self. Today he is 81, fighting cancer, tired and old. Time is not kind.
