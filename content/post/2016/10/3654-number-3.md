Does not look like stereotypical Provence, does it? Well, don't fear, we'll get to that ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160619_193446_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160619_193446_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Today's images (and tomorrow's as well) were taken on Place des Cardeurs, where we sat for our first dinner. It's one of the few places spacious enough that you can sit outside in the sun. Most other places crowded with restaurants are narrow and always in the shadow. It does not matter after sunset, but with long June days I enjoyed dining in the sun.
