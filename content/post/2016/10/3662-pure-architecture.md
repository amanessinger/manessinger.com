Empty halls of pure architecture. That's what those old French monasteries are.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160620_111605_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160620_111605_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The first two images have been taken with rectilinear lenses. I've used the 7-14/2.8 for the big hall of the church. Could easily be mistaken for Dwarvish architecture in Moria, below the Misty Mountains, right?

It's a manual lens without electronic communication between lens and body, but I am absolutely sure I have used it wide open. 

It's the first time I have used a fisheye on vacations. You won't see it in use very often, but during the months since, I have found it to be a valuable addition to my "Big Gear".
