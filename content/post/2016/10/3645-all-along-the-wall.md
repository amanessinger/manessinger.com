I write this on Saturday, October 8. Trump has not yet given up and the Republican Party has not yet distanced itself from him. When this post is published on October 11, we may know more.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160607_172641_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160607_172641_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Isn't that puzzling and altogether a worrying state of democracy? In Donald Trump we have someone who is probably the most obviously unfit-for-politics politician from his growing peer group. Nobody even in his own party wanted him, and nevertheless he got voted into candidacy, acclaimed by a diverse public, that is only united by a strong, common disgust of politics.

What can you possibly do? Change horses? Yes, that could be an honest thing to do, but seemingly they wait until they clearly see that their chances on the presidency are over. But are they? Scott Adams clearly <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/151504993671/why-does-this-happen-on-my-vacation-the-trump">doesn't think so</a>, and he may well have a point. At least I think that everybody who is disgusted now, would likely have been disgusted already. 

Lots and lots of people don't agree with Political Correctness, but they don't say so, because it's not politically correct. It's even understandable, because ideals and real behavior are rarely in tune. Political Correctness is frequently pure lip service, and in face of that, someone like Trump may be seen as refreshingly different. 

In an ideal world Trump wouldn't have been able to come even near candidacy. In an ideal world Trump wouldn't even have become a media star. An ideal world would punish his behavior and his business methods. The world is far from ideal though. The outcome of the election will tell us a lot about how far.
