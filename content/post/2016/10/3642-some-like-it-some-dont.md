In general I like it. You may call it Graffiti, you may call it Street Art, although in most cases the word "Art" is a little bit far fetched. In many cases it's not more than vandalism, and I admit that my relaxed stance is probably best explained by the fact that I am not a house owner. 

My interest in Graffiti is that of a photographer and it is in details. Graffiti are colorful landscapes projected onto our urban canvas. Most of the time their weakness is in the way their totality lacks definition. Amorphically they are clustered around a strong, colorful signal, but towards the borders they run out into nothingness. That's why I always frame them tightly.
