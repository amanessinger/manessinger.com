Don't know what exactly reminds me of Ravenholm here. Maybe it's the color black, the fiery lights, the feeling that you don't see what's out there, the feeling of being watched nevertheless.

Oh, you don't know Ravenholm? That's an uncanny place in the game "Half Life 2". It's the place where you first encounter black headcrabs. It's a place where you are constantly lured into wasting ammo - until you really, really need it and almost run out of it.

Don't play games? Well, I do occasionally ðŸ˜„
