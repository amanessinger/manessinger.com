Interesting. Quite a few of the last images were taken with the Olympus 60/2.8 macro lens. None of the images is a macro of course, but I really, really like this lens. I like the tight perspective and I like the light weight. 

I tend to carry three lenses at any time. If I'm on vacation or in Carinthia and using the car, I frequently use the three pro lenses. To Vienna I normally travel lighter though. Something like 12-17-45 or 12-25-45 or even 12-25-75 are my go-to triples when I lust for primes. The 60/2.8 may at times take the part of the long lens in such a triple, but if I need it light and flexible, I may also couple it with the 9-18 and the 25/1.8. That's how I travel today.
