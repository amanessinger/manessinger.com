Once, a long time ago, I was the King of Bikes. Where I lived, in the most progressive district near the center of Vienna, bicycles were ubiquitous. Now, living on the edge of town, that is long gone. It's all cars, cars, cars.

This image was taken on an afternoon when I had a meeting in a department more or less where I once worked.

It's interesting. As soon as I get there, as soon as I see the old environment, the old instincts are back in the minute. It's really a different kind of attention to a different kind of things.
