I remembered to have taken this image around midnight, but no, it was just early evening. It didn't make a difference though. In mid-January it's all the same ðŸ™‚

The image posed a challenge though. It was taken at an Underground station with light coming mostly from orange sodium-vapor street lights, along with some much cooler light spill from the station. Believe me, there's no proper white balance for the whole picture. I've used different gradients with different white balance settings and different exposure / contrast /saturation / vibrance settings, I've generally taken out a lot of blue, and at least the bike itself seems pretty accurate to me now.

Was it worth it? Well, as an exercise in any case, and I like at least the composition ðŸ˜„
