I already ordered the Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95 in September, but it took until end of November to finally arrive. When it did, I got it two days after my second copy of the 60/2.8. It's small wonder that the spectacular f0.95 lens got all my attention.

Nevertheless, I keep using the unspectacular macro lens from time to time, and the longer I do so, the more I love it. I sold it once, but I'll never do that again ðŸ™‚
