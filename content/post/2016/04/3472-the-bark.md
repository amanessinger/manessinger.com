I think I haven't taken less images in any period of the last ten years than in in the last few months. Here we have the sole survivor of a desperate attempt one afternoon in Villach. Nevertheless, in black and white it even turned out interesting.

It's hard to tell what the reason for my dwindling interest in photography was. A that time, in late December, I didn't have the stress at work that I currently have, and I didn't have anything else that occupied me or my mind. It was just some kind of sluggishness. Thankfully that seems to be over now ðŸ™‚
