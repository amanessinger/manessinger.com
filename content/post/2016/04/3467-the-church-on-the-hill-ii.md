The church of Sankt Peter am Wallersberg was in a perfect place that day: just where the fog ended.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20151227_111803_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20151227_111803_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The effect of the church's shadow on the fog was almost bizarre. Actually if someone would have asked me if that's possible, I'd have denied it. Looks cool, huh?
