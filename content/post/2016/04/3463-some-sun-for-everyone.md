This building belongs to a home for the elderly. It's directly opposite my office. I may have taken the image out of my window. The whole complex has been carefully constructed to offer mixed use. There are offices, some shops, a restaurant, a home for the elderly, a home for students, all situated around a nice plaza. And then there are a lot of residential buildings.

Actually there should have been a lot more offices, but as it is, office space is in abundance in Vienna, and only the best locations are able to attract companies able to pay for the overpriced spaces. This is not the best of locations, it's a tad too far from the next underground station, and therefore more resicetial buildings were built than the desire fore an even mix would have mandated.
