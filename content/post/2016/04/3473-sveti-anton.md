If you think this image of Saint Anthony of Padua is on a church, you're wrong. It's on the wall of a farm house near the church in Feistriz im Gailtal, a village on the north side of the mountains, a place that hardly gets any sun in winter. Climate change may influence the snow, but it doesn't change the ways of the sun ðŸ˜„
