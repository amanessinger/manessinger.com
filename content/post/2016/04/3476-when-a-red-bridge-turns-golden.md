Using a macro lens for any kind of architectural photography is a little bit unusual. Maybe I should really, really try to take a few proper macro images some time ðŸ˜„

This red bridge is one of my favorite places when I need a quick image in Villach. It has enough architectural details, it's in the sunniest spot of Villach, it's just a few minutes from home and - did I mention it? - it's red! At least unless the sinking sun turns it golden.
