Did you know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas-Claude_Fabri_de_Peiresc" target="_blank">him</a>? Honestly, I didn't. In any case, it's an impressive list of scientific fields that he was involved in. 

Sure, it was easier then. So many things were waiting to be discovered, and many of them didn't need a lot of apparatus to begin with. If they did, it helped to be rich. He certainly was that ðŸ™‚
