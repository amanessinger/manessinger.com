A new day, a new town. This is Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume. We are here for the church. There's kind of a fair or a market in front and north of the church, where we would normally park our car. I've found a place behind the church though, and that's where we are now, looking up at this bird soaring, and at the mighty shadow of its wing.
