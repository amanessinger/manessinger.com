Using a fisheye is hard. Before you look through the lens, you never know what you'll get.

Everything is round here anyway, you have to look twice to even see the fisheye effect.

The image from the chapter house is extreme, but then, in a certain way it conveys what I saw and how it felt to be there. That's a funny thing to say about an image that's totally distorted ðŸ™‚

Fisheyes: this is really stuff for experimentation. Try it out. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Predictions impossible ðŸ˜„
