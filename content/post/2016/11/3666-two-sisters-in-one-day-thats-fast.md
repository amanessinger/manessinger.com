You can take a lot of images of an architectural marvel like Silvacane, but once you're through, you're through.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160620_122948_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160620_122948_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In our case it was only half past noon, exactly the time we'd reckoned. Speeding from one Abbey to the next, we came around this bend and through this gate ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160620_124342_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160620_124342_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, photographically there would have been much better places than that where I chose to take two images. In fact I had seen quite a few fantastic places. The problem is, that you find no proper spot to hold the car. In fact this always makes me nervous, and when I finally can stop, I often take a few images, mostly to at least document the type of landscape that I've passed through.

The village in the third image is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnieux" target="_blank">Bonnieux</a>. Their <a href="http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/vaucluse/bonnieux/bonnieux.htm" target="_blank">website</a> claims <blockquote>No matter what route you take to Bonnieux, you will see the church tower well before you arrive</blockquote>It seems I managed to find a spot from where you don't see it ðŸ˜„

Anyway, it's a nice place, but we were only passing through. You can't properly visit every place that deserves it. Sad but true.
