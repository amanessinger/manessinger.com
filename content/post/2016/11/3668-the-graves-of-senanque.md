Lavender fields in B&amp;W? That would indeed be objectionable, but this post is not about lavender, this post is about the dead. See the graves on the backside of the church? This is the place where the monks find their last rest. 

In the original color version the crosses, being in the shadow on a bright, sunny day, would have been easy to miss. B&amp;W gave me the leeway to emphasize them dramatically but without ruining the image.
