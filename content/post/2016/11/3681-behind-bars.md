It's interesting to see what Trump will really do, now that he's managed to defeat "crooked" Hillary. It's all like a bad soap opera, isn't it? But then, a lot of his voters will get very, very angry if he doesn't follow up on his own announcements. The question is, does he care?

I think it's unlikely that we'll see Hillary Clinton behind bars, but I bet a lot of perfectly innocent, poor people will not be as lucky. Some of them will even have voted for him. Nobody will care though. Solidarity is for the communists.
