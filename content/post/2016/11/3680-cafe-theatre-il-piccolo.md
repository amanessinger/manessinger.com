There's a small, red theater in Aix-en-Provence. It's located in a narrow street south of and parallel to Cours Mirabeau. They call it "<a href="http://ilpiccolo.fr/" target="_blank">Il Piccolo</a>". 

It's not the smallest theater in the world though. That one is accidentally located <a href="http://kremlhof.vada.cc/" target="_blank">in Villach</a>, the town where I currently live. 1.3 times 1.3 meters, with a capacity for an audience of eight! How's that for a record ðŸ™‚
