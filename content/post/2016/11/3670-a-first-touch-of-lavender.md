Provence used to have more lavender than it has now. There's still a lot, but you have to search it out.

In the morning we passed an awesome spot. Wonderful color, a bit problematic with the high voltage power lines in the background, but it would definitely have been manageable.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160620_150636_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160620_150636_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I missed the right moment though. I drove too fast, and when I had fully taken in what we were passing, we were already well past. No problem, I thought, there must be something even better just around the next bend.

It wasn't. What you see here is the only other lavender field that I saw that day. The light was less dramatic, the colors were more muted and behind the cypress trees was a busy street. Well, I probably shouldn't have said that ðŸ˜„
