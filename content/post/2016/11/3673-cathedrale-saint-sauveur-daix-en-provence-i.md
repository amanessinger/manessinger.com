Aix-en-Provence is about twice the size of Villach, but it's much more than twice as beautiful ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160621_095409_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160621_095409_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Small wonder, the city looks back on a history of more than 2000 years. In any case it is big enough to rectify taking one or two days. That's what we did after the day with the two abbeys: we spent a lazy day in Aix.

That's were we went first, and here I was enjoying the rectilinear 7-14 again.

There's seems to be kind of a fundamental law of wide angles: If it's Baroque, you may use the fish. If it's Gothic, you need a rectilinear lens. Gothic architecture is all about straight lines. Go wide and play with them, but don' bend them ðŸ™‚
