Lavender is a hard test for your judgement and your honesty. It forces you to lie.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160623_102737_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160623_102737_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Make a Google <a href="http://www.google.at/search?q=lavender+provence&tbm=isch">image search for lavender</a>. You immediately see amazing (and sometimes atrocious) colors, but much of what you see is a blatant lie. Lavender does not look like on Flickr, it looks more or less like ... here in my images. Yes, two weeks later it may be stronger in color, but it is not that intense violet, that you so often see, and it's not an intense pink either.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160623_103301_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160623_103301_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Lavender's color is more modest. It is tempting to present it as something garish that it isn't, but even if you can resist, your troubles are only just beginning. The problem is, that it looks very different, depending on the light and your position relative to the sun.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160623_103332_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160623_103332_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's easy to make the test: On a sunny day, for instance at 10&nbsp;am, when the sun is already high but still directional, hold your car at a lavender field, take a few steps into it (being careful to stay between the rows and not to trample the flowers), and then take images in different directions. All those images will have been taken at roughly the same time, the difference will only be the direction of light and the amount of backlight.

All images will look vastly different. Some will look more "correct" and some less so. If you process all of them in the same way, you will have some that look grossly wrong.

What I did was trying to "harmonize" the images. That's a euphemism for lying, of course, but - believe me - I've tried the alternatives and they are worse.
