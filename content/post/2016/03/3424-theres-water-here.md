Some people think it's morbid to take photographs on a cemetery. I'm not one of them. Actually I like cemeteries and if you've followed this blog for some time, you've seen quite a few images taken there.

Often I go with the clich√© and visit them on foggy autumn days or in cold winter, but there's no reason not to do it on a sunny autumn day.
