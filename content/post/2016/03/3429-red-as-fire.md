This is another small trophy that I took away from Mauerbach. Sometimes I'm happy that I don't have to print all those images. If there is anything like "Color Gamut Hell", this must be close to it. Believe me, I know, I once printed <a href="/2007/11/386-thats-me.html" target="_blank">the picture in this post</a>, a picture now hanging on a wall in my apartment in Vienna ðŸ™‚
