Remember the Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95? Here it is, tried on my cat. Yes, I know, that "third ear" is irritating. In reality it is part of a lamp maybe half a meter behind Gamer's head.

The rest of the background? It's busy as it gets and on any other lens it would be distracting as hell. Here it just pleasantly melts away, and that is exactly what I have bought this lens for. On the other hand, what's in focus, is as sharp as anyone could like it to be.
