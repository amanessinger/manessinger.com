You've probably seen a lot of such images. I follow a number of architecture photographers on Flickr, who use such a style of black and white images, frequently coupled with long exposures.

I always wanted to know whether an image taken on a bright, sunny day can be converted in that way without resorting to optical filters and without Photoshop. There's nothing wrong with Photoshop, but for my daily work I much prefer the simplicity and speed of Lightroom.

Well, here we are: it works. This image has been processed exclusively in Lightroom ðŸ™‚
