Here we have two images of the new wooden tower on <a href="http://www.pyramidenkogel.info/" target="_blank">Pyramidenkogel</a> ("Pyramid Hill"), a free-standing hill with a great view over most of Carinthia.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20151115_161036_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20151115_161036_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It was the first time I've been there since they've replaced the old concrete tower, and unfortunately while I drove the 20&nbsp;km from Villach down to the tower, clouds gathered. When I arrived, the sun was gone and the light flat. I decided to skip buying a ticket and try it another time.

The images were taken with the Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95 at something like f4 or f5.6.
