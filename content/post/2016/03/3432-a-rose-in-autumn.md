Sometimes you go to the hospital because you are ill yourself, sometimes you visit someone, but a hospital is not a typical place to go for taking photos.

Well, maybe our ideas of the enjoyability of places are too much tied to what we know is happening there. Sometimes it is a good idea to relax and just see.

The hospital in Villach has a nice park in front, and I knew that I would find some beautiful autumn colors there. I mostly went for the roses and I definitely found what I was looking for.
