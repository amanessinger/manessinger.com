This is on the roof terrace of the building where I work. I noticed the shadows and the reflections, I went for the camera and took the image, and when I finally saw it on the screen ... I was disappointed. The distribution of light and of contrast, nothing worked at all.

In such cases I frequently go for black and white. Suddenly doing extreme contrast changes is easy, shadow noise is much less visible and the result looks much more abstract. And in the end I liked what I saw ðŸ™‚
