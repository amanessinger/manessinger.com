It's already early Spring around here, but image-wise we are just diving into Winter. Rest assured, it won't last very long.

Actually I had already wondered whether my lust to take images was gone. Then last Saturday I made 20 images on one short walk through Villach. This is not 20 exposures taken, this is 20 images processed and ready to be used on the blog. Not all of them are first rate, but, well, neither is everything I've published so far. In any case, I seemingly need just a lazy hour from time to time ðŸ˜„
