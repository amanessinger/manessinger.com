At least that's what this image reminds me of. But then, I don't like flags and I don't like nations.

Whenever things get tight, people tend to flock together in groups, tend to accentuate the differences and not the common, tend to seek salvation in separation. It's easy to see why. 

Keeping the unknown at bay and sticking to the known is a way of denying change. It's only that change does not come through refugees. Refugees come through change. 

Their world changes, and it is through our actions or our refusal to act. Sure, we can keep them out and just pretend that there is no problem. The problem is only that it does not work. 

By refusing to change we must change ourselves. By setting up borders we lose the freedom to cross them. By waging war in other countries we make ourselves the target of revenge. By following our fears we make them reality.

Bombs in Paris, bombs in Brussels, and the only thing we're capable of is to ramp up surveillance and further limit freedom. It didn't help the French and it didn't help the Belgians, did it?

Do you remember Terry Gilliam's prophetic movie "<a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/12/the-nightmare-of-terry-gilliams-brazil-30-years-later/" target="_blank">Brazil</a>"? Well, it positively begins to feel like that.
