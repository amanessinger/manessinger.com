Here's a rather unremarkable impression, an image taken while I waited for the tires to be changed. What's interesting, that is the lens. It is the Olympus 60/2.8 macro lens. Yes, the lens that I once owned and that I've sold, because I rarely used it. I've bought it again ðŸ™‚

As you may know, I rarely use macro lenses for macro photography, and indeed I rarely use them at all. It's only that Amazon had it for 100 â‚¬ off, and that's only slightly more expensive than what I can get if I sell it on once more. Basically it's a very high quality medium-long lens usable for portraits and certain kinds of street photography, it is very much lighter than the 75/1.8, and if the rare moment arises, it is a macro lens as well. Crazy you call me? I'm the first to agree ðŸ˜„
