This is the same sculpture as yesterday. The image has been taken with the same lens, the superb Olympus 7-14/2.8. As you see and just as in yesterday's image, there are some nice and unobtrusive flares. I could easily have taken them out, but they are of the kind that other people sometimes put in in Photoshop, so I didn't bother ðŸ™‚

The sun was right outside of the frame. I suppose my Olympus 9-18 would have fared almost as well. It's better than Sigma's 8-16 that I had on the Nikon D300. Sigma's flares are normally small, but they are intensively green. 

And the Panasonic 7-14? Well, don't get me started on that. I can only imagine the purple explosions all across the image. It's an interaction with the Olympus sensor though. As far as I've heard, the Panasonic 7-14 does very well on Panasonic cameras.
