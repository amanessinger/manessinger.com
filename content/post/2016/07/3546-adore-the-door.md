Two more images from inside the orangerie. I can't decide which one I like more, therefore you end up seeing both of them. Culling both would have been the other option, but I've got to feed a hungry blog ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160327_105135_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160327_105135_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The lens is the small and unspectacular Olympus 9-18/4.0-5.6, a light and small lens that works well for all but the biggest churches. Basically I have settled to use the "big gear" (E-M1 and the trinity) in Carinthia and on most vacations. In Provence I've added (and used!) my new fisheye, alternatively I may add the 25/0.95. 

In Vienna I use the P5 and a variation of small and light lenses. Wide could mean the 9-18, the fish, or this week it will be the 12&nbsp;mm prime. The "normal" is likely one of the 25s, less frequently it is the 17/1.8. Typically I round it off with something long, 45/1.8, 60/2.8 or the slightly heavy 75/1.8. If I think I need or want a zoom, the 40-150/4.0-5.6 is also an option.

My kit that day in SchloÃŸ Hof consisted of 9-18, 25/1.8 and 60/2.8.
