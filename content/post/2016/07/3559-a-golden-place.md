Allow me one last look into the orangerie. I promise it's the last time, ok?

It is the one without plants in it, the one with the benches, the one used for events. The distortion of the glass, the rich, filtered light on the wood inside, all that makes this a magic golden place. Unfortunately one that we're locked out of, but I suppose that's part of the magic ðŸ™‚
