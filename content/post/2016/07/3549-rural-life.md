There was one room in SchloÃŸ Hof with a collection of paper-cut dioramas depicting rural life of the past.

Just look at the stag in the foreground of the Image of the Day for an example.

Oh dear, if you've never tried that, you can't imagine how many potential white points there are in an image lit by a mix of different artifical and natural lights ðŸ™‚

In the end I'm pretty satisfied with the results. Everything was done in Lightroom only. Some things would probably have been easier in Photoshop, but these days I avoid it as much as I can. It's not for esthetic or puristic reasons, it's just that I hardly use it and forgot all the shortcuts ðŸ˜„
