Give nature a chance and see how it takes back even the largest wastes of stone. I shudder when I think of how expensive it must have been to maintain such a palace, especially when you don't have the income from a stream of tourists paying entrance fees.

But then, today's society is not any more equal. It's just that we don't as easily see the differences between rich and poor. Really, can you imagine what it means to own billions of dollars? Can you imagine how meaningless the whole concept of money becomes, once you have enough of it?
