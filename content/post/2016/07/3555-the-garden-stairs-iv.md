In Lightroom I tag everything that's destined to go on the blog with "manessinger.com". I also have a "smart collection" listing all images tagged as such. This way it is easy to have an overview of what I've already processed. 

In some cases I change my mind and don't use the picture. Then I don't remove the tag, I just add the picture to a collection "not used on blog". In the past I sometimes went back to that collection in times of need, but today, due to not automatically discarding what I can't use the day that I've shot it, I always have enough images processed in advance. At the moment 244 images wait in line - and I'm not even through with Provence ðŸ™‚

Yesterday I have added another smart collection in Lightroom. It shows images that end with ".jpg" (lower case, the JPGs from the camera use upper case) and that don't have the tag "manessinger.com". Basically these are processed images that I've not marked for usage. In a few cases this is intentional, in most cases I've simply forgot to tag them. Today's image is one of the latter category, found just in time to be used in this series of stairs images ðŸ˜„
