You have to admit, the old people definitely had some sense for grandeur. It's when you look at the details, you see things that you wouldn't expect. 

Take this long view all through the palace: If you'd plan something overly expensive like this, wouldn't you make sure everything lines up perfectly? I certainly would, but obviously it was no criterion here. The two gates are not exactly opposite, the fountain in the background is slightly off-axis, and so are the pillars of the garden gate behind.

Sloppiness? Chance? A sense of aesthetics lost to us? I don't know. Do you?
