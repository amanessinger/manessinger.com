Yes, here I work. It's not an architectural marvel, it's not even remotely beautiful, but in fact it is a very functional building. When I first heard we wouldn't have air conditioning, I was devastated, but in fact I soon found out we don't need it. Even in the hottest summer, the building is cool at its core, while in winter it is nicely warm. 

Well, maybe I feel fine across a wider range of temperatures than most people, because when I think of it, I may have heard a few complaints. Anyway, say what you will, for me that new building was a success ðŸ˜„
