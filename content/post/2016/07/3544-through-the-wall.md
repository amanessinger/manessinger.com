The "White Peacock" is the biggest public restaurant at the palace. It is in one of the side buildings.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160327_103244_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160327_103244_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It has a big terrace and it was a pleasure to eat there on a sunny, but not yet too hot day.

There are all sorts of ways between the buildings, some leading through doors in the walls between. The Image of the Day shows one such way. It exploits the symmetry of the decoration and the sensor's pretty extensive DOF. The lens is the 60/2.8 macro at f8. I love the effect of the compression and how it makes the doorway look almost like a mural.
