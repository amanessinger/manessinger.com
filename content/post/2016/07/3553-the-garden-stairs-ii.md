It was early in the year for a visist to this magnificent palace and its gardens. Some might say too early, because the garden was not in full bloom yet, but still I had to wait for each perspective to become clear of people. 

In a way it's funny when you think of it: those stairs were made to display the rich and the noble, parading like peacocks.
