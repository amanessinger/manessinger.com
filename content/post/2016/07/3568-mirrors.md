I can't exactly remember why there were two mirrors in this location. I suppose it's all about traffic and looking around corners, only that I can't remember a corner at all. And the yellow light atop? If it is one? 

I don't remember, but in retrospect I do see why I found the whole arrangement bizarre enough to make me urge for an image ðŸ˜„
