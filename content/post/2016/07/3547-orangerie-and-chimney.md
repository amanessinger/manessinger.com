Once more we see the second of the two orangeries, the one with the draperies.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160327_105339_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160327_105339_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The Image of the Day was taken with the 9-18 at 9&nbsp;mm, the other one with the 60/2.8. 

It's funny that I once sold that macro and finally re-bought it when Amazon had a deal. But then, today I think much more in lens combinations than in absolute focal lengths. Sure, 60/2.8 could be seen as redundant between 45/1.8 and 75/1.8, especially when one does not take macro images, but now I just see it as a lighter alternative to the 75. 

Well, maybe these are the rationalization games I began to play, once the number of lenses surpassed what I was willing to carry ðŸ˜„
