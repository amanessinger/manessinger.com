The door at the end of this corridor, that's where I currently work. Thankfully with the new office building we've said good-bye to open floor plans. People work in small rooms with between two and - rarely - six persons, and due to the generous attitude towards teleworking, many work from home one or two days a week. 

On the one hand the new attitude was a concession to the majority of our collegues, for whom the new location of the office brought drastic increases in commuting time, and on the other hand everybody works on virtual machines anyway. You can do that from any place in the world, so why not from home?
