Wikipedia calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pessoa" target="_blank">Fernando António Nogueira Pessôa</a> one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the Portuguese language. He left a small number of published works and a trunk with 25,574 unpublished pages. Editing is still in progress.

An interesting aspect in Pessôa's work is his extensive use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_%28literature%29" target="_blank">heteronyms</a>. Pessôa used more than 70 of them, voices of different aspects of his own personality, each of them given a name of its own.

The statue of the poet is in front of the café "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_A_Brasileira" target="_blank">A Brasileira</a>" in Rua Garrett. My hotel was next door and I took the image immediately before getting down into the Underground and out to the airport. This is my last image from Lisbon.
