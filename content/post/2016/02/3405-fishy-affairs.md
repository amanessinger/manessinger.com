Here's another shop, this time something fishy. 

Yes, I know, the focus should be on the eye and it is not. It's on the sign in the background, because I wanted to make sure that the letters are tack sharp. My fault, precisely focusing somewhere in between would have done the trick, but that's the problem with photographing on journeys. You better nail it, for you can't come back.

Still, I like the composition well enough to bother you with it ðŸ™‚
