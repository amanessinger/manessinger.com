<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schladming" target="_blank">Schladming</a> is one of those places in Austria where high-profile ski world cup races take place. It's among the likes of Kitzb√ºhl and Sankt Anton am Arlberg. It's less glamorous than the other two, but it is famous nevertheless.

I was there on my way to the monastery that we'll visit in the next post. I've never been there and it was exactly the right time and place for lunch.

Sitting outside, waiting for my meal, I noticed the sign of a photographer's shop, a mural on the side wall of the house, and I found it sufficiently interesting to dedicate a post to it.

Thus: if you're ever in Schladming and you need a photo to be taken of you, Foto Kaserer is the place.
