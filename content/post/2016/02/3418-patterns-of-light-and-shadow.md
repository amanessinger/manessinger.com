Being in a mundane environment has many advantages as well. For instance you see what you see over and again in always different lighting situations. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150928_163034_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150928_163034_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Time of the day, angle of the sun, weather, seasons, really, don't expect that you can always come back if you miss an image. It may take years until you see the same constellation again.

On the other hand, it may be worth trying, and still being there the next day at least gives you an option.
