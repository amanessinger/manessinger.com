The funny thing is, that at first I thought we were too late. A sign at the entrance to the monastery complex indicated that we had missed the second and last guided tour by an hour. I would never have thought that we could be admitted outside of a guided tour at all.

Well, never give up without trying. Not only were we allowed to roam freely, for a fee I was also given a photo permit! 

By the way, if you're interested in what a professional can do in such a location, just have a look at <a href="http://www.vonwong.com/blog/stiftadmont/" target="_blank">this blog</a> ðŸ™‚
