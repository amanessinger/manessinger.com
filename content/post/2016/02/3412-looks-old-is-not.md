The Benedictine monastery Admont was where I was heading. The abbey was founded in 1074, but in 1865 an enormous fire destroyed almost all of it. Unlike other, similar cases, the monastery was rebuilt though. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2015/20150912_154523_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2015/20150912_154523_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> To be honest, the church looks new. Somehow the patina is missing, and although it is not apparent upon first view, a feeling of fake is always present. Nevertheless, the architecture is pretty impressing. You'll see more of it in the next post.
