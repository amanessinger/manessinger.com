Today we are in Villach, the place where I live now in Carinthia. It's only 35&nbsp;km west of Klagenfurt, the town where I was born, but it has much better weather and less fog.

This is the wall of a local cinema with a sign that keeps us from parking across the firefighter's entrance. I like the symmetry of the composition along with the asymmetry of the shadow pattern.

No idea what movie I saw ðŸ™‚
