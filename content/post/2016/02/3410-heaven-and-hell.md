Back again in Klagenfurt, the town where I was born. Today is February 13, 2016. These images were taken on September 7 last year. That's how long it has taken us to get through the Lisbon portfolio. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as I did.

Why exactly I've been in Klagenfurt and why exactly I've been in that church, honestly I can't remember any more. It wouldn't make much of a difference though, I assume.
