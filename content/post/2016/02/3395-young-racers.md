Directly below the Miradouro there is a park. It's a fine place to stop at a kiosk and enjoy a sip of white wine. Well, it was only from a plastic cup, but nevertheless it was nice.

The light was already low and golden, and of course I couldn't resist taking a few more images. I like this one for the perfect position of the young man and for the way the edge of the cloud mirrors the way through the park ðŸ™‚
