Here we are on top of a hill again. This time it's Miradouro da Senhora do Monte, the viewpoint of the Lady of the Mountain. The church to the left, that's Igreja da Gra√ßa. We've been there, you may remember the cross-bearing Christ. The other hill is the castle hill. 

I've tried to make another panorama up there, but somehow I lost interest. It would have been into the not yet setting and still blinding sun. I can't imagine it would have been any good.
