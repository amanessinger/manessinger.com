Nursing leave. Nothing to worry about, but I suppose it may keep me in Carinthia for the rest of the week.<br/><br/>I just read that <a href="http://1-photo-a-day.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Janine</a>, commenting on yesterday's rain image, hopes for an even higher level of summer, but at least for today I have to disappoint her: It still rains and if at all possible, it is even less inviting than yesterday.<br/><br/>After all that <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> action I try to catch up with blog reading, and yesterday night I read Mark "The Landscapist" Hobson. This is always amusing, because Mark is not only a brilliant photographer, he is also never shy of confrontation. Of course he found fault in <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html" target="_blank">Mike Johnston's advice</a> to aspiring photographers, to only use a Leica, a single lens and B&amp;W film of a single type for a year. Actually it's <a href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/journal/2009/5/29/hardscapes-4-if-you-want-to-grow-apples-plant-apples-seeds-n.html" target="_blank">not so incredibly much fault</a> that he found, but it's enough for a heated debate. Many people may take offense at Mark's sometimes slightly aggressive style, but I love it. Here is a man who has strong opinions, grounded in great knowledge and long experience, who fiercely defends them and who is a talented and witty writer as well. It's not for the timid, but it's deeply enjoyable ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Why I mention Mark? Oh, only because he is the Master of the Square, and every time I'm exposed to his imagery, I feel a strong temptation to get square as well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Image of the Day was taken this morning out of the rear window of tram line 18 in Vienna, just before I reached Vienna South Station. Think of it as of "<a href="/2009/01/826-goin-down-slow.html">826 - Goin' Down Slow</a>" under adverse conditions ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Travelin' Man" by Anita O'Day. I have it on disc 2 of the 4 CD collection "Young Anita". <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/342256" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has a version on the album "Let Me Off Uptown", no idea if it's the same recording. I can't check it at the moment. Anyway. Anita is never a bad choice.
