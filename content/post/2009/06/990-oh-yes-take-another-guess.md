When I left work late in the afternoon, we had traces of sunshine mixed with some raindrops, and halfway that turned into a constant drizzle. Oh well, it IS worse north of the alps.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090629_085028_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090629_085028_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The first image is from the morning. I had just left the Underground station. So ... you think your camera's got a big, heavy battery, huh? Loser! That's a big battery ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I suppose electricity in the Underground station had failed and they came with the big truck to our rescue: 400 kVA!! That's a battery.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090629_170238_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090629_170238_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The next image is from the afternoon, near my workplace. This is a garbage container of some construction company, and the sign on it reads "<span style="font-style: italic;">Please don't fill in refrigerators and PC monitors</span>". I wonder if they take TV sets or sofas ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> I used the Nikon 24/2.8 for all images. Post-processing is similar to what I did the last days, <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/topazadjust" target="_blank">Topaz Adjust</a> and <a href="http://www.alienskin.com/" target="_blank">Snap Art</a>. The exact settings, which Snap Art effect I use, how much I modify it, which Topaz effect I use, whether I add lines made with Snap Art "Stylize" or not, what kind of masks I use, the opacity values, all that varies from image to image, thus it wouldn't make much sense to create an action. It's more of a pattern than an algorithm.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.hotlyrics.net/lyrics/E/Ella_Fitzgerald/Oh_Yes__Take_Another_Guess.html" target="_blank">Oh Yes, Take Another Guess</a>" by Ella Fitzgerald. I have it on a 10 CD box of her early recordings, that is most probably not available outside of Austria, Germany and probably Switzerland, but you find the song on many compilations, e.g. "Ella And Her Fellas". <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/290801" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the album, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuV5N3YL7Qg" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has a video.
