What I like though, is the post-processing. Black and white is so incredibly forgiving in these high-contrast situations where you have to re-map tones wildly. There are a lot of small, local tonal adjustments in it, and the result quite pleases me. Technically that is. Oh well!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dianakrall/walkonby.html" target="_blank">Walk On By</a>", this time not by Cake as in "<a href="/2007/04/188-walk-on-by.html" target="_blank">188 - Walk on By</a>", this time it's Diana Krall on her new Bossa Nova inspired album "Quiet Nights". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQifvB4lwyM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
