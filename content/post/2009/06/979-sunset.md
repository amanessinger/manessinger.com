It turned out to be an excellent idea, because today weather was rainy and at least in Vienna it's supposed to stay that way. At the moment I am on the train to Carinthia, there it's still sunny, with at least some chances for a sunny weekend. If not, we could always make a trip to Italy.<br/><br/> This week I recognized that I had ripped no more than 50% of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive" so far, and so I added another 20 CDs, thus I have 104 of 168 discs done now.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "Sunset" by jazz saxophonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Stitt" target="_blank">Sonny Stitt</a>, is on one of them, it's from disc 99.<br/><br/> You may probably prefer to buy a single CD instead of 168 (though you miss the bargain of your life). If so, "Sonny Stitt/Bud Powell/J.J. Johnson" is for you. It has exactly the same version of the song and <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/124830" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the whole album for you to hear.
