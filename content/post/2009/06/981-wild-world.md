I should have risen early, because we had sunshine in the morning. Oh well, we'll see what I get for today, but let's postpone to for the next entry ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> This is one image from yesterday's short trip down to Italy. We wanted to escape the bad weather in Carinthia, and escape we did.<br/><br/>The image was taken from the yard of the church of Cesclans.
