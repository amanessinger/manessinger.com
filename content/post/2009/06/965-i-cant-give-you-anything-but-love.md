It wouldn't make sense with the shallow DOF and all the blur that I've added in post-processing. We won't discuss my new Tokina 11-16/2.8 either. In fact, it's 2:30am, that is too late to discuss anything at all.<br/><br/> Let's instead shortly talk about music. The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/louis_armstrong/i_cant_give_you_anything_but_love.html" target="_blank">I Can't Give You Anything But Love</a>", has been recorded by practically everyone, and of course Louis Armstrong would not be out of place here, but instead we cross the Atlantic and enter pre-WWII Paris. <br/><br/>On May 4, 1936, the Quintette du Hot Club de France performs: Stephane Grappelli on violin, Django Reinhardt on guitar, trumpet player Freddy Taylor sings. Arguably one of the more spectacular versions in Jazz history ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I have it on disc 74 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", and I'm sure there are plenty of other options to get it on disc, but I am too tired to look them up now. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUW317lGXI0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
