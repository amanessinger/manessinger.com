What crisis? Or do I have one? Fact is, that this lens does not inspire me at all. Not on normal, bright early summer days.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090610_082229_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090610_082229_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I can really blame it on the long minimum focusing distance. While I can do magic things with the Sigma 20/1.8, a much longer lens, everything that I do with this Tokina 11-16/2.8 comes out boring. It's not that I want to sell it, but I wouldn't recommend it either. At least not to someone who shares my lust for exotic lenses ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Again: this is a good lens. In fact it's a marvelous lens. It is only that it currently bores me to death.<br/><br/>At the moment I am on the train to Carinthia, tomorrow I'll have to work a little in the apartment, but then I'll be on a short two-day trip to Italy. I will stay for a night in a hotel by the sea. Let's have a look at how the Tokina performs in a more traditional landscape environment. We'll see.<br/><br/> Oh, by the way, I'm writing this on the new laptop and it's positively a pleasure. And the probably coolest effect is: I'm finally down to a single backpack, my trusty Lowepro Rover Plus AW. It's pretty full, and when it's full, it's heavy, even with the new Vaio, but on the other hand, I am carrying a DSLR with five lenses, a laptop with power supply, a wash bag, a book and an umbrella. This may have some weight ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>In any case, not having to carry a separate laptop bag any more, that's fantastic!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eurythmics/the_last_time.html" target="_blank">The Last Time</a>" from the 1986 Eurythmics album "Revenge".
