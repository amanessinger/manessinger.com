At least that's what it's supposed to be.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090622_084210_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090622_084210_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> In reality it pours down like mad, it is relatively cool and the weather forecast mentions snow lines. They are in a very safe distance above us, but at this time of the year even the idea of snow is obscene ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Anyway. It is as it is. The bicycle detail was shot in the morning. Uhhh ... "<a href="http://photomusings.wordpress.com/2009/06/07/shoot/" target="_blank">shot</a>" again? Oh well, maybe it's OK to shoot bicycle details, as long as nobody else gets hurt ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Image of the Day shows the impressive summer situation that I encountered when I left work early. For both images I used the Nikon 24/2.8, a lens that I selected because I knew I would not have to struggle with flares and ghosts anyway. It's a very relaxing change from the Tokina 11-16/2.8, because again I can focus relatively near (still not as near as I like) and the focal length feels so incredibly natural.<br/><br/>Do you know that feeling, when you do something, that you used to do regularly and with pleasure, but have not done long since? That feeling of returning? Well, that's how it felt ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rem/summer_turns_to_high.html" target="_blank">Summer Turns To High</a>" from the 2001 R.E.M album "Reveal". Sorry, no video, I can't offer you more than Amazon's sound sample.
