Still, originally I wanted to make the purchase later in autumn, after Windows 7 has been released. Other than that, I was agonizing for months about what exactly to buy. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090609_151353_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090609_151353_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I didn't want to spend too much money. The logic was, that I have walked around with a heavy laptop for years, so obviously this was no problem. You know, size and weight, these are the two factors that determine the price of a laptop.<br/><br/>Or are they? Yesterday I spent half an hour in an electronics supermarket, comparing laptops, and I was pretty shocked. Most of them have very bad displays with low contrast, small viewing angles and small gamut. Most, but not the Macs. <br/><br/>Hmm ... one day I'll buy a Mac or two, but at the moment I am pretty tied to Windows, and of all the Windows laptops, only two had a decent display: a monster with 19" and weighing more than 4kg, and then the Sony Vaio Z11.<br/><br/> On those B&amp;W images you see me on the train, speeding down to MÃ¶dling, one of Vienna's suburbs. A dealer there had a very good price for the Sony Vaio Z21, the successor to the Z11, and now I have such a beast. Core 2 Duo, 2.4 GHz, 4GB memory, a wonderful non-glare display with high contrast and wide gamut, 1366x768, weighing only 1.5kg. Yup! That's more like a Photoshop machine ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lou_reed/im_so_free.html" target="_blank">I'm So Free</a>" from Lou Reed's classic 1972 album Transformer.
