You know that feeling? Running in circles? Well, I certainly did at work, and all I had at the end of the day, was a profound knowledge of why some approaches to my problem are dead ends ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Anyway. I did not take too many images either. Weather was mediocre in the morning, far from inspiring in the afternoon, and apart from that, time was short. All I've got is this slightly penile object with a profoundly blue base ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Oh, and the sticker reads "Kunst", which is the German word for "art".<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Profoundly Blue" by jazz clarinetist and band leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Hall" target="_blank">Edmond Hall</a>. I have it on disc 31 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", but of course you can get it on a single CD as well. If you love Jazz though, you should really consider this big box, regardless of its not unsubstantial price. You get 168 CDs and I guarantee, you'll learn a lot ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/290111" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the Song for you to hear.
