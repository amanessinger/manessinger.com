This is one of a series of images that I took while being on the train. I pointed the camera out of the window, in different directions, in angles that I thought could probably make for an interesting image, and from that series of essentially random images I got at least this one.<br/><br/>In the meantime, after one and a half days in Vienna, I'm on the train back to Carinthia. Tomorrow night we'll see an opera in Graz. Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the great Austrian master of Baroque music directs, no, not Purcell, not Haendel, not Bach, he directs Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess". More about that tomorrow night or Thursday.<br/><br/> Btw, while I sit here on the train and look through dirty windows, outside is fantastic weather, golden light, a sky mixed with blue and scattered clouds. It's pure masochism to even look out of the window. Oh well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the Elvis song "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/neville_brothers/mystery_train.html" target="_blank">Mystery Train</a>", interpreted by the Neville Brothers on their 1990 album "Brother's Keeper".
