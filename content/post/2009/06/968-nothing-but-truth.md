Elections to the European Parliament that were, and though it didn't go well, it could have been much worse. Throughout Europe the trend was harshly against the social democrats, overall the green party seems to have won moderately while the nationalist populists, though strong in some countries (Austria among them), have lost a bit. The conservatives are by far the leading force in Europe now.<br/><br/>After voting in the early afternoon, I tried to make some images, most of them, like this forest image, from under an umbrella, and while I quite like the image, I decided to add some city night shots after my arrival in Vienna. <br/><br/> This was the first time that I've used the new Tokina 11-16/2.8 at night in the city, and the truth is: It is a night lens! Using it at night is pure pleasure. The image in the viewfinder is bright and exposure times are very moderate. The Image of the Day was shot at 11mm, f2.8, 0.4s and ISO 3200. Believe me, it was dark ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsreg.com/lyrics/lila+downs/Nothing+But+The+Truth/" target="_blank">Nothing But The Truth</a>" from the 2008 Lila Downs album "Shake Away", as far as I know, the first album that she has recorded in New York.
