Well, at least it was meant to be short, but one should never underestimate Slovenia's small mountain roads. At least this time we were not <a href="/2009/03/869-river-deep-mountain-high-ii.html" target="_blank">bucked off</a> ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/urban_dreams_i" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/misc/urban-dreams-i-big.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> It took me so long to post that image, because in the meantime I have made a book. No, it is not "<a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/books/amanessinger/urban-dreams-ii/" target="_blank">Urban Dreams II</a>", my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> book, but it is the promised "Urban Dreams I", made of most images of last years exhibition, along with some other images that I thought would fit.<br/><br/>I used the Adobe InDesign template, that I have created for this year's SoFoBoMo. The book was made in about six hours. Of course the images were all ready to be taken, and most of the time went into finding a sequence with a certain flow, writing the introduction and, most tedious, writing the captions. Clicking on the thumbnail will bring you to <a href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/urban_dreams_i" target="_blank">Issuu.com</a>, where I have uploaded the book.<br/><br/> As there is much concern about file sizes on the SoFoBoMo blogs, I can tell you that at least with InDesign you should have no problem. This book contains 46 images, two of them twice, I have not resized the images, I have just dragged the final JPEGs into InDesign graphics frames. Upon export, I have used the "High Quality Print" preset and only changed the image quality settings from the default of "Maximum" to "High". The resulting PDF is still no bigger than 13MB and the image quality is absolutely satisfying.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/supremes/mountain_greenery.html" target="_blank">Mountain Greenery</a>", this time not by Mel TormÃ©, this time it's the great Ella Fitzgerald. I have it in a box of her complete songbook recordings (which is very recommendable), but of course the Rodgers &amp; Hart Songbook is also available separately. YouTube has a very nice 1979 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iADhV0NbIF8" target="_blank">live video</a>.
