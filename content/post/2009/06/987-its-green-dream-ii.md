I used a short period of sunshine, to go swimming and make some images. This is another experiment with the new plugins: <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/topazadjust" target="_blank">Topaz Adjust</a> and <a href="http://www.alienskin.com/" target="_blank">Snap Art</a>. It is clear now that I will buy both. I still have to look into the other Topaz plugins, Clean and Simplify may be useful in some situations.<br/><br/> I always use these effects in separate layers, combine different effects from the same or different filters, and use varying opacities, sometimes dependent on tonal value (Blend-If sliders) and masks. You see, I'm pretty much afraid of using canned effects and producing generic looks ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_conte/its_a_green_dream.html" target="_blank">It's A Green Dream</a>" from Paolo Conte's 2000 album "Razmataz". This time I have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HbWTpOTKkA" target="_blank">video</a> for you. Love this song!
