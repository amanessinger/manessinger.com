He made me do it. I swear!<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090617_082142_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090617_082142_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> You may have seen Ted's <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/search/label/Alien-Skin" target="_blank">recent experiments</a> with the <a href="http://www.alienskin.com/" target="_blank">Alien Skin</a> plugin Snap Art.<br/><br/>Well, we had some conversation about the merits of said software, and - without having tried it - I uttered my concerns that these were simply some canned effects, that everything made with it would look like Ted's recent works.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090617_173947_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090617_173947_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Maybe not. Since then I have installed the plugin (along with "Bokeh" and the whole "<a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/" target="_blank">Topaz</a>" plugin bundle), have experimented a little, and I can see ways to put at least Snap Art to use. By the way, "Snap Art" is an incredibly stupid name, obviously catering to the non-artist crowd that may at times want to produce "something artsy".<br/><br/> In reality this plugin is incredibly configurable. You have lots of pre-configured effects, but then you can begin to twist the parameters to your liking. And of course you can combine different effects with layers, blending modes and opacities.<br/><br/>The images shown here were made in reverse order. The Bamboo restaurant is the earliest, maybe still looking a little byrnesque, the street image looks more like where I wanted to go, and the Image of the Day finally has the composition as well.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tina_turner/come_together.html" target="_blank">Come Together</a>". We had the Beatles version in "<a href="/2007/04/171-come-together.html" target="_blank">171 - Come Together</a>", this time it must be Ike &amp; Tina Turner.
