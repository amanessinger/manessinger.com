Nice Sunday activity, I tell you ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Well, you and I have not missed anything. Weather was a mixture of dense, dark clouds, dense dark clouds with rain and not so dark but still dense clouds without rain. Only in the evening I have considered going swimming one more time. I did not, because time is short and I am off to Vienna in the evening. Instead I'm writing this entry.<br/><br/> This is another image from yesterday. Seeing what the weather was, I have already processed it in the morning. It's a composite of two vertical exposures that both were a bit off of my intended composition. The place is again old grounds, and the processing uses the same tools as yesterday, <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/topazadjust" target="_blank">Topaz Adjust</a> and <a href="http://www.alienskin.com/" target="_blank">Snap Art</a>, along with various masks and opacity settings.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "One More Time, Chick Corea" by the 1970s German A-Capella band Singers Unlimited. I have a 7 CD boxed set called "Magic Voices", and you can also get the song on a cheaper 2 CD collection called "Complete A Capella Sessions", mind though, that these sessions are far from complete ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Go to <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/102571" target="_blank">Deezer</a> to hear them. You won't regret it.
