I've slept the night on the balcony and woke up on 6:30am, just in time to take a series of images of a beautiful sunrise through the window of my study, a view that you have seen so often now, a view that still always changes.<br/><br/> Well, this time it was particularly precious, because that was pretty much the last sun for today. It does not rain yet, but the forecast for the whole week speaks of clouds, rain and snow lines. Yikes!<br/><br/>I have no idea what I will do the next days. Maybe I'll do some macro shots. Pretty good idea, given that I have my macro flash equipment here in Carinthia ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Sunday Mornings", originally from Mary Coughlan's 1987 album "Under The Influence", but because that album currently seems to be pretty unavailable, I link to her "Platinum Collection". Sorry, no lyrics, but <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/82888" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the whole collection for you to hear.
