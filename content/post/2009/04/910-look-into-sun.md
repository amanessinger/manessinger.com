Badly need it? By a substantial amount maybe? I did. <br/><br/>No problem in Photoshop, the only thing is, that you lose a big amount of your image when you crop it back into the frame. The bigger the angle, the more you lose. Rotating by, say, 15 degrees is absolutely out of the question. Well, this is my solution ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The music for today is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/look_into_the_sun.html" target="_blank">Look Into The Sun</a>", originally from the 1969 Jethro Tull album "Stand Up", but today's live version, the special version for the elderly among us, is from the fabulous 1992 album "A Little Light Music". Enjoy it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiOWvkTjClQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Well, OK, if you must have it: here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DMUAI2Cp6g&hl=de" target="_blank">original</a> as well ðŸ™‚
