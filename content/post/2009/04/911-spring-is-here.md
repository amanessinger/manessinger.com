It has haunted us for almost eight years now. It has been abused to introduce the worst backlash against freedom of expression that our western civilization in the so-called free countries had to endure since the totalitarian downfall in the 1920/30s.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship" target="_blank">Censorship</a>, the wet dream of every totalitarian mind, has returned as a concept openly pursued by our governments. <a href="http://www.ncac.org/" target="_blank">Don't let them have it</a>!<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090410_064310_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090410_064310_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Sorry, seeing the number of today's (well, actually yesterday's) entry has put me in agitation mode again. Still, it's something to consider. Freedom is either a collective experience or it is not at all. Let's get back to normal, can we?<br/><br/>Other than agitating, today I want to begin with two forgotten images from Friday. The first is the morning view out of my window in Vienna.<br/><br/>There is so much contrast, it is impossible to capture the feeling in any normal image ... and still, I experience that feeling every sunny spring morning. Here I have used a very flat conversion from RAW and then applied some Hue/Saturation layers in various blending modes, "Screen" being among them in the darker parts. You can get to the same result via Lab mode color steepening, this is just the way I do it now. I guess it looks quite OK, at least my feeling is there.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090410_125556_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090410_125556_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The second is actually a variation on "<a href="/2008/06/602-day-that-jackie-jumped-jail.html">602 - The Day That Jackie Jumped The Jail</a>". It's the same place, the same escalator, there is still a construction site, I used the same lens, only this time I am maybe a meter above the position last time, and this time I have used <a href="http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_hemi.asp" target="_blank">Fisheye-Hemiâ„¢</a> for distortion correction. The other image was more evocative, at least for me, but I like this enough that I had to show you.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090411_120756_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090411_120756_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> All of today's images were shot with the Nikon 10.5/2.8 fisheye, all were treated with Fisheye-Hemi. Actually I love the way this plugin works. You have to work with some restrictions, most important the fact that the plugin does not honor the EXIF image orientation information and always corrects for landscape format, but all of photography is governed by restrictions, lens choice is a restriction, so get over that. Think of it as a software that turns your fisheye into a landscape lens. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090411_154937_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090411_154937_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> And an ultra-ultra-wide at that. Remember: verticals will be corrected and will behave just like with any ultra-wide. When you point the lens up- or downward, they will show strong perspective distortion. Horizontals will not be corrected at all.<br/><br/> If you use the fisheye in the most tame way, keeping the horizon in the middle, as I did in the last image, it is just a very, very wide lens.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nina_simone/spring_is_here.html" target="_blank">Spring Is Here</a>" by Nina Simone. It's funny that I have never used that song. If you look at the lyrics, it's the opposite of what I actually feel, but the song is really beautiful. I have it on "The Tomato Collection", a collection that, according to Amazon, is discontinued by the publisher, but that you can still get via Amazon marketplace, or if you are open to digital downloads, directly from Amazon. <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/205279" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the whole double album for you to enjoy.
