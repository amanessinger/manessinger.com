The rules say you must keep your shadow out of the image, and what did I? A minute I let my attention slip and somehow it must have sneaked into the image ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090407_062702_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090407_062702_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Wow, how I love this early summer weather that has come over us, just a week after the last snow fell in Villach! <br/><br/>Vienna is always about two weeks ahead of Carinthia, at least in spring, and here the trees are already budding, people go in summer clothes, the days are long again and color has come back into the world.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090407_063741_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090407_063741_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Today my color is yellow. A warm yellow, and that's just how I feel. I have used the Nikon 24/2.8 today, I wanted it a little "wider" ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I really like to use it, although it is not a good lens by today's standards. Sure, it's sharp, no problem with that, CA is there but not a problem either, bokeh is nothing to write home about, but it is not worse than with the average zoom, no, the problem are the reflections.<br/><br/> Boy, if you even remotely have the sun in your frame (or at night any strong light), you get a strong reflection from the sensor to the inside of the lens, and then as a strong emerald ghost back to the sensor. Eeek! Well, it's not really a problem on DX format, because you can easily shade it off with your hand without causing vignetting, but I guess on FX format it must be painful.<br/><br/>This is something that typically occurs with old lens designs stemming from film days. Film was much less reflective than those silver sensors, and therefore the problem did not exist. Today's lenses use a special anti-reflective coating on the inside, but my Nikon 24/2.8 was made sometime in the early 1990s. Oh well, no real problem, just a reason to be careful, and I just stop complaining. Who would, on a day like this ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/memphis_slim/i_see_my_great_mistake.html" target="_blank">I See My Great Mistake</a>" by Memphis Slim. I have it on that wonderful 169 CD collection "The Ultimate Jazz Archive". Sorry, no video, but <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/43812" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the song.
