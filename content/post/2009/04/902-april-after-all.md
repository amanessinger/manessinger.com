Deep Purple's masterpiece "April" is about gray skies that should be blue, and the song that I finally decided to use, "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/ron-sexsmith-april-after-all-lyrics.html" target="_blank">April After All</a>" from the Anne Sofie von Otter / Elvis Costello collaboration "For The Stars", tries to comfort us with the vision of a passing April leading into May and June.<br/><br/>It's still a beautiful song. Hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejrr50oT3Uw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090402_161737_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090402_161737_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Anyway. This April definitely starts out fine. My firefighter work on that project is over, work gets enjoyable again, it's warm and sunny, and the days are long again. Today I even managed to squeeze in a short deviation to the back waters of river Danube. What can I say? It was a pleasure ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Out of a whim I decided to use the Nikon 24/2.8, and all color images were made using a polarizer. Makes a big difference in the Image of the Day and an even bigger difference with the swan.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090402_165612_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090402_165612_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The Image of the Day should really be this one, at least it is the only one that rises above the level of vacation snaps, but, you know, I really wanted to show off some different colors, some change of mood. Hope you enjoy it.<br/><br/>What's your view of April? Actually, now that I think of it, this is incredibly dependent on location. On the southern hemisphere, April corresponds to our October, near the equator it may make not much difference (does it?) and in some of the hotter countries on the northern hemisphere it may be the most pleasurable time of the year. But, what do I know? Tell me about it: What does April mean for you?
