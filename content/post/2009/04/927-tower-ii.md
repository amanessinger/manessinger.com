This is an image taken yesterday afternoon. It did not rain, but that is about all that can be said in favor of that day ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>The church of Maria Gail is just on the other side of the river, five minutes from here by car. It perches on a small hill, overlooking river Gail.<br/><br/> In weather like that, B&amp;W is always a good idea, because it takes quite some contrast manipulations to get an even slightly decent image, and in B&amp;W it is much easier to stretch an image beyond the point where in color it would lose its credibility.<br/><br/>This is the second time that I use "The Tower" as title, "<a href="/2008/05/587-tower.html" target="_blank">587 - The Tower</a>" was the first time, but it is the first time that Leonard Cohen's "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/tower_of_song.html" target="_blank">Tower Of Song</a>" is the Song of the Day. See him perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BOKCil8kdw&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. This clip is from the 2008 tour, but there are dozens from all phases of his career. Pick your favorite ðŸ™‚
