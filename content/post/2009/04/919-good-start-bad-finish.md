The promised rain has finally got us today.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090419_160323_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090419_160323_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The sunrise was OK, even quite beautiful, I might say, but from then on the weather went rapidly down the drain. In the afternoon I was shortly out to fetch some things, and from the car I made this image. <br/><br/> The hump on the hill are the ruins of castle Landskron, the one that featured prominently in "<a href="/2009/04/905-from-out-of-nowhere.html" target="_blank">905 - From Out Of Nowhere</a>". Yes, yes, I know, one should not take photographs while driving ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jimi_hendrix/still_raining_still_dreaming.html" target="_blank">Still Raining, Still Dreaming</a>" from the 1968 Jimi Hendrix album "Electric Ladyland".
