Boy, this lens is heavy, but on the other hand, it feels really well balanced on the D300. <br/><br/> Chromatic aberrations are very tame, distortions are well controlled, and if I really need to make the crooked straight, it's of course supported by <a href="http://epaperpress.com/ptlens/" target="_blank">PTLens</a>. It's not really necessary though. I didn't care to correct them in this image, regardless of the multitude of straight lines. Looks pretty good to me.<br/><br/>Btw: the blur and the vignette were added in post-processing. Just in case you wonder ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/lay_down_your_weary_tune.html" target="_blank">Lay Down Your Weary Tune</a>" from the Bob Dylan compilation "Biograph". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf_sPPmkN04" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
