In fact I did not, and I was already determined to use one image from the archives. <br/><br/>Just as I was about to sit down and browse my images of lately, I looked out of the window and saw a cloud looming over the mountains behind the ruins of castle <a href="http://www.burg-landskron.at/default.aspx?SIID=15&LAID=2" target="_blank">Landskron</a>. Hmm ... strong oblique lines, the castle at the bottom, the cloud in the upper right corner ... it looked like a composition.<br/><br/>I mounted the Nikon 70-300 VR, and really, its magnification was just enough to fill the whole frame with what I had imagined. But, oh my, the contrast! Imagine one of those wonderful, warm, sunny days that have only one problem: haze at the horizon. The image had very low contrast and the shadows had a sickly bluish cast.<br/><br/>Like always, even when I know that I'm going to B&amp;W in the end, I tried it in color first. With two different versions from RAW, selective Photoshop photofilters applied and with some selective color manipulation, I managed to get an image that would be OK for documentary purposes. Nothing special, but the colors were not too bad.<br/><br/>That was the basis for the B&amp;W conversion. It's always easier to convert from healthy colors, because this way the B&amp;W adjustment layer gives you many more possibilities.<br/><br/> The rest is my usual B&amp;W process, with only one twist: The slightly mottled look was created with two strong contrast curves layers, each at 50% opacity, one in luminosity mode, one in normal blending mode, and each having a mask created with "Filter / Render / Clouds". I have used two different masks for the two layers, in order to make the effect a little less obvious, and the two different blending modes were used to get a certain amount of contrast with a little bit of color shift, but not as much as one 100% layer in normal mode would have yielded. Well, that's it: a Sunday image from out of nowhere. It's not a masterpiece, but, hey, shooting it cost me only a minute and I could stay at home ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "From Out Of Nowhere" from "Inquisition Symphony", the Finnish heavy metal string quartet Apocalyptica's 1998 second album.
