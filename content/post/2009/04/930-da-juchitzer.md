I know - and I do not care.<br/><br/>Today, after the rain, I was out shooting in the afternoon, I made some decent shots of trees and meadows and rurals ways and ...<br/><br/> ... forget it. Let's say I explored a new reservoir of images that I'll be exploiting soon enough, and - being there - I found a flock of deer that nicely succumbed to the magic of my 70-300.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "Da Juchitzer" by Hubert von Goisern and Sabine "Zabine" Kapfinger is not particularly connected to this image, but it is one of the best and at the same time one of the most popular examples of a kind of music that transforms traditional, rural Austrian music into a piece art of our time.<br/><br/>I have it on the 1995 live album "Wia Die Zeit Vergeht", a german phrase meaning "As Time Goes By". See a live performance on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOvR68EJRLM&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. And while you are at it, why not see HvG singin along <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt8k6U_7u60&feature=related" target="_blank">with Bobby McFerrin</a>?
