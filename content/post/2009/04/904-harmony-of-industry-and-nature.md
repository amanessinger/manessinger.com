It ain't one, but it describes a feeling that I had when I saw this scene. <br/><br/>Btw, this image is mostly unedited. Nothing was cloned out or in, even the sky gradient was made the analog way by using two Lee soft split ND filters held in front of the lens. I have them in the car, rarely use them, but yesterday I remembered ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Mostly I have set the white balance, pumped up saturation and sharpened the image. White balance is set to give a slight magenta cast. That's how I wanted it. It looks a little bit unnatural, but in a way that you find in many illustrations. Unnatural, but familiar. I like that look and it makes a good match for the late-afternoon light.<br/><br/>"Industry", "Industrial", well, that triggers the association with Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails. Blixa Bargeld and EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten would have been the other logical option, but today it's NIN. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "1 Ghosts I", the first track of the first part of "Ghosts I-IV", the album that NIN released in 2008, a quarter of it ("Ghosts I") as a free download, the whole album first for download from their website and later on media via the normal channels. <br/><br/>It's the same concept that recently worked well for David Byrne and Brian Eno ("Everything That Happens Will Happen Today"), but here it comes with a welcome twist: <br/><br/> "Ghosts I-IV" has been released under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a> license, and that actually means you can take the music, remix it and use it in your own works, as long as you don't use it commercially. You can share the original music and your derivative works based upon it, under the condition that any derivative work is released under the same license and that the attribution chain is not broken. Pretty nice, I'd say.<br/><br/>"Ghosts I-IV" can be heard on the web (in random order though), and it can be bought as download in the formats MP3, <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec) and Apple Lossless. The latter two are full CD quality and no files have been harmed by <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/" target="_blank">DRM</a>. I have opted for the FLAC download. Go to the <a href="http://ghosts.nin.com/" target="_blank">Ghosts website</a>, listen, download and/or order.
