Art is no democracy, but the wise artist heeds the voice of the public, even more so, when it's really ONE voice. "<span style="font-style:italic;">Post-apocalyptic</span>"! Guys, you really know how to motivate me. Hope you don't mind when I choose to still pursue that way ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><div style="float: right;"><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090412_143515_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090412_143515_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090412_155032_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090412_155032_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></div> Slovenia advertises with the slogan "The Sunny Side of the Alps", and they are quite right. From Carinthia it's only once over a mountain range (actually through a tunnel nowadays), and from Villach it takes me no more than about 15 minutes to reach the country, but at least in Spring and Summer, the climate is slightly warmer, the vegetation at least a week ahead.<br/><br/>On Sunday afternoon we took a <a href="http://maps.google.at/maps/ms?client=firefox-a&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=108716966416095170910.000467868679b40d57b45&amp;ll=46.336499,14.456635&amp;spn=0.898847,2.114868&amp;z=10" target="_blank">short trip down to Slovenia</a>, and to be precise, along the river Sava from Slovenia's capital Ljubljana east to the small town of Litja.<br/><br/><div style="float: left;"><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090412_155921_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090412_155921_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090412_162312_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090412_162312_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></div> There are roads on both sides of the Sava. We took the smaller ones, those that are so small and have so little traffic, that we once saw people playing Badminton in the middle of the road.<br/><br/>I used two lenses on this trip, the Nikon 18-200 VR and the Nikon 10.5/2.8 fisheye, but all images shown here were made with the fish and "<a href="http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_hemi.asp" target="_blank">Fisheye-Hemiâ„¢</a>". It's simply more fun.<br/><br/>All of today's images began as color images, then I have applied my now already familiar B&amp;W process, and finally used a mask to reveal most but not all of the original color. It is very similar to yesterday's process that did not tickle your fancy, only more subtle ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "Down By The River", is once again from "<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?wgrefijh4od" target="_blank">The Hudson Branch EP</a>" by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thehudsonbranch" target="_blank">The Hudson Branch</a>, a music group based in Crystal Lake, Illinois. Three of their six members are Bienerts, and although I came to know  <a href="http://coreybienert.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Corey Bienert</a> as a photographer, he and his band make very good music as well. Head over to <a href="http://thehudsonbranch.com/" target="_blank">their site</a> and download some of their music. So far it's for free.
