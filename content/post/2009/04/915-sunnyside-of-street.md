We had a big server switch on one of the projects that I was on over the last years, lots of configuration changes, 30000 users affected by any possible outage. Made me kinda nervous. It may have sucked my creativity away. <br/><br/> All went well in the end ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>There is no typo in the title. The Song of the Day is not the 1930 Jazz standard "On the Sunny Side of the Street" that we had from the great Roberta Gambarini in "<a href="/2007/08/312-back-to-sunny-side.html">312 - Back to the Sunny Side</a>" and from Cyndi Lauper in "<a aiotitle="145 - Life can be so Sweet" href="/2007/03/145-life-can-be-so-sweet.html">145 - Life can be so Sweet</a>".<br/><br/>This is hard, drunken Irish folk, this is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pogues/the_sunnyside_of_the_street.html" target="_blank">The Sunnyside Of The Street</a>" from the 1990 Pogues album "Hell's Ditch". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBaKWLoFYmQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Cheers!
