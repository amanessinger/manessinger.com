I was lucky. Yesterday when I had to go to Klagenfurt, my hometown, and when I had to wait on the streets for more than an hour, it did just not rain. As soon as I was back in the car, it began to pour down.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090428_103931_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090428_103931_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Klagenfurt is actually a nice town. It has about 93000 inhabitants, and in the 25 years that I have not lived there, it has changed radically. There are many more restaurants, cafÃ©s and bars now, the patios and thoroughfares are opened to the public, and the general impression is that of a place where people live. Amazing.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090428_101849_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090428_101849_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Btw, the correct term for those thoroughfares is "Durchhaus". I was tempted to use it in the paragraph above, and as always, I wanted to look up an english term.<br/><br/>While searching on <a href="http://www.leo.org/" target="_blank">LEO</a>, the best online dictionary for German/English, German/French, German/Italian and German/Spanish (they even have German/Chinese, but I can't possibly judge that), I stumbled upon a link to the professional translator's forum <a href="http://www.proz.com/kudoz/2584874" target="_blank">ProZ</a>, and one advise was to not translate the word, but instead explain it. I was already determined to use one of the two quoted explanations <blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">... a house between two streets, with one or more courtyards connected by a thoroughfare, basically a shortcut between the streets, going right through the house</span>."</blockquote> when to my surprise I found out that the supplied link pointed back to one of my own blog posts, "<a href="/2006/11/33-hanging-gardens.html" target="_blank">33 - Hanging Gardens</a>", written way back in November 2006 ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090428_110614_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090428_110614_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Regardless of weather, photographing in Klagenfurt was a nice experience. I met a group of street musicians who played very, very well and had no problems with me taking pictures, and in the course of that hour, I constantly changed between the Nikon 70-300 VR, the Nikon 35/1.8 and the Nikon 10.5/2.8 fisheye.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090428_100230_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090428_100230_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The Image of the Day was obviously made with the fish, and then treated with <a href="http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_hemi.asp" target="_blank">Fisheye-Hemiâ„¢</a>, the same goes for the small place with the people.<br/><br/>The metal sculpture is actually a drinking fountain, taken at 70mm, and somehow I found that the metal looks much better in a conventional B&amp;W process.<br/><br/> The other two images were taken with the Nikon 35/1.8. The square with the water droplets is another fountain, basically a sheet of glass, and on one side water comes down like from a shower head, only that the nozzles are lined up in a distance of about 5cm from the glass. I have used speed priority (S) mode and 1/8000s at f1.8 to capture the droplets.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/deep_purple/pictures_of_home.html" target="_blank">Pictures Of Home</a>" from the 1972 Deep Purple album "Machine Head". <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/10052" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the album, and YouTube has - among many many others - a 1999 live version from The Royal Albert Hall, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ09NmtnCY0" target="_blank">together with the London Symphony Orchestra</a>.
