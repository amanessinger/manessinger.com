It's not very easy to pre-visualize what you will get. I have a general feeling for it now, but there are still many times when I am surprised by the outcome. Verticals and wild tilts don't seem to work well. This plugin is definitely made for horizontals or near-horizontals.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a bad idea to use this lens with bright, overcast skies. Suddenly you've got enormous contrast everywhere and lose all colors and details in the shadows. On the other hand. if you overexpose, you lose fine details at highlight edges, so if it tickles you to use the fish on such a day: just don't do it.<br/><br/> I did, and the net result was meager. This is the only survivor. I went down to that particular bus stop because that tree is in full blossom now and I missed it last year. Unfortunately B&amp;W was a necessity here for the aforementioned reasons. Damn it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/does_this_bus_stop_at_82nd_street.html" target="_blank">Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?</a>" from Bruce Springsteen's 1973 album "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.".
