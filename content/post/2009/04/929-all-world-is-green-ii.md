<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090429_145315_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2009/20090429_145315_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Yesterday it rained most of the time. I used a short pause in the afternoon to make some forest images.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090429_143422_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090429_143422_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I'd have more but, you know, it's forest ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I used a very expensive B&amp;W polarizer, and as always it turned out to be a lot of work in Photoshop to get it looking like I wanted it to. I think it was worth the effort though.<br/><br/>I am pretty proud of the second image as well. It's the 35/1.8 at f6.3 and 1/15s, handheld, and it is tack sharp.<br/><br/> I used this song once, <a href="/2008/05/576-all-world-is-green.html">almost a year ago</a>, but when it makes sense, why not make use of the powerful force of repetition :-?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is one again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/all_the_world_is_green.html" target="_blank">All The World Is Green</a>" from Tom Waits' 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Money-Tom-Waits/dp/B00005YX3K" target="_blank">Blood Money</a>". See him perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCbMw9oDgB0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. The video is the same as last year, only the link had stopped working, "due to terms of use violation". Let's hope they get tired of stupidly removing videos that sell their products. Well, at least this one has the complete interview with Letterman ðŸ™‚
