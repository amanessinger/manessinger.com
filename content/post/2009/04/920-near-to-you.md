Many more. I may add some of them to the next entry, but for now I need to go to work.<br/><br/> If today were SoFoBoMo, this would be the kind of images to go into "Urban Dream II". <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nina_simone/near_to_you.html" target="_blank">Near To You</a>" by the great Nina Simone. I have it on the two CD "Tomato Collection". <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/205279" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has it for you to hear, Amazon has the CDs via their marketplace, and they also have digital downloads.
