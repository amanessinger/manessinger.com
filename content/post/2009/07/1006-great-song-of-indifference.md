That's the starting point of the first such side-project, but I guess it need not be restricted to mirrors only.<br/><br/>The idea is more along the lines of "unusual or puzzling views", but the whole thing is so new, I won't even take that as a working title. Who knows, maybe I'll kill the project off in two days ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090715_083245_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090715_083245_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I got several images that I could have taken, this street scene is just one of them. Actually I selected it more because I really like what I could make of this low-contrast and noisy reflection in the dark rear window of a van.<br/><br/>Really, if there is one thing that those Snap Art filters are great at, then it must be their ability to make every image usable, regardless of technical quality.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was taken on the sidewalk in front of the same shop where I took the image of the <a href="/2009/05/948-hit-road-to-dreamland.html" target="_blank">mannequin</a>, that ended up near the end of this year's SoFoBoMo book "<a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/books/amanessinger/urban-dreams-ii/" target="_blank">Urban Dreams II</a>".<br/><br/> Again I have not used Snap Art in this image, but I have used the "Skin Even" filter in Topaz Clean. Basically that's a skin beautifier, that works great on females and most of the time not so great on males. Here I've used it with a mask and lowered opacity. And this reminds me that the trial periods for these filters will be over in a few days, and that I will have to part with some money. So far the shopping list contains Alien Skin Snap Art, Topaz Adjust and Topaz Clean.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_geldof/great_song_of_indifference.html" target="_blank">The Great Song Of Indifference</a>" by Bob Geldof. I have it on a collection called "Loudmouth: Best Of Bob Geldof &amp; The Boomtown Rats". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVBz9cHfII" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has a video.
