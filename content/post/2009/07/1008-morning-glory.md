Sorry for that, I ran pretty out of time. That's for quiet weekends ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> This image was taken Friday morning on my way to work. I actually thought all the time I would take another image, one of the current mirror series, but when it turned out worse than expected, I instead found that I really like this one for a certain quietude in it and for its composition in general.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/blood_sweat_tears/morning_glory.html" target="_blank">Morning Glory</a>" from the 1967 Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears debut album "Child Is Father to the Man".
