I'm in Vienna again and tired now, and by the way, did I mention it's late?<br/><br/> I took this image in the maybe two minutes that I had for photography today. It's a combination of two exposures, one at f5.6 for some depth, and one at f2.8 for the soft background.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cranberries/sunday.html" target="_blank">Sunday</a>" from the 1992 Cranberries album "Everybody Else is Doing It So Why Can't We?".
