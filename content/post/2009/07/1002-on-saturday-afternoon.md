Well, I eventually did, but it took me a hell of a time. Once I even fell in a shop, because the chair that I tested, had been wrongly assembled. I tried to lean back ... and suddenly the chair tilted over.<br/><br/>Actually that is not really funny. You sit in the chair, you lean back, and suddenly it topples over, and you feel like falling, and then you fall, and you try not to, but there is nothing in the world that you could do. You can only hope that you won't break your neck.<br/><br/> Well, I didn't, and I'm pretty glad about it. Now I'm sitting in a nice and comfortable new leather chair and all's well again.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was taken shortly afterward, while we sat in the garden of a pub nearby. While drinking a beer and relaxing, I saw this bicycle, the planks leaning against the shed, and I thought this could be a composition.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rickie_lee_jones/on_saturday_afternoons_in_1963.html" target="_blank">On Saturday Afternoons In 1963</a>" from Rickie Lee Jones' 1979 self-titled debut album. <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/86752" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the album, and on YouTube is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzoY-ofQBSI" target="_blank">video</a>, albeit with inferior sound quality.
