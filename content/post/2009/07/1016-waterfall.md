The idea was to take the "Triglavski cesta", the small road from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=mojstrana,+slovenia&sll=46.445309,13.942509&sspn=0.110003,0.263844&ie=UTF8&ll=46.445546,13.94062&spn=0.110002,0.263844&z=13&iwloc=A" target="_blank">Mojstrana</a>, a village between Kranjska Gora and Jesenice, south-west into the Triglav National Park.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090725_155453_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090725_155453_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I didn't have the time to take a long walk or even climb up Slovenia's highest mountain (2,864 meters), thus for us the road ended rather anticlimactic on a parking area in a forest, but actually that didn't bother us at all.<br/><br/>The valley and the river along the road are incredibly beautiful, the water is icy cold and crystal clear, and as a bonus, I got to see one of the more impressive waterfalls.<br/><br/>The first image shows it from down by the road. The image was taken at an equivalent focal length of 24mm, which is quite wide-angle, and all the water in this fuming creek originates in the fall alone.<br/><br/> The Image of the Day was taken from the side, behind the fall, and it was pretty impossible to keep the polarizer dry for only just a second.<br/><br/>I suppose the fall is about 20 meters high. The enormous amount of water hits a deep pool where it constantly vaporizes and drenches the photographer more than 10 meters away. The pool then overflows and runs down the hill in form of the creek that we've seen in the first image. It's utterly impressive to stand there within the roaring thunder. Wet, but impressive ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/james_lyrics_10859/hey_ma_lyrics_77727/waterfall_lyrics_771647.html" target="_blank">Waterfall</a>" from James' 2008 album "Hey Ma".
