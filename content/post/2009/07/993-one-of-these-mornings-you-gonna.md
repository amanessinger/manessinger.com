When I got out in the afternoon, it was not much more than driving to the lake for some swimming, and to a restaurant because I was hungry.<br/><br/> Anyway. I still had a bracketed image of the sunrise, thus I was not too worried. The view is, as so often, from my study, and processing-wise this image was rather complicated. I used two differently mapped images from Photomatix, lots of adjustments in Photoshop, some Snap Art and a little blur to top. Oh well, I like it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is still Gershwin. I didn't want to use the title "Summertime", maybe we get a little more high summer this year, but the lines are of course from "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/george_gershwin/summertime.html" target="_blank">Summertime</a>". The version, that we hear today, is not even sung, and it's one of the more unusual recordings of this song. It's from the 1968 Ten Years After live album "Undead". There is even a video, albeit of very bad quality, on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLCZXyUsX1o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, but in fact it's so bad, I'd really urge you to go to <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/248764" target="_blank">Deezer</a> for the album.
