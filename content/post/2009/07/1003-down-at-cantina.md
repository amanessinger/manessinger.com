I had a little bit of fever and my digestive system was ... out of order.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090712_185619_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090712_185619_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I can't know for sure, but I blame it to the steak tartare that I had for a starter Saturday evening. It was a pretty respectable restaurant, but it's summer, and ... well, as I said, I can't say for sure, thus I won't drop any names, but on the other hand, I won't give them a second chance either ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090712_190843_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090712_190843_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Most of Sunday I spent copying image data from the old 1 TB hard disk to the new 2 TB one. The computer here in Carinthia must still run Windows XP, because we need a certain accounting program to run on it.<br/><br/>That "operating system" seemingly has some severe problems copying from a big drive that's more than 99% full. It's true: the problem was reading. After copying some 50 GB of data, it suddenly became extremely slow, to the point where it would have taken days to finish the copy job, and the only way to make it fast again, was to reboot the computer. Copy, stop, reboot, repeat. Have a nice day!<br/><br/> Yeah, that's how I spent my Sunday, and when it was finally done, I went out to make some images. That's where I recognized that I must have fever. I returned after only half an hour, but at least I discovered a Mexican restaurant, that I had not known about, and that's only minutes away from home. That's what became Image of the Day.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the "Cantina Theme" from Bob Dylan's soundtrack to the 1973 Sam Peckinpah classic "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFkM7JHWJs0" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has it for you.
