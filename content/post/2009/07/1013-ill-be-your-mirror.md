The bad thing is, that I have no time to write a longish post now ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/velvet_underground/ill_be_your_mirror.html" target="_blank">I'll Be Your Mirror</a>", originally from the Velvet Underground's banana album. I have it on disc 1 of the remastered "Gold" collection of 2005. Nice song, hard to find. <br/><br/>Deezer can't play anything from the Velvets, on YouTube the song is "not available in your country" (many thanks to the music industry, yes, of course I'd rip it from YouTube), but in the dark forests of <a href="http://www.220.ro/hdcUJBVy6U/The-Velvet-Underground-And-Nico-I-Ll-Be-Your-Mirror" target="_blank">Romania</a> I have finally found it ðŸ™‚
