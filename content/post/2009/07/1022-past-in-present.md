I think it's very dynamic. <br/><br/>To tell the truth, this is very much a random image. I took it in the morning while crossing the street, with the camera dangling from my hand. Thus: no compositional effort, no nothing. On the other hand, it was no accident either. I do this from time to time, to make images while walking. It is not concealment what I want, no, it is that kind of random element that sometimes bears interesting results.<br/><br/> The Image of the Day was taken near the train station. The whole area is a construction site now and will be so for the next years, while a completely new central train station is built.<br/><br/>Straight from reality the image did not work, because the red arrow pointed out of the image. Thus I flipped the image horizontally, and then the posters again. Much better now ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/feist/past_in_present.html" target="_blank">Past In Present</a>" from Feist's 2007 album "The Reminder".
