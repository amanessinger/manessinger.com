Sorry, I was busy upgrading a hard disk. Gosh, formatting a 2 TB disk takes forever, and copying 1.1 TB of data ... longer. <br/><br/>Anyway. It's done, my computer in Vienna has almost 4 TB of storage now, I guess as long as I don't begin producing HD video, I'm safe for almost two years ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090707_083824_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090707_083824_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> These are images of yesterday morning. Nothing special, just two images that I would have happily taken anytime, but lately, how should I say, lately I've become rather choosy. <br/><br/> I don't know if there is a connection with <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoBo</a> and the more project oriented work that I did for my book, in any case I cringe when I combine two images like those of today. Well, I still do it, I don't have anything else, but at least I recognize and I apologize: Sorry for that ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_zappa/flower_punk.html" target="_blank">Flower Punk</a>" from the 1968 Frank Zappa album "We're Only in It for the Money".
