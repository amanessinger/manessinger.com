It seems to be a shrine to the memory of some young man. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090721_081706_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090721_081706_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> You find it on the streets of Vienna, near the heart of the 7<sup>th</sup> district, in a corner right to some esoterics shop. Really, I have no idea, but I like it.<br/><br/> If you look carefully, you'll see <a href="/2008/04/543-jokerman.html" target="_blank">Jokerman</a> in it, so obviously he was not a unique chalk drawing as I had supposed, but a rather a stencil or even a sticker. Oh well, the world is not what it used to be ðŸ™‚<br/> <br/>The other image, well, I don't show it for its artistic qualities. It's only for the fact that it brazenly displays a very peculiar notion of "genuine". <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "In Memoriam" from the Finnish string quartet Apocalyptica's 2001 album "Cult". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARI4bMhvem0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
