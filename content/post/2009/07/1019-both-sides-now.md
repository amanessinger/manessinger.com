This is an image straight from the camera, I couldn't have added anything in post-processing.<br/><br/> The other image, the Image of the Day, is one more from that series of compositions consisting of two halves. I find myself trying that very often now. I can't really tell what fascinates me and makes me do it, but fascination it certainly is. There'll be more of that.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joni_mitchell/both_sides_now.html" target="_blank">Both Sides Now</a>", originally from the 1969 Joni Mitchell album "Clouds", but I have it on the 2000 release "Both Sides Now", an album that I actually bought for the songs "Stormy Weather" and "I Wish I Were In Love Again". See her 2000 live performance on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKQSlH-LLTQ&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
