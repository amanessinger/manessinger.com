It's early in the morning, I need to go to work, and I have to get the evening clear of any backlog. I'd really like to post #1000 on time ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> This is one of a series of people images taken with the Nikon 85/1.8. You know that I'm not overly fond of this lens, but at times I like to use it. Actually, for street photography it's quite nice.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/housemartins/were_not_going_back.html" target="_blank">We're Not Going Back</a>" from the 1987 Housemartins album "The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death". Yes, that's the first band of Paul Heaton, the guy who then went on with The Beautiful South. Deezer has the song on a <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/100148" target="_blank">live album</a>.
