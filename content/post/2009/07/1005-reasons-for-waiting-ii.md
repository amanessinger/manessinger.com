Actually that's where those Mock Strawberries grow. After swimming I took a series of those leaves and berries images and thought that would be it, but on my way back, I drove behind a tractor.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090714_170723_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090714_170723_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> At first it only annoyed me, because I could not overtake, but then I noticed the dog. Uhhh ... I had the camera on the passenger seat and, yes, I shouldn't have used it while driving. On the other hand, how could I have resisted?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090714_170725_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090714_170725_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> But it's not only that one shouldn't do that, it's also that the dirty windshield took away contrast, thus I overtook as soon as possible, and after some hundred meters I parked the car and waited for the tractor. I was lucky, it had not taken a side road, and so I got some more images.<br/><br/> Really, is that cool and is that dog cute? Obviously the driver did not mind being photographed, and neither did the dog.<br/><br/>For a short time I considered playing the game once more: overtaking, waiting, making more images, because that way I probably would have got an image with a less cluttered background, but I was already in a hurry and decided to go with what I'd got.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once more "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/reasons_for_waiting.html" target="_blank">Reasons For Waiting</a>" from the 1969 Jethro Tull album "Stand Up".
