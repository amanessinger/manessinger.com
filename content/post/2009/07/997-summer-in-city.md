On my first day back, we had two extended periods of rain, the first between 2pm and 3pm with massive downpours. After that it calmed down, only to begin again when I walked home ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> I made some images in the morning, but what really made my day, was this image of people waiting in the rain, with an advertising of our mayor, Michael HÃ¤upl, in a kind of stay-in-minds-between-elections poster, stating "Always a hit: summer in the city" ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The old Lovin' Spoonful hit "<a href="http://artists.letssingit.com/stranglers-lyrics-summer-in-the-city-67g6th6" target="_blank">Summer In The City</a>" is also the Song of the Day. I have it as a cover version on the much underrated 1997 Stranglers album "Written in Red". Deezer does not have the album, Amazon has no samples, I didn't find a video, thus I can only offer you the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWXcjYNZais" target="_blank">Lovin' Spoonful</a> version.
