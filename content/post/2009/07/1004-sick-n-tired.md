We would have had tickets for another concert in Graz, but due to my condition, we skipped that.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090713_195618_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090713_195618_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The image with the tractor was taken from out of the window of my study, in the morning, when I saw that the wonderful flowers were brutally murdered.<br/><br/>The second image is from the same window, late in the afternoon. I liked what the shadows and the clouds did.<br/><br/> Actually I really love these images from my study. It's always the same landscape, but light, clouds and perspective change enough to make it interesting over and again. Who knows, I may end up with a book of those ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was taken later. The sun had gone down, I tried to sleep a little on a camping bed on the balcony, and suddenly I felt the urge to get the camera and try to make some images from my perspective. Over the years I've learned to always follow such impulses, and so I did. Thus: never go to sleep without your camera ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/ms_dynamite/sick_n_tired.html" target="_blank">Sick 'n' Tired</a>" from the 2002 Ms.&nbsp;Dynamite album "A Little Deeper".
