This is a wayside shrine in a rural livin quarter on the outskirts of Villach. This one is for <a target="_blank" href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/">Bill</a>. I boldly claimed that our trees here in Carinthia still have leaves in their most glorious colors, but it is wearing thin. Nevertheless, I searched and found some for you ðŸ™‚

 Finding a Song of the Day is not so easy. It must match in title or some line in the lyrics, I must own it, I want it to be available on YouTube, and I want to link to the lyrics. The latter is normally the least problem.

The Song of the Day is "'Tis Autumn" from the stellar 1976 album "Fitzgerald &amp; Pass...Again", but although the lyrics are seemingly on every lyrics site on the planet, it's always the text of "Autumn in New York", regardless of where you go. Sometimes I really wonder ðŸ™‚
