The same bicycle on two consecutive days? Oh dear, where will this end?

 On the technical front I have just solved my feed problem. It was pretty easy really. Struggling with Apache’s “mod_rewrite” and complex rewrite rules was totally unnecessary, a simple “Rewrite” for the feed and a “RewriteMatch” did the trick, thus I expect to see the subscriber count go to normal tomorrow.

What had happened was, that the old source feed “http://blog.andreas-manessinger.info/feeds/posts/default” had not been correctly redirected to my Feedburner feed. Thus everybody who had subscribed to my blog before I began using Feedburner, was now hanging in limbo. Oh well.

The Song of the Day (this would be Wednesday, by the way) is “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/norah_jones/feelin_the_same_way.html">Feelin’ The Same Way</a>” from the 2002 Norah Jones album “Come Away with Me”.
