OK, things kinda work on the new site. There are still some images missing, because I had not tagged them properly in my image database, and therefore they were neither converted nor uploaded to the new site. But still, I have switched the DNS entries to point to the new site. More about that (and my first proper post) tomorrow. Thanks for your patience.
