Amazing! Have I really never had a song by Amy Winehouse?? Seemingly, at least that's what my <a href="/index-of-the-songs-of-the-day">index</a> says.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/amy_winehouse/just_friends.html">Just Friends</a>" from the 2006 Amy Winehouse album "Back to Black". See her perform on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzlzI3BnoGw">YouTube</a>.

Any this image? Well, I guess I'll stop using the 150/2.8. It's not the time of the year. It's too gloomy. ISO 3200 at not even 6pm, and that at f2.8, this is not funny. I've just mounted the Nikon 24/2.8, let's see what comes of that today.
