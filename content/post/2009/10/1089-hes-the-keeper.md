It's Friday, I'm on the train to Carinthia and this is an image of Tuesday morning.

You know this bicycle. It's an old friend and I have shown him at least once in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/08/1034-that-look-you-give-that-guy.html">1034 â€“ That Look You Give That Guy</a>". This week was rather bicycle-centric again. I suppose that I can show you some images of other things as well, but at least what sprang to my eye were mostly bicycles.

As to my site, I suppose I still have some problems. My Feedburner stats show that about a third of the subscribers are missing. This is obviously due to the fact that I have not managed to redirect the old source feed to the new Feedburner feed yet. Does this make no sense to you at all? Never mind, just bear with me while things are still flaky.

The layout is preliminary, I haven't had time to work on it yet. So far I have not found anything that I like better, but I have looked for black layouts only. This is due to the black background of the Amazon ads. It would be no big deal to change them to white with black text, I'd only need another export/change/import cycle, and with the current blog this would be a matter of a few minutes only. 

 A white background with black text would make the text better readable, but probably this is worse for the images. As this is a photoblog, I have used black backgrounds ever since, though the sheer number of nice white layouts for WordPress tempts me. Now tell me, what do you like better: the black background that I currently have, or a white background?

On another front I have canceled my SmugMug account today. Feels strange after three years. Just a little bit like leaving an old friend. On the other hand, as far as I can tell from a view in their forums, quite some people are fed up and consider leaving as well.
