Sometimes I have no problem finding a suitable image, sometimes I have to make one. Yesterday was of the latter category.

 I tried to process an image that had quite interesting lines, but then nothing more. Light was garbage, tonal distribution was garbage, colors as well, and after I had finished a B&amp;W version this morning, I decided to try another one. 

Well, I just did, and although the image had some merits, it just wouldn't work. Finally I remembered my friend <a target="_blank" href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/">Bill Birtch</a> and his motion blur experiments, and - what can I say - I found the result strangely satisfying.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pino_daniele/keep_on_movin.html">Keep On Movin'</a>", originally from Pino Daniele's 1984 album "Musicante". This album is regrettably unavailable via Amazon, thus I link to the 2CD collection "I Grandi Successi", probably a good idea because for many it would be their first Pino Daniele album anyway. Hear the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_DL4L25Fw0">YouTube</a>.
