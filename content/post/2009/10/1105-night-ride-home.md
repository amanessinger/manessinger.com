This morning I made some images that could probably have been usable, but then, in the afternoon, on my way back home, in the middle of a slight drizzle, I got pleasantly surprised by an enormous sunset.

It didn't last longer than maybe 5 minutes, and all the while I made image after image, constantly hampered by the traffic. Finally I decided on this one, embracing the traffic instead of trying to avoid it.

 Btw, you may have found my blog to be unreachable today and part of yesterday, and that's because it was every once in a while. JustHost, my hosting company, had some trouble with my machine. It must have affected quite a lot of people, at least that's what my stats say. I'm sorry for that, I hope it's a singular event. If not, well, I'm really not inclined to pay more for something that I've bought anyway and that should simply work. But let's see how it goes on.

It's far from being the fourth of July, but the Song of the Day still is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joni_mitchell/night_ride_home.html">Night Ride Home</a>" from Joni Mitchell's 1991 album of the same name. Great album, great song, hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kone5B87G2U">YouTube</a>.
