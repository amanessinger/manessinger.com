Of course I don't do it, but in many cases it would make so much difference.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091001_170720_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091001_170720_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> It's incredible how much you learn and how this never ends. Of course it's the tools as well. Take this bicycle for instance. I have used <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/detail/" target="_blank">Topaz Detail</a> to give it an extremely graphic and overdone look, basically by combining the presets "Creative Detail Accent" and "Micro Contrast Detail". Then I have made a mask to restrict the effect to the bicycle alone. In the next step I have layered on top what I call my "Neutral Blur" (see "<a href="/2008/04/542-show-is-over-say-good-bye.html" target="_blank">542 - The Show Is Over, Say Good-Bye</a>" for details), and as base of the blurring I have taken the original image.<br/><br/> That's something that I use very often: two opposite effects, both pretty overdone, layered in two groups, one above the other, and then I fine-tune the overall effect by varying group opacities. Whatever the result is, due to the leveling effect of the blur, it needs a "Levels" adjustment layer, and finally I do some sharpening, mostly in the mid-tones and probably again with pulled back opacity. Normally I also apply an edge mask to the sharpness layer, here I simply took the mask that I already had made. Does this make sense? Hmm ... I really should make a tutorial of that. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/to_me_you_are_a_work_of_art.html" target="_blank">To Me You Are A Work Of Art</a>" from Morrissey's 2006 album "Ringleader of the Tormentors".
