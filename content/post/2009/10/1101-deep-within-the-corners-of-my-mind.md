This image is more than a month old. After working on my <a target="_blank" href="/portfolios">portfolios</a> (already seen them? I'd really be interested in your opinions) all through the night, I was not really inclined to go out, and when I finally changed my mind, weather changed its, deciding to spoil the afternoon with a little rain.

Well, it was not only the portfolios that kept me from sleep, basically I have inspected pretty every one of the past 1100 posts, correcting URLs where the conversion process had mangled them, uploading missing pictures, you get it: the tedious kind of work that you delegate if you can.

Six posts still lack images and I didn't have them in Carinthia. These were typically images that I had processed Sundays on the train from Carinthia to Vienna. Five of them fall within two months after I had bought my Windows Vista computer in Vienna. It took me some time to recognize that with Vista, Microsoft had subtly changed the semantics of the Advanced Search dialog. In XP you searched by default for files <strong>changed</strong> after a certain date, <strong>including</strong> that date, in Vista you search by default for files <strong>created</strong> after a certain date, <strong>excluding</strong> that date. Thanks guys, very helpful ðŸ™‚

 In other words, there are still some posts without images, but all those layout-garbling errors that have plagued the blog for two weeks now are gone.

In retrospective, it was a tremendous amount of work, I can't imagine how anybody without solid computer education could possibly do that, but I don't regret it at all. After more than two weeks Blogger still has a hard limit of labels per post. They have raised it from 10 to 20, but obviously their code now requires a limit. And SmugMug? Well, their outages continue. I'm still subscribed to their service blog. Makes me feel good ðŸ™‚
