This is the guy we first had in â€œ<a target="_blank" href="/2009/08/1034-that-look-you-give-that-guy.html">1034 â€“ That Look You Give That Guy</a>â€œ, and then recently in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/10/1089-hes-the-keeper.html">1089 â€“ Heâ€™s The Keeper</a>" and "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/10/1090-feelin-the-same-way.html">1090 â€“ Feelinâ€™ The Same Way</a>".

For no particular reason I have changed to the Sigma 20/1.8, a long-time favorite, and when I used <a target="_blank" href="/2009/01/837-rainy-day-blues.html">this title for the first time</a>, it was with the very same lens. So what? Is this a rain lens?

 This is one of the images that I had envisioned as a square. I had approached the bike, more or less centered the focused headlight, and it was clear to me, that I would do the final composition while cropping. It's not uncommon that I crop, and thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted Byrne</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/">Mark Hobson</a> I have developed a loving relationship with the square, but what IS uncommon, is that I make an image with the intent to crop to a square. Normally these are afterthoughts.

It's rainy now. Meteorologists even expect snow this week, possibly down to 300 meters. Wow, swimming on Saturday, snow by mid-week! Well, let's not assume the worst ðŸ™‚
