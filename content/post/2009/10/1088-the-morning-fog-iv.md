It's Friday morning and this is a picture from Monday. I'm still struggling to catch up. Like I said, I missed the train on Sunday and took Monday off.

 This image was taken from the window of my study in Villach, Carinthia. The rest of the day turned out sunny and beautiful, but in the mornings we see fog now.

Like every year this time of the year, the song of the Day is once more "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/kate-bush-the-morning-fog-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Morning Fog</a>" from Kate Bushâ€™s 1985 album "Hounds of Love". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIosFBWqJ64" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
