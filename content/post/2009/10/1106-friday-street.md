I took this image of a cool young rider in the morning. It was the last possible moment, across the street is the building where I work.

It&#8217;s really getting colder now, the bikers wear gloves and caps, and from next week I&#8217;ll leave work at night. Daylight saving time, here in Austria generally called &#8220;summer time&#8221;, gives way to &#8220;normal&#8221; time this weekend, winter is near.

 At the moment I&#8217;m on the train to Carinthia, I&#8217;ll stay a day longer this weekend, Monday is October 26<sup>th</sup>, a national holiday in Austria. Weather in the south is not too promising, but we will see.

The Song of the Day, &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_weller/friday_street.html">Friday Street</a>&#8220;, is again by Paul Weller. Paul Weller is really an acquired taste. I have not heard The Jam when they were current, I have not heard Style Council, and even the name Paul Weller was unknown to me. At one evening, some years ago, my friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.manfredhauswirth.org/">Manfred</a> played some songs from Weller&#8217;s 1993 solo album &#8220;Wild Wood&#8221;, and this really got me hooked.
