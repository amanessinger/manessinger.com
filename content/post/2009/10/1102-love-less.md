This is a shop in Vienna's 7<sup>th</sup> district. I have not looked what they sell or do. They are called "Less is More", and as I looked at the nice neon sign, I thought that the distribution of lights would make for a nice square. It took me a time to arrive at the final crop, it is still not perfect, but it's what could be done with a crop. Everything more would necessitate going back, and then I'd probably find that there is not more in the subject anyway. Thus I'm leaving it at that.

 Did I sound optimistic yesterday? Well, wouldn't have been necessary ðŸ™‚

Today my categories and tags vanished. Or maybe not. They are still there in the WordPress database. WordPress still sees them, counts them, tells me how many I have, but it is unable to list them. Even worse, category links and tag links find nothing.

Seemingly there are many other people affected, but there is no obvious pattern and for many people it comes and goes. Suddenly tags and categories are gone, suddenly, sometimes days later, they reappear. And maybe vanish again. Isn't it ironic that I left Blogger because of a label problem?
