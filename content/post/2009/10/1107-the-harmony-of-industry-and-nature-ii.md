This is the Infineon microchip plant, the biggest employer in Villach, just 200 meters south of where we live. I'm standing on an artificial hill, maybe all the material dug out when they built the plant.

This image began as an HDR, and somehow it didn't satisfy me at all. I experimented quite a while, and in the end it became this 26 layer job, groups not counted.

 I like these images where I overlay local contrast enhancements with blurs of various kinds. Using masks, I can selectively keep parts of the image more or less free from the effect, allowing me to set accents and emphasize certain parts of the image. Here it is the building diagonally opposite from the sun. You only have to be careful to make it not too obvious.

Just like in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/04/904-harmony-of-industry-and-nature.html">904 â€“ The Harmony Of Industry And Nature</a>", the Song of the Day is from the Nine Inch Nails album "Ghosts", and this time it is "12 Ghosts II". Enjoy it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGJhAheCqv0&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
