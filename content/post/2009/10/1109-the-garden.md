I've not been outside today, I am still not feeling completely well. This is an image from the recent trip to Poland, taken when we made our way over small roads from Kraków to Auschwitz.

I suppose this plane is not in use any more, and why someone would have a jet plane in his garden, I really can't tell. I just found it curious.

Apart from that, there are some new things on this website. If you read this in Google Reader or some other feed reader, you will have to click through to my site to see them.

The first thing are the portfolios. See the menu on top? There have been portfolios for the last four calendar years for a while now, the recent addition is a <a target="_blank" href="/portfolios/bicycles">bicycle portfolio</a>. 

 The other thing is that I am just beginning to offer <a target="_blank" href="/wallpaper">free wallpapers</a> of some of my images. They are released under a <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 United States License</a>, which means that you are invited to use and share them, as long as you don't sell or change them.

Of course you may already have discovered the new NEWS widget on top of the side bar. This is where I will post announcements from now on.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/einsturzende_neubauten/the_garden.html">The Garden</a>" from the 1996 Einstürzende Neubauten album "Ende Neu". Einstürzende Neubauten, this is <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blixa_Bargeld">Blixa Bargeld</a>'s own band, his other major involvement was of course with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. See a video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owJ4fB0XfIk&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
