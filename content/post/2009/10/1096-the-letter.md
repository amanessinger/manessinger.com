Postmen in Austria use such yellow trolleys. You've already seen one of them in "<a target="_blank" hhref="/2008/07/655-on-lonely-avenue.html">655 â€“ On A Lonely Avenue</a>". It's one of the images that I put on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/">Fine Art Photoblog</a>. 

Ahh, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/">Fine Art Photoblog</a>! I probably don't advertise it often enough (in fact I almost never do), but in its almost two years it has developed into a nice reservoir of interesting photography. It's become more quite lately, we all have our own blogs, jobs, lives, but I promise I'll again contribute more often. In fact I did just yesterday. Why not head over and browse a little? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/">You can even buy prints there</a> ðŸ™‚

Uhh ... yes, sorry for that ðŸ™‚ What else? <a target="_blank" href="http://nikonrumors.com/">Nikon Rumors</a> told it for weeks, in only some hours it will be official: the Nikon D3s is coming. What that is? Well, just a D3 with sensor cleaning, video (only 720p) and ISO 12800.

Wait a minute, didn't the D3 already have ISO 25600??? Uhhh ... yes, it did, but it's highest nominal ISO was 6400. 25600 was Hi3, the highest "boost" value. Now with the D3s, ISO 12800 is nominal and the highest "boost" ISO value is ... 102,400!!! Holy smoke 8O

 On the other hand, it's not that much more. It's just four stops better than my D300. On the other hand, four stops, wow! That's pretty much! Imagine the difference between photographing at 1/4s and 1/30s! That's normally the difference between to hold and not to hold. Or take 1/30s and 1/500s: that's the difference between motion blur and freezing the action. Quite impressive.

Of course I won't buy one. Can't afford it. You would have to buy a damn lot of images over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/">Fine Art Photoblog</a> to make that possible ðŸ™‚ 

I'll tell you a secret: I'll have a camera with that sensitivity, and I'll tell you more: you will as well. We only won't have it right now. We'll have to wait maybe two years, maybe three, then we will have it in affordable cameras. It's only that we will not value it, because at that time we will drool about a D4's or D5's ISO 409,600 ðŸ˜„
