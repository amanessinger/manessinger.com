One more post for today, then I give up. It was a long night last night and I am pretty tired.

 This is an image of Sunday afternoon. I took it on a slightly unusual way to the lake. Weather was beautiful, I was swimming, and in the evening I missed my train to Vienna. Well, bad time management. While I prepared dinner, time really slipped away. In the end I had the choice between eating and catching the train. Dinner won, I took Monday off and returned to Vienna the next day.

The Song of the Day is the Jimmy Cliff classic "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jimmy_cliff/many_rivers_to_cross.html">Many Rivers To Cross</a>", today from the 2002 Blind Boys of Alabama album "Higher Ground". This is an interesting song. I love their version, but I equally love all those other versions on YouTube as well. It's really hard to choose a favorite. Here are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGeCeK85sUg&feature=related">Jimmy Cliff</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NK93kcCS9Q">Joe Cocker</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr1S8HWSWf4&feature=related">Lenny Kravitz</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN-jNmzSTok&feature=related">Annie Lennox</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcJCCtZRxCk&feature=related">Cher</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUc7WHHbyeM&feature=related">Eric Burdon and The Animals</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8l4t3_many-rivers-to-cross-bruce-springst_music">Bruce Springsteen</a>, ...

Well, maybe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN-jNmzSTok&feature=related">Annie Lennox</a>. Does not happen that often, that a song moves me to tears.
