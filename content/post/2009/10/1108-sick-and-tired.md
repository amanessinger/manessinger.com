Looking out of the window of my study, and if the sky or the light are interesting at all, taking some morning photos, this has become a habit.

 Today it was an especially excellent idea, because I spent the rest of this wonderful, sunny, warm day in bed. Diarrhea, fever, and generally a feeling of being completely drained of all energy. Hate those days, and even more so, when they are that beautiful!

Tomorrow evening I should be on my way back to Vienna, but I guess I will need another day or two, at least given how I feel at the moment.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/sick_and_tired.html">Sick And Tired</a>" from Eric Clapton's 1998 album "Pilgrim". See a live performance on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaVMgtnns2o">YouTube</a>.
