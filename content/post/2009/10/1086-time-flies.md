Well, here we are: my first real post on the new blog. Was it simple? Hell, no, but in the meantime, after much work, things have settled. Most of the old URLs, those that still bring visitors via Google or some tutorial sites, work on the new site as well.

Layout is pretty neat, but this is not at all my work. It's simply one of the better WordPress layouts. The display mechanism, i.e. the page that opens when you click an image, is crudely crafted, in fact these were my first steps in PHP, some days ago. There is no way to browse the images, at least nothing but browsing the blog. I plan to add some gallery system, but I'll have to evaluate my options first.

 Anyway. This is an image of Saturday. It's the same way leading to the same lake as a week before, and I was even swimming this weekend. I'm not sure yet, but it looks like I would get one more opportunity next weekend ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/vaya_con_dios/time_flies.html">Time Flies</a>" from the 1992 Vaya Con Dios album of the same name. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlndrCYayf0">YouTube</a>.

Oh, and ... if you like what you see ... and especially if you don't ... please just leave me a comment ðŸ™‚
