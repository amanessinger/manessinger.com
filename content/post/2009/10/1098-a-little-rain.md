It's Friday morning. It's stormy outside, just as it was yesterday, just as it was the day before. Meteorologists were right, we had snow yesterday morning. Only mixed into the rain, more the idea of snow than real, physical snow and nothing remained, but I've heard of parts of Austria where it piled up to 20cm. Isn't that strange, given that we had 25 degrees Celsius about a week ago? More strange, given the fact that I was swimming on Saturday?

 Well, that's how it goes. I have no good image for yesterday, but I won't shy away from showing you a bad one ðŸ™‚

I was in a hurry yesterday morning, I took the tramway line #5, and this image was taken through the rear window just before the last station, just before I left. When the train accelerates, water spills down from the roof and runs down the window.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/a_little_rain.html">A little Rain</a>" from Tom Waits' 1992 album "Bone Machine". Wow, is it really that long? Excellent as always. Hear a 1999 live version on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSR2fhsQAXY&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
