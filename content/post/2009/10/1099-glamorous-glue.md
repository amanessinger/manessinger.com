I'm on the train to Carinthia right now and we're just crossing the first ridge of mountains. There's snow outside. Not as yesterday, not a mere idea of snow, nope, this is a white, wet blanket of coldness.

I took this image on my way to the train. It's the cart of someone who posts advertising posters. The interesting thing is only, that there was nobody around.

 I'm back to a lens that I have not used in a long time: the Sigma 30/1.4. Well, probably it's not really necessary to have a 28/1.8, a 30/1.4 and a 35/1.8. Of these three lenses the Sigma 28/1.8 is probably the most versatile. It is not the cheapest, that's the Nikon 35/1.8, but it is sharp (OK, that's true for all of them), can be used on FX, and most important, it focuses almost down to the front lens. Anyway. All three lenses are quite fine and now I use the 30 again. It's the fastest, and that not only means the maximum aperture, no, it has also the fastest autofocus.

Oh, and, by the way, I missed it, but two days ago this blog had its third birthday. Three years. Wow! It was never planned as a 365 days project, I always wanted to make this an institution, but of course you never know. Well, I'm not tired yet. I don't feel what I do as repetitious, it did neither become an obligation nor a job, no chore, no routine. It is still an adventure and I hope you keep following me ðŸ™‚
