No Valentine image today (as Thomas has pointed out, the heart on yesterday's Puch motorcycle could qualify the image), it was just a lazy day.<br/><br/>Do you know these days of wasted opportunities that still don't make you feel bad? It was the first sunny day in weeks, I could have gone up the mountain, and from what I saw from below, it would have been a gorgeous day.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090214_132327_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090214_132327_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I chose not to. At about noon I went for a walk down to the river. This is not a great nature reserve, it is just a place on the fringe of Villach, east of the big Infineon semiconductor plant, that still happens to be rural. I suspect that part of the area is a former waste deposit, or at lest they have piled up a hill of what has been dug out when they built the plant. Anyway, it's an area where local people walk on weekends, and so did I.<br/><br/>It's kind of beautiful there with a small pond, the hill that's high enough, that from its top you see all over Villach, birdhouses that attract a lot of twitter, fields, and then the river. I walked for two hours, made a few images, went back home and ... slept a little.<br/><br/> Later in the afternoon I drove to the local supermarket, and when I got out, I recognized, that I had missed the most spectacular sundown in something like two months. It was still impressive what was left, but in order to take an image, I would have had to change to the 70-300, and that would have cost me just those seconds before it vanished. I chose to look and remember ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Image of the Day is from a little earlier, on my way from one shopping center to the supermarket.<br/><br/>We all know the song from Ike &amp; Tina Turner, and that's not bad either, but "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/deep_purple/river_deep_mountain_high.html" target="_blank">River Deep, Mountain High</a>" has never sounded better than on Deep Purple's second album, the 1968 release "The Book of Taliesyn". Check on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYDm69BXn8o" target="_blank">YouTube</a> how good Deep Purple really were in their early days.<br/><br/>Edit: Well, some research has brought me to admit that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovnVNW0oQjc&feature=related" target="_blank">Annie Lennox live</a> is not to be dismissed either ðŸ™‚
