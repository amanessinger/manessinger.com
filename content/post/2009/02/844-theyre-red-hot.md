The most annoying thing is probably the purple fringing, something that many of the older Nikon primes supposedly exhibit when used wide open. I can't tell, the 50/1.8 and the 50/1.2 don't, but I remember having read it about the 24/2.8 and the 28/2.8. Anybody who knows?<br/><br/>Anyway. With this lens the rule is simple: avoid all extreme point highlights that would burn out, then you should be on safe ground. Raindrops in sunlight are about as deadly as it gets ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Actually I really should not complain at all. This is a portrait lens like its big brother, the 85/1.4, and that means its failures work very well in a portrait situation, where utter contrast and sharpness are probably unwelcome anyway. In fact, it is really not a lack of sharpness, it is a lack of micro contrast, just like a softening veil. There you have it: fine for traditional portraits, not so fine for everything else.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the Robert Johnson classic "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/robert-johnson-they-re-red-hot-lyrics.html" target="_blank">They're Red Hot</a>", today interpreted by the legendary Peter Green on his 2004 album "Hot Foot Powder", the second in the line of his Robert Johnson albums. <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/208704" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the whole album for you to hear.
