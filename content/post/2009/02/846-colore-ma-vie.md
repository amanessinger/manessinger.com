C'est la vie!<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090205_165346_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090205_165346_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> But that's really something to complain about in the next entry, right? These are two of the images that I shot when I left work yesterday afternoon. It was a dull, cloudy day, and if it had not been, the sun would have been down anyway. I lusted for color, and here are the results: a yellow mailbox with some black graffiti and lemons on a tree in front of a flower shop. Heaven knows how they survive ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Image of the Day was originally a vertical with the black line being sharp where it ran into the lower right corner, but I finally decided to crop up to a square, making the image completely abstract.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Colore Ma Vie" by the great Charles Aznavour, the title song of his 2007 album. YouTube has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUs4LsMxOwc&feature=related" target="_blank">the song</a>, and they also have a nice <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYzU8GDsrwQ&feature=channel_page" target="_blank">making-of video</a> about the album.
