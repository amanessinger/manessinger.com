Tuesday morning I tried it with the Sigma 20/1.8, yesterday morning I did it with the Nikon 24/2.8. Not that anybody would care. Rather odd way to introduce a new lens, huh?<br/><br/> There are many ways I could have gone in post-processing, B&amp;W would have been one of them, and even there I would have had a hard time deciding between "Infrared" and "Maximum Black". I finally settled with color, because I wanted it to be more like a strange, undecided dream than like a nightmare.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/innocent_when_you_dream.html" target="_blank">Innocent When You Dream</a>" from Tom Waits' 1987 album "Franks Wild Years". <br/><br/>YouTube has a brilliant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMc0ok9_V7Q&feature=related" target="_blank">live performance</a> with questionable sound quality, and it is outright the best version that I've ever heard. You don't want to miss it, if for nothing else, then for the introduction.
