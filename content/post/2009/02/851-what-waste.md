Yesterday it rained most of the time, and when I finally went home, the rain turned to snow. When I left home an hour later, it was rain again. What a waste!<br/><br/>It's the same thing as the last weekend in Carinthia, where rain had wasted away all the wonderful clean snow that had fallen the days before. Sometimes nature is a poet, sometimes nature is a barbarian.<br/><br/>Or rather: nature is. Neither poetic, neither barbarian, mindless instead, without purpose, not a consciousness, only a coincidence of circumstances. It's we who want someone to blame.<br/><br/> Oh, by the way: the reason why I left home later, was to pick up the Nikon 24/2.8 that I just got from eBay. It's an AF 24/2.8, not an AF-D, thus it sends no distance information to the camera's matrix metering system, but that's OK. It's the second version, the one with the wider focus ring. Like all older Nikon designs it is really small and light, and I like that for a difference. Seems like this was the last image with the Sigma 20/1.8 for some time ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/ian_dury_the_blockheads/what_a_waste.html">What A Waste!</a>" by Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads. The CD that I have is not available any more, but it was a collection anyway. A nicely priced collection available is "Reasons to Be Cheerful: The Very Best of Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads".
