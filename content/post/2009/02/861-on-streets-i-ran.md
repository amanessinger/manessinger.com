Not much to choose from ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Anyway. This is a place where I've tried my luck many times before. In fact, I like this place. It has a wild curve, there are people, so why shouldn't there be thousands of opportunities?<br/><br/>Well, there never were. Normally, on my way to work, when I reach the place, I am already in a hurry. The other problem is, the traffic. It's hard to take an image from this perspective, without getting crossing cars into the frame. This time I was lucky though. Just as I framed the shot, I saw the young man approaching. I made three shots of him and the second was pretty perfect. Not quite the perfection of <a href="http://www.afterimagegallery.com/bressonbehind.htm" target="_blank">HCB's shot</a>, but well, who would complain ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Finding a Song of the Day took me some time, but "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/on_the_streets_i_ran.html" target="_blank">On the Streets I Ran</a>" from Morrissey's 2006 album "Ringleader of the Tormentors" is not such a bad match.
