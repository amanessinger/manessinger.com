Steady drizzles to heavy rains, eating away the new snow that has fallen during the week, but cold enough not to melt the old snow. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090207_161007_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090207_161007_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I was out there just once for the supermarket, made some images there and in front of the house, not overly inspired, and finally gave up. This is the kind of weather where you may be lucky and get a spectacular sky, but there is absolutely no chance in predicting anything.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090207_170212_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090207_170212_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> If it happens, and if by chance you happen to be in the right place, a wonderful image may come together, although the time is very short, because these images were all shot at around what would have been sundown on a brighter day. <br/><br/> I suppose up on the mountain it must have been very beautiful, because there the precipitation certainly came down as snow, but I did not dare driving up the road.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was shot down in the garage. There is a ramp leading up, and I took some shots of of the light coming in through the grated windows. This near-square is what survived.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "The Bunker" from Beirut's spectacular 2006 album "Gulag Orkestar". If youz don't already have it, don't forget to hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXZEN41TtjE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. It's well worth your time. Sorry, no lyrics available.
