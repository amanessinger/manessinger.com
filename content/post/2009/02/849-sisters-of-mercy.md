Today is the first day since November 21 that I have not shot a single image. Wet snow, a constant drizzle, fog below, clouds above, I don't even feel bad about it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I spent a lot of time though, trying to get back into my bookmaking workflow, checking out Shutterfly (as recommended by Mark Hobson), trying to create a template, and so on and on and on. I guess you know how much time runs into those things, especially when you do them only once a year.<br/><br/> Basically this serves three purposes ("among my purposes are such diverse things as"): SoFoBoMo '09 is nearing, by then I want to have the process worked out, and this time I won't stop at the PDF, this time I want to hold a book. #2 is that Mark Hobson recently teased everyone to make a real book, and #3 is of course that Ted constantly buggers me to finally make that god-damn bicycle book ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Speaking of Ted, this is another image from that morning in fall 2007, when we met to shoot the sunrise at Firenze's Duomo.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/sisters_of_mercy.html" target="_blank">Sisters Of Mercy</a>" by Leonard Cohen, is part of the soundtrack of Robert Altman's 1971 movie "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller". I am not sure if it was written for the soundtrack or not, but Cohen's music greatly contributes to the overall atmosphere of this masterpiece.
