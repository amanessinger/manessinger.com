I woke up early and had a little time in the morning, but that was it. Now I sit on the train to Carinthia, and from the few morning images I could use at least this old Puch motorcycle.<br/><br/> Btw, this image and yesterday's have something in common. Both of them were created from two images each. In both cases I had two versions, one a little too tight on the upper edge, the other on the lower edge. In both cases Photoshop's "Align Layers" did a fine job and allowed me to cheat nicely. <br/><br/>Normally I like to frame tight and as exact as possible, but sometimes tight is too tight. Having more than one exposure can make all the difference then.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/im_still_here.html" target="_blank">I'm Still Here</a>" from Tom Waits' 2002 album "Alice".
