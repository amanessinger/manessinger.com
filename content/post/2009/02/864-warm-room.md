Sunday night the train had arrived 45 minutes late, thus I missed the last Underground and had to take a taxi. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090223_082924_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090223_082924_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> When I wrote yesterday's entry, I already knew that Vienna had had a lot of snowfall over the weekend. What I didn't know though, was that it had been followed by relatively warm rain. Thus in the middle of the night I was presented with enormous amounts of slush. <br/><br/>In the morning there was still some rain, though most of the slush was gone, probably more due to busy hands than due to the rain. For part of the afternoon we had heavy rain again, but thankfully it stopped, just as I left work.<br/><br/> The Image of the Day is a window of Palais Auersperg, a baroque palace that is now used for all kinds of events, balls and exhibitions, and part of it houses a safe rental service.<br/><br/>In a way the image is a lie like all images are lies. Would you have guessed that this window looks out onto one of the most busy streets in Vienna? Would you have associated traffic noise? Well, lets pretend it were not there. Let's pretend we stood in a palace garden outside of this window, longing for the warmth of the room behind.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/in_the_warm_room.html" target="_blank">In The Warm Room</a>" from Kate Bush's 1978 album "Lionheart".
