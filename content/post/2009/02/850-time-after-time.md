It took me six or seven frames until it would fit smug into the frame. Took a little, gave a little in Photoshop, that's it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "Time After Time" by Dinah Washington. It's from her classic 1959 album "What a Diff'rence a Day Makes". Amazon has no samples, but Deezer has the whole album for you to hear, though they require you to log in now.<br/><br/>I have pondered if I should drop Deezer as a music source altogether, but I guess as long as they don't require you to pay, I'll go on referring you to them if I don't find anything on YouTube. The sound quality is excellent and you can hear the whole songs. So, it you want to hear it, head over to <a href="http://www.deezer.com/" target="_blank">Deezer</a>, register, log in, and then click <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/126429" target="_blank">this link</a> for the album.
