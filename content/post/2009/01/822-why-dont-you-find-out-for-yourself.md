Maybe the police can now read all my passwords, use my credit card and know my secrets, but I'll be lenient and give it away to them freely ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image was taken Monday evening in a near park on my way from work. It's a homely cage for the kids to play ball games in. You may have seen it at least <a href="/2007/01/90-welcome-at-ministery-of-justice.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="/2008/01/453-urban-playgrounds.html" target="_blank">there</a>. The building in the background is our Ministry of Justice.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/morrissey/why+dont+you+find+out+for+yourself_20096119.html" target="_blank">Why Donâ€™t You Find Out For Yourself</a>" from Morrissey's 1994 album "Vauxhall and I". You see, searching for a title, I had the notion of a labyrinth, a jail, the wish to find my way out, and when looking for a song with "find", this one turned up, it was an all different  meaning, but it's OK as well. Morrissey is right: you can only accept shared experience to a certain degree, everything else you'll have to find out for yourself. That's the game of growing up, that's human nature, that's just the way it goes.<br/><br/>YouTube has many concert videos, I'll mention only two: one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWNGF1SkAAM" target="_blank">earlier</a> from about the time when the album was released, and one, judging by his age, from his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjU5lhkcQJg" target="_blank">recent tour</a>. I like both, but the latter is nearer to my heart.
