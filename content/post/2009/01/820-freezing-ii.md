I got to take some photos though, two from while I was still at home shown here. <br/><br/>I've experimented a little with the effect of viewing the world through frosted glass, and I believe there's a lot more to explore.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090110_105216_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090110_105216_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Both images had elaborate post-processing, this one to get a more surreal effect, while the Image of the Day comes through pretty naturally looking, but of course it had a fair lot of adjustments as well.<br/><br/> Like all the other images since Tuesday, these were shot using Sigma's 20/1.8.<br/><br/>One more time the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.glasspages.org/liquidlyrics.html" target="_blank">Freezing</a>". Lyrics by Suzanne Vega, music by Philip Glass, the beautiful voice by Linda Ronstadt. It's from the 1990 album "Songs from Liquid Days". <br/><br/>We had this song in "<a href="/2008/01/450-freezing.html" target="_blank">450 - Freezing</a>" and we already had the title song in "<a href="/2007/05/209-liquid-days.html">209 - Liquid Days</a>". Hear "Freezing" on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YcFcunLF8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
