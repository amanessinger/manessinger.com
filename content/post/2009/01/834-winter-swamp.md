It began with fog, later we had some raindrops, some snowflakes, no fog but high clouds, freshly fallen but wet snow, actually more water than snow, in short: everything that makes you want to be at home, nothing that lures you out for photographing.<br/><br/> I had some business in Klagenfurt, and later, on the way back to Villach, I took some side roads, hoping for inspiration and the odd photo opportunity.<br/><br/>The first time I left the car to take some images of snow covered logs, I immediately stepped into wet mud covered by a thin layer of wet snow. Somehow the moment was spoiled beyond hope. Some kilometers ahead I saw a swamp that I had never recognized as such in summer, and there I made the last photos for today.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/talking_heads/swamp.html" target="_blank">Swamp</a>" from the 1983 Talking Heads album "Speaking in Tongues" is the Song of the Day.
