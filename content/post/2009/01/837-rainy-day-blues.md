In the meantime I had looked at my bicycle images, had decided that they were probably even less than mediocre, and so I felt the need to pull something out of my non-existent hat. <br/><br/>Of all routes possible, I decided to do the umbrella trick again: Basically you use a wide-angle lens and include your umbrella in the frame. In this particular image I used the verticals of two trees, one fountain, the umbrella handle and a woman passing by, and the result, cropped to a square, quite satisfies me. <br/><br/><a href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Hobsonesque</a>? I think so. It may have something of that certain quality that Mark's compositions always have (and always here means really ... well ... always), that quality that I admire endlessly and that I can't possibly describe. I admit I'm neither ashamed to plagiarize, nor to pay homage ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.6lyrics.com/music/willie_nelson/lyrics/rainy_day_blues.aspx" target="_blank">Rainy Day Blues</a>" from the 2008 album "Two Men With The Blues" by Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis.
