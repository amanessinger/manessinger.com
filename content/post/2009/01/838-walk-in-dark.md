After eleven hours of work I took a different way home, again in the dark and again in such fine weather ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The results were some quarter-decent images with a potential to raise them to maybe three quarters in Photoshop. I tried some of them and this is one that I like pretty well. The pose of the person could be more dynamic, on the other hand the odd silhouette with seemingly only one leg has something disturbing, so I won't complain ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day? "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/a_walk_in_the_dark.html" target="_blank">A Walk In The Dark</a>" is once more from David Byrne's 1992 album "Uh-Oh".
