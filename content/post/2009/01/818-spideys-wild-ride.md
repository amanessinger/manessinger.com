<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090108_164815_03_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2009/20090108_164815_03_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This afternoon I stood for a while in the cold at the crossing between AuerspergstraÃŸe and LerchenfelderstraÃŸe, pre-focused and then put the lens to manual focus, clicking away when bicycles passed, using a slow shutter speed of 1/15s at f4 to get a nice blur.<br/><br/> It's interesting how these bicycle riders come out. Most of them looked just as you would expect a bicycle rider to look, bent over, speeding, just as to get off that thing and into the warmth fast, but this one was ... different. It's a funny, erect pose, almost leaning a little backward.<br/><br/>This is a composite of two exposures, one used to eliminate a few cars in the other.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/spideys_wild_ride.html" target="_blank">Spidey's Wild Ride</a>", is one more time from Tom Waits' 2006 masterpiece "Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers &amp; Bastards". Sorry, no video, you'll have to hear the sound sample at Amazon's. It's track 16 on disc 3, and yes, it goes on like this. I think Tom Waits' maniac singing gives this image a whole new dimension, in fact I was not even sure if this is the Image of the Day until I heard him sing ðŸ™‚
