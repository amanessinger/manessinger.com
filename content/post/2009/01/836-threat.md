Not that I care, but I wonder ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> For an image that consists of practically nothing but bokeh, this needed a surprising amount of post-processing. I had to straighten the background, adjust colors in upper third and lower two thirds differently, slightly rotate the image, crop it to a square, but I think the result is quite OK.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Iggy_Pop:Neighborhood_Threat" target="_blank">Neighborhood Threat</a>" from Iggy Pop's 1977 album "Lust For Life". Iggy was in close cooperation with David Bowie then, Bowie has written the song and recorded it later as well, but to me there is no doubt that the original is miles ahead. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DkTIgL5BMM&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
