Yes, weather was fine, but I still preferred to process yesterday's many images.<br/><br/> Apart from that I had to recover from the night before. Thus I spent this wonderful day partly in front of the computer, partly sleeping in bed - and I don't feel bad about it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I had already made up my mind to use an archive image for this post, but then I thought, hell, that's no way to begin a year. I mounted the Sigma 50/1.4, went out onto the balcony, shot an image of footprints in the snow, figured this would make a nice metaphor for the begin of a year, and back I went to bed ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is called "Footprints" in my European edition, "Long Time Ago" in the US version of Dee Dee Bridgewater's Malian journey "Red Earth", but it's really the same song. Sorry, I have neither lyrics nor a video, but at least Amazon has a sound sample.
