This is the second entry for today, these are today's images.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090120_084850_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090120_084850_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The first image, debris at a construction site, caught my attention for one thing only: an S-curve. S-curves are hard to come by, thus I take them whenever I can ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The other one is one more bicycle. Its headlight again has this typical form that's so common with older bikes in Austria. It's beautiful and I can rarely resist. All the other circles come as an added bonus, and there is even some optimistic light in the right upper corner. What more can I want?<br/><br/> The Song of the Day, Howlin' Wolf's "Look-A-Here, Baby", is on disc 63 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive". It's a bit pointless to recommend this collection these days. I got the whole 168 CD box for â‚¬99, and in Germany and Austria you can still get it for that price, whereas in the US you currently pay $270 used and $340 new. Quite a difference, huh? Still no bad price for 168 CDs though.<br/><br/> Fortunately you can get the song on "Memphis Days: Definitive Edition, Vol. 1" as well. <br/><br/>Amazon has no sound sample, but I found a new music service called "<a href="http://www.thefilter.com/Music/Howlin-Wolf/Come-Back-Home/6749857-Look-A-Here-Baby?TabView=ArtistInfo" target="_blank">The Filter</a>", and they have the song. At the moment it is still available from Austria, but I guess they will close for non-Americans soon, just like most others. Ah, what a pleasure globalization is, at least for the corporations ðŸ™‚
