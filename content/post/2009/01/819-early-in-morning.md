Wow, speak about compressing time ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This morning I woke up at 3:00am, and instead of sleeping on, I decided to post the already processed image of Wednesday, believing that I'd be back in bed in no time. <br/><br/>Boy, was I wrong! Researching the history of the Song of the Day, "<a href="/2009/01/817-just-one-smile.html" target="_blank">Just One Smile</a>", took me more than an hour, and by that time it felt like a good idea to take a shot on yesterday's image as well. When I had finished that, it was ten minutes to six and that's no time to go to sleep, I guess we can agree on that.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090109_070604_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090109_070604_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> As a result I was out photographing at about 6:50am, the earliest I've made it in months. <br/><br/>In a city there shouldn't be much difference between morning and evening light, and in fact I guess there ain't, but everything else is different. In the evenings you never get the streets as deserted during twilight, but that is not the most important difference. What really makes it feel different, at least for me, is the inverse progression of light. Let me explain:<br/><br/> Twilight is great, but it's greatest in a very short span of time, and in the evening you get that during the end. Therefore you've got plenty of time to "get into it". Not so in the morning though. You begin with a pitch black sky, then it lightens up very rapidly, and before you had much chance to adapt, the best part is already over. On the other hand it simply feels good after a morning session. To arrive at work with a feeling of accomplishment is always a good thing.<br/><br/>So how is it for you? Are you a morning or an evening shooter? And if both, what do you prefer and why?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/early_in_the_morning.html" target="_blank">Early In The Morning</a>" from Eric Clapton's 1980 double album "Just One Night". For a sound sample I have to refer you to Amazon, but maybe you prefer this video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruIi-aE0Uv8" target="_blank">YouTube</a> anyway.
