Unexpected Opportunities, that's what happened today. Let me explain:<br/><br/> This morning I should have better been up on the mountain for the sunrise, but instead I slept until 10:00 am. Waking up, I looked out of the window and saw pretty much the same dull, foggy weather as yesterday, but when the fog gave way as predicted, instead of blue sky above, there were only gray clouds. I decided to stay at home and have a quiet day.<br/><br/>I had already resigned to use an archive image, but when dusk fell, I moved out into the corridor, you know, the glass structure in front of our facade that you saw a week ago in "<a href="/2009/01/821-freezing-iii.html" target="_blank">821 - Freezing III</a>", and tried a few shots with the Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8. I had better liked to have ice crystals on the windows again, but a little dirt did as well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>That's what is the beauty of moving to new places: everything is new, everything waits to be explored, even in front of your door.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/annie_lennox_lyrics_3029/songs_of_mass_destruction_lyrics_69581/through_the_glass_darkly_lyrics_674239.html" target="_blank">Through The Glass Darkly</a>" from Annie Lennox' 2007 album "Songs of Mass Destruction".
