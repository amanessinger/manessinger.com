When he left after a late breakfast, it was almost 11:30, and I had to make a decision: Go out or stay home?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090125_103753_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090125_103753_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The day had started quite well, only to go down in quick decline. This image is about the last sun that I saw today, and, honestly, even that is exaggerated ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I did not go out. Of course you never know what happens, once you are above 2000 meters, but at least at 2pm there was no sun at all on the mountains, and the high cloud cover made no signs of breaking up.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090125_153601_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090125_153601_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Instead I wandered around in the apartment, camera in hand, the Sigma 20/1.8 mounted, and made some wide-angle macro shots of the curtains in the living room, of a yellow sewing machine that someone gave to my father 13 years ago and that has finally found its place here in Villach, of book shelves, lamp shades and all sorts of things. When I was satisfied to have at least one usable shot, I went to bed and slept for an hour. That's what I call a lazy afternoon ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/misc/461018958" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/misc/461018958" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> At the moment I am on the train back to Vienna. I have just seen President Obama's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDfpd8GV9dI" target="_blank">Weekly Address</a> on YouTube, and I can't even begin to describe what a wonderful feeling it is, that this long, dark nightmare is finally over. I have always regarded the United States as something special, a refuge of freedom, a place where hope can come true. Well, good luck, Mr. President.<br/><br/>I guess by now everybody has been at <a href="http://obamicon.me/" target="_blank">OBAMICON.ME</a> and tried some images. So have I, and Tonto, our cat, made a fine model ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Hmm ... it's one of these David Byrne times. We had him yesterday with the Talking Heads, we had him last week on his (first?) solo album "Uh-Oh" and today we have him again with Brian Eno on their new album "Everything That Happens Will Happen Today". <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.davidbyrne.com/music/cds/everything_that_happens/lyrics.php" target="_blank">Home</a>" by David Byrne and Brian Eno. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a96jhIWZHAs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
