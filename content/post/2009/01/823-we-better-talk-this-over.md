The first, a graffiti on the wall above a post box, saying "Blood", caused me to go slightly over board photoshoppically. "Wiener Blut"! Well, it's a bit cheesy ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> I really like the second one. I stood there in the park, trying to use the trees for some good verticals, and when I saw the couple coming along, talking lively, I pre-focused and waited for them, just to get into the right position. This is 1/15s at f8 and ISO 2500, thus I knew they would be blurred, and it came out with just the right amount of motion. The guy's posture is perfectly theatrical as well. Of course you can't predict that. You can only click when they are where you want them, and whatever they do at that time is what you get. Consider me lucky ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/webettertalkthisover.html" target="_blank">We Better Talk This Over</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1979 album "Street Legal". YouTube has a 2000 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIizfzMAac" target="_blank">live version</a> of this song. It's audio only, but WOW!
