Forget it! I've slept all through the night. Now it's 6:50, I've just processed Tuesday's few images, this one is what stuck.<br/><br/> Most of Tuesday was processing the Monday images, those of the <a href="/2009/01/815-southbound-again.html" target="_blank">trip to Krk</a>. I did not even bother to go out. My reckoning was, that I would just take a few images at the train station, maybe on the train, or after my arrival in Vienna. After all, when you've been away from a city for two week, then come back and don't find anything interesting to photograph, you're probably not much of a photographer at all.<br/><br/>Well, I just made it, sort of ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This is the elevator up from the underground, arriving at street level, the doors just opening. At night, when I'm out with the Sigma 10-20, I like to keep ISO low by using very slow shutter speeds. This is ISO 720 at f4 and 1/8s, handheld.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Starting All Over Again" from the 2006 collaboration of Randy Crawford and Joe Sample called "No Regrets". This is one of the CDs that arrived from Amazon on last week and that I've collected from the post office early Monday morning. I've found a <a href="http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?key=526165&amp;cat=s">sound sample</a>, but the link is to a Belgian hitparade site, thus you'll probably better hear it now, it may become unavailable any time. Sorry, no lyrics, no video.
