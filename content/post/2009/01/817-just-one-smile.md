Just as yesterday I have I've only a sound sample (albeit a good one) on this <a href="http://www.ultratop.be/nl/showitem.asp?key=526162&cat=s" target="_blank">Belgian site</a>.<br/><br/>The song itself is interesting as it's actually a Randy Newman composition, recorded by The Tokens (I've just ordered one of their few available original albums) and by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le7oHawjumw" target="_blank">Gene Pitney</a>, both in 1966, then in 1967 by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0dWAmxX_gg" target="_blank">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears</a> for their debut album, now by Randy Crawford and Joe Sample, but seemingly never by Randy Newman himself.
