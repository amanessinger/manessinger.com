You see, the week begins and I'm already a day behind.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090119_163003_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090119_163003_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Bicycles always come easy, and especially a poser like this, dropping a curtsy. Does it look cute?<br/><br/> The mannequin in the Image of the Day was standing on the sidewalk in front of a second hand shop. I took several shots and finally kept the one with the people in the background.<br/><br/>I actually put quite some work into the image this morning, because the light was mixed and no straight conversion would give satisfying colors throughout the image. I ended up with a composite of two versions from the same RAW, plus several of Photoshop's photo filters.<br/><br/>When The Kinks sing of a "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kinks/dedicated_follower_of_fashion.html" target="_blank">Dedicated Follower Of Fashion</a>", they sing about a man, but I guess the title fits quite well. I have the song on their current collection, called "Kinks (The Ultimate Collection)". Well, "ultimate" sounds quite final, but don't fear, it will certainly be followed by some "Platinum" or "Mega-Gold" collection eventually.<br/><br/>YouTube has the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQAR-nx4w88&feature=related" target="_blank">album version</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXpkt6revK0" target="_blank">live video</a> from 1973.
