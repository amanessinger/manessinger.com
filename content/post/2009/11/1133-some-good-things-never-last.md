Remember that I wrote about unusual cold, about snow falling, and that this was only weeks ago? Well, now it's different: we have some unusually warm weather ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091119_080927_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091119_080927_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I remember having read that it is subtropic air being spiraled up from the Mediterranean. It won't last though. These things never last. Most trees have lost all their leaves by now. This one was particularly interesting. A single leaf on a whole oak tree. It's probably no good photo, but on the other hand, I really tried to catch a feeling for this time of the year, and in a way that's something that this image seems to achieve, so maybe it's not so bad either ðŸ™‚

 The second image, this little Harlequin, I have found in a small shop. Not the same as that with the car yesterday, in another street, but definitely similar.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/barbra_streisand/some_good_things_never_last.html">Some Good Things Never Last</a>" from Barbra Streisand's 1988 album "Till I Loved You".
