Today I had a whole lot of usable images, daylight images from the morning, night images from my way home from work, I really can't process all of them, I'm tired and it is already midnight. Here are at least two of them.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091117_084702_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091117_084702_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The bicycle is our old friend who featured in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/10/1089-hes-the-keeper.html">1089 â€“ Heâ€™s The Keeper</a>" and "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/08/1034-that-look-you-give-that-guy.html">1034 â€“ That Look You Give That Guy</a>". He inspires me whenever I see him. Well, this may be connected to the particular sign post that he is tied to, because it's near a street corner, a a place where no cars park, and thus the background is always relatively clean. 

 It may also be connected to the brand of bicycles that I've never seen before. It's from the Netherlands, I suppose <a target="_blank" href="http://fotoemma.blogspot.com/">Emma</a> will know it. Or is it the head light? This slightly sad drooping? 

I don't know, but it always appeals to me.

The Image of the Day is, well, all interaction. The guy is obviously courting, the girl does not seem that impressed. Or did I get that all wrong?

 You know how it is, I use song titles as image titles, and frequently the song and the image have no real connection. This is one of those cases though, when song and image match nicely.

The Song of the Day is the Jerome Kern / Dorothy Fields standard "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/a_fine_romance.html">A Fine Romance</a>". I have versions from Sammy Davis Jr, Billie Holiday and Mel TormÃ©, but I can't help it, I really like Ella's version best. It's from the "Jerome Kern Song Book", and I have it in this wonderful box with "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Song Books". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zhcQcge_Ks&feature=related">YouTube</a>.

Oh, by the way, I've enjoyed perfectly smooth focusing for the whole day ðŸ™‚
