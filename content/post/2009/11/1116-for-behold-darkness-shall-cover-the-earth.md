Oh well, here we are. Back to Vienna, let's embrace darkness, for we have no other choice ðŸ™‚

 I'm a little bit in a hurry. It's morning, I have just finished yesterday's image before I'm off to work - and outside snow is falling. It's early this years, this is already the second time, I hope it's just an interlude like two weeks ago.

The Song of the Day is of course "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Messiah#For_behold.2C_darkness_shall_cover">For Behold, Darkness Shall Cover The Earth</a>" from George Frideric Handel's "Messiah", and as (almost) always I recommend Trevor Pinnock. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ79RQThn0g">YouTube</a>.
