Rain and snow, and that the whole day through. Is it a wonder that I can't offer anything real good?

On the other hand, although today's images lack in quality, I somehow like these two pairs of wheeled transport devices. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091103_163516_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091103_163516_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Image #2, the two motorcycles, is curious in one respect: I couldn't stand it at all and was about to throw it away, and then I remembered the two images that I had given critique today on Photo.net, a <a target="_blank"  href="http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=10117166">snail</a> that was simply perfect, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=10109499">street scene</a>, that I really liked, but where I felt something to be missing. The snail had a frame that was absolutely essential to the image's effect, and after I loaded the street scene in Photoshop and added a white frame, I found the image much more satisfying. And really, adding a white frame to the motorcycles made them at least bearable. 

 It's nothing that I do very often, but surprisingly it sometimes works wonders. Just something to keep in mind üôÇ

For lack of a better title (or simply lack of time to search for one), the Song of the Day is once more "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/amy_winehouse/just_friends.html">Just Friends</a>" from the 2006 Amy Winehouse album ‚ÄúBack to Black‚Äù. See her perform on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzlzI3BnoGw">YouTube</a>. It's still as good as it was two weeks ago üôÇ
