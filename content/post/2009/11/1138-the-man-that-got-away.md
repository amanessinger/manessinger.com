I don't know if you like that image. I do. I like the man in the background and how he is in exactly the right position. Would it disturb you to know it, if this were a composite? 

 I sometimes do such things. I take a series of images of, say, a bicycle, and then I find that I can't get a satisfying background. When the right side is perfect, someone is on the left side, when the left side is OK, a car comes in from the right. On a busy street, you can play that game for quite a while and still end up without the image that you are looking for. Sometimes in such a situation I may combine two exposures, say, one where the left side has a perfectly empty background and the right side has a person in the background, just in the right place, just in the right pose.

Do such things disturb you? Would you rather want to not know it? Imagine a situation when you can't possibly find it out: would you want to be told or not?
