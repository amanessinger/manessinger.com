After the rather lengthy third part of the review of my new <a target="_blank" href="/tag/tamron-17-502-8-vc-review">Tamron SP AF 17-50mm 2.8 XR Di II VC LD Asp IF lens</a>, let me finish the day with a much shorter post.

I made this image in the morning on my way to work. It was mostly dry, with only a tiny hint of the slightest drizzle. The image shows a little more noise than I'd like to see, because I had forgotten to reset the -0.7EV that I had dialed in yesterday evening. It's not too bad though, even though I have raised noise in the dark fence by applying a little Topaz Detail to it in Screen mode. I am glad anyway, that I have made the image, because in the afternoon the slight drizzle has changed to solid rain.

 By the way, concerning this lens, I am pretty through with those aspects that interested me most. If there is anything more that you want to know, simply leave me a comment, I'll try to look into your questions.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nana_mouskouri/hold_me_thrill_me_kiss_me.html">Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me</a>" from the 1962 Quincy Jones production "Nana Mouskouri in New York". This is a stellar album and it came as an absolute surprise to me. Hear her on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQY8KUYXfg4">YouTube</a>.
