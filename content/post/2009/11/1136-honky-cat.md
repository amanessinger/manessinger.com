Just like most Sundays, this was a slow day. I left home shortly before 2pm, at a time when you already have to worry about the sun.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091122_155010_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091122_155010_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> My first way was towards the center of Villach, searching for some rectangular, modern architecture, something big and grid-like, something that I could use as a target for calibration images for <a target="_blank" href="http://epaperpress.com/ptlens/">PTLens</a>, but I'm afraid that is not as easy as I had thought.

What I need is a pretty big building, one that fills the frame when photographed at 17mm from at least 20 feet away. I need it to have regular vertical and horizontal features, and they must be narrowly spaced, such that the image contains enough of them, even at 50mm.

 I found nothing. When I gave up, I took this image of the bored cat ("fad" means "boring" in Austrian dialect), drove a little around in the countryside, made some uninspired images, and finally concluded the day with the other image, the temporary container, that is our local McDonalds while they rebuild the restaurant, catching the last rays of sunlight. Why this choice when the McDonalds image is clearly the better image? Well, I just happen to like cats more than burgers, that's the reason ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elton_john/honky_cat.html">Honky Cat</a>" from Elton John's 1972 album "Honky Chateau". See him <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzElZ4z-9I8">live in Ephesus</a> in 2001.
