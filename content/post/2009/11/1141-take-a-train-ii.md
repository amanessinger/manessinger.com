It's Friday, I'm on the train to Carinthia and here is another post, this time a morning image.

 In the morning I take the tramway line #5 when I am in a hurry, when it rains, or when I want to be at work extra early. Today it was the latter, and whenever I am on the train, I try to take some images, either out of the window or in the train. I really like the colors here, and when I look at it, the bokeh of this new Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC is not bad either.

The Song of the Day is <a target="_blank" href="/2009/08/1028-take-a-train.html">once again</a> Duke Ellington's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/take_the_a_train.html">Take the A Train</a>", but this time it is Anita O'Day on her 1963 album "Anita O'Day Sings the Winners".
