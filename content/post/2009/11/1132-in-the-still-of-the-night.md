This morning was dark and gloomy. That's when I made the image of the car. It's in one of my favorite shops, a small pawnshop in JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe. 

Almost every morning I walk by, look into the window and see something that I cold photograph. Most of the time I don't. It's near work, when I am there, it's already late, and normally I have several pictures at that time. This is a shop for desperate moments. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091118_080425_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091118_080425_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Today I took the image anyway. The car reminded me of <a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted</a>'s car miniatures, and somehow I simply had to take it ðŸ™‚

 After this bad start, the day became pretty beautiful. By noon it was sunny, that lasted a whole short afternoon, and when I finally left work shortly after 6pm, it was pitch black night. Oh well, winter can be fine, but not when you have to work during all the light hours.

For the Image of the Day I did not care much about noise. This is ISO 1400 and one could say I have heavily pushed this image. Noise is still pretty acceptable. Actually I really like what I ended up with.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aaron_neville/in_the_still_of_the_night.html">In The Still Of The Night</a>" by the Neville Brothers, to be heard on the 1990 album "Red Hot + Blue: A Tribute to Cole Porter", one real classic of an album.
