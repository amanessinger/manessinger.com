What's better, an old image or a bad image? You'd probably agree that in doubt I should go for the old one, so do I, but not today.

 Yesterday I was dried up, much contrary to Vienna. I had had a 12 hour day at work, and when I walked home, it was dark, cold and very, very wet. I've made a lot of uninspired images on my way home, and some of the better ones came out to be not sharp or otherwise lacking. Basically this one is not much better, but it's morning, too late now, I've got to go to work. You'll have to take what I've got, I'll try better today. Thanks for your patience and continued support. 

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cat_power/silver_stallion.html">Silver Stallion</a>", originally by The Highwaymen, here in the cover version by Cat Power on her 2008 album Jukebox. See her perform live on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN2ZQp3vmFQ">YouTube</a>. Oh dear, not even the title fits! Uhh, forget it ðŸ™‚
