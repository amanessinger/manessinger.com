It is 6pm, and it has been deep night since more than an hour ago. Light is a precious thing these days. For longer than a month it will get worse before it gets better again.

 Usable images were a little sparse today. This one is from my way to the train, just before I entered the Underground. I caught some last, intense light on the top of Vienna's Justitzpalast, the Palace of Justice.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tori_amos/precious_things.html">Precious Things</a>" from Tori Amos' 1992 album "Little Earthquakes". See her perform live on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZusY_UfXdwg">YouTube</a>.
