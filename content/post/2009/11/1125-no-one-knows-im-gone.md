Sometimes the titles won't come. Train, rain, ... I've had too many of them. It is late now, very late. This is an image taken early this morning from the rear window of the tramway train, line #5. 

 Yes, there are still some with real windows, windows that you can open. I love those trains and I always open the windows, take images while the train rumbles on. Not many of them find their way into this blog, but they are countless.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/no_one_knows_im_gone.html">No One Knows I'm Gone</a>" from Tom Waits' 2002 album Alice. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-7vMQyr_LI">YouTube</a>.
