This is the post for yesterday, Thursday. It's Friday afternoon by now, I am on the train to Carinthia.

 I had various images to choose from, but as none is essentially better than this and as I am in a hurry to get to today's entry, I'll leave it just at that.

 This is in front of a shop in Vienna's 8<sup>th</sup> district. I saw the name of the shop, the bike jumping in high spirits, and I immediately liked it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nina_simone/feeling_good.html">Feeling Good</a>" by Nina Simone. I have it in the box "Four Women: Nina Simone Philips Recordings", a set of six albums on four CDs, but if you insist, you can get the album "I Put a Spell on You" alone as well.

Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8tuTSi6Sck&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
