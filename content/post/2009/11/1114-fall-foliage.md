Days get shorter, the leaves are falling, fog lingers in the mornings and stays almost until noon. Yesterday was the last of October, a spooky event in the American world, a beautiful and peaceful day around here.

 This is another image that I have published as a <a target="_blank" href="/wallpaper">free wallpaper</a>. I don't do that with all my images. Most of them don't lend themselves to being cropped to pre-defined formats. In this case I spent quite some time to make variants that look good in the various popular desktop sizes.  The sizes are those that the vast majority of my visitors use, 1920x1200 being the biggest. Hope you enjoy them.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.songlyrics.com/soapskin/fall-foliage-lyrics/">Fall Foliage</a>" from Soap &amp; Skin's 2009 album "Lovetune for Vacuum". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRtT5ry0B5A">YouTube</a>.
