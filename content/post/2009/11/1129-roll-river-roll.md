It's Sunday night, I am on the train to Vienna. Just like in the last post, these are images taken yesterday, Saturday. Yesterday's images, the "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/11/1128-silver-gold.html">Silver &amp; Gold</a>" and the baptistery in a local church, were taken while I waited for one tire on our car to be changed. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091114_085311_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091114_085311_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> So were the first two images of this post. Much contrary to today, yesterday was a beautiful day. You know this slightly milky light, this November light that does not warm you, but that nevertheless warms your soul. That's how it was.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091114_085421_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091114_085421_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I had to wait for an hour, walked around in the neighborhood, entered a local church (that's yesterday's baptistery), took photos of some more industrial aspects, of street corners, a former sawmill and much more, in other words, I had a jolly good time.

Waiting for something, that's normally nothing that I easily bear. I am not a patient man, but being forced to wait on a day like that, holding a camera in my hands, that's pure pleasure.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091114_125505_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091114_125505_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I tried to find out what it is with that autofocus problem that I reported in the last post, but I did not come any further. It sometimes happens, I believe it happens mostly after I have turned the camera on, but -  honestly - I am not even sure of that. It just does not happen often enough and I can't provoke it.

For the afternoon, clouds were predicted to come from the west, thus we decided to make a trip to Carinthia's eastern end, the region around <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=lavam%C3%BCnd&sll=48.209206,16.372778&sspn=0.486876,1.352692&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Lavam%C3%BCnd,+Wolfsberg,+Carinthia,+Austria&z=12">Lavam√ºnd / Dravograd</a>,where river Drau / Drava leaves Carinthia and enters Slovenia. The wayside shrine is somewhere on this way.

Ask me why of all these images, I made an image of some shrubs beside a river my Image of the Day. I can't tell. It's something in this image, some silence, some peace, that mightily appeals to me.

 It is some quality of summer lost, some quality of sweet bitterness, some sting of death, some melancholy, some essence of fall. I can't properly explain it but I feel it when I see this image, when I remember being there, and I hope you can feel it as well.

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/richard_hawley/roll_river_roll.html">Roll River Roll</a>" from Richard Hawley's 2007 album "Lady's Bridge" is probably not a bad match, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ7xDVP3R-I">judge for yourself</a>.
