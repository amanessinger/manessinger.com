Two posts in sequence with the same title? This is a little unusual, I am not sure, but I think we didn't have that before, had we?

But not only this is unusual. While yesterday's little Harlequin had received a proper treatment in Photoshop, yesterday's Image of the Day had been straight from the camera - just like the two images of today ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091120_075120.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091120_075120.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> And wait, there is even more. The Image of the Day was made with fill flash! That's really unusual for me. I own two normal flashes, a Nikon SB800 and some Metz the name of which I currently don't remember, and additionally I have the Nikon macro flash kit, it's just that I don't use them. None of them. This was made with the D300's built-in flash for fill.

 I really admire the big Wizards of Flash like <a target="_blank" href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/">David "The Strobist" Hobby</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/">Joe McNally</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://digitalprotalk.blogspot.com/">David Ziser</a>, to name just a few of them. Flashes really don't fit into the way I work, and as I don't use them, I am really bad at it. Even for something so simple as adding fill light with the camera flash, I usually need three or four exposures to get it right. Well, to be precise, it were three in this case ðŸ™‚

How do you do it? Do you use flashes? Are you good at it? I mean, is it something that you feel comfortable with, that you don't have to try hard to get any results at all? If so, then you are good at it, at least compared to me that is ðŸ™‚

Obviously the Song of the Day is again "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/barbra_streisand/some_good_things_never_last.html">Some Good Things Never Last</a>" from Barbra Streisandâ€™s 1988 album "Till I Loved You". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwewSsKtJbQ">YouTube</a> if you haven't heard it yet.
