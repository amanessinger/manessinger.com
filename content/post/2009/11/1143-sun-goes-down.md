Here is another HDR image from this afternoon. It's again been tone-mapped with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imagingluminary.com/">Essential HDR</a>. I like the snappy look that this program produces.

 I have labeled this post to be part of my <a target="_blank" href="/tag/tamron-17-502-8-vc-review">review of the Tamron SP AF 17-50mm 2.8 XR Di II VC LD Asp IF</a>, the lens that I have bought three weeks ago and that I use exclusively at the moment. I have no interesting sample images, but I thought I should relate another problem of this lens, a problem that I ran into just yesterday and that could influence your buying decision.

Lens flares, ghosts, all sorts of fancy colored things will haunt you when you point this lens towards the sun. It is as if light bounces around and gets reflected back to the sensor by every single element in this lens. In fact, I think that's just what's happening ðŸ™‚

This is no lens to shoot into the sun. Never. It's not bad, it's disastrous. Don't do it.

I will look into this deeper, and I will give you samples. This will most likely not happen before next weekend. I need bright sun and some time for this. On the other hand, whatever my attempts at a more exact method may unearth, it won't change the result substantially.

How does this change my verdict? Hmm ... not really. I have bought this lens for two purposes, as a travel zoom and as a low light lens. I have not yet used it on any trip, especially not in bright sunlight, but from the sunny days so far I can say that it performs very well as long as you don't have the sun in your frame. I guess I can live with that. And the low light part is just perfect. 

  Let me put it this way: Each lens is a compromise. The cheaper the lens, the bigger the compromises. By and large you tend to get what you pay for. If you look at it this way, and if you account for the fantastic low-light capability, the excellent sharpness and the stabilization, then this lens is certainly a fine purchase. It is a good overall performer, it is a low light wonder, the occasional autofocus hiccups are too rare to make much effect, distortions are so-so, and finally flares are a problem. OK, my advice is very simple: just use this lens for what it is best at. Use it, don't abuse it. Avoid shooting into the sun and you're OK. There are other lenses better suited for that. It's a compromise.
