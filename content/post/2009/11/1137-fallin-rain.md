Rain in the morning, a beautiful day from 10am until sundown, night when I left work. Oh dear, I had a hard time finding anything at all.

 I woke up at 4:45am, sat down at my computer desk and began trying to process an image. I didn't have many to begin with, and all of the night images turned out as failures. This one was my safety net, the one I finally fell into. I better like it, because now it's so late that I have to hurry for work. Damn it!

The Song of the Day is "Fallin' Rain" from the 1990 Neville Brothers album "Brother's Keeper". No lyrics available. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EKA9ciNW0M">YouTube</a>.
