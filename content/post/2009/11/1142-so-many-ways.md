These are images of yesterday, Saturday. I took my time writing this post, because the weather forecast for today was pretty bad, and that made me suspicious I could need one of those images for today. Thankfully I didn't, thus you get two takes on the old classic of the way leading into the center of the image.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091128_151957_essential_hdr_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091128_151957_essential_hdr_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image with the bridge is an HDR image made with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imagingluminary.com/">Essential HDR</a>, one of my two HDR programs, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hdrsoft.com/">Photomatix Pro</a> being the other one. With <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hdrdarkroom.com/">HDR Darkroom</a> there is now a third contender, again boasting superior tone-mapping algorithms. I can't comment on HDR Darkroom so far, I've just bought it minutes ago ðŸ™‚

 Why does he need three HDR programs, you ask? Well, they are quite cheap, at least Photomatix Pro and Essential HDR have distinct strengths and one time I like the output of the one, and for the next image I prefer the other. It's about choices.

Anyway. I have a license now, I can already say that the current version has a bug, it always wants to run as administrator on Vista (and according to the forums on Windows 7 as well). Other than that I have just tried tone-mapping a single RAW file and the output was - garish ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/james/so_many_ways.html">So Many Ways</a>" from the 1986 James debut album "Stutter". See the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkVpHG1LJEE">YouTube</a>.
