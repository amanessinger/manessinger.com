All of Austria? No, today there was a spot in Austria's utter east, Burgenland, where the sun still shone, and that's where we sought shelter from the storm. It's a bit crazy and completely irresponsible from an ecological point of view, but it sure felt good to sit in the car and drive 2.5 hours for a little sunshine.<br/><br/> We went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Güssing" target="_blank">Güssing</a> in the south of Burgenland. It's a small town best known for its mineral water, featuring a castle atop of a hill and a Franciscan monastery. This image has been taken in the Franciscan church.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/shelter_from_the_storm.html" target="_blank">Shelter From The Storm</a>", originally from the 1974 Bob Dylan classic "Blood on the Tracks", unequivocally acclaimed as one of his best albums, and a live version is also available on the 1976 release "Hard Rain". <br/><br/>YouTube has the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HJdnOnWK_A&feature=related" target="_blank">album version</a> and a 1976 live video. Well, I'm a fan, I love both, but when you press me hard, I'll take the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRwKudE2Qdw" target="_blank">live version</a>.
