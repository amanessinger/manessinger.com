Yesterday I felt slightly restricted by the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro. There were several moments when I missed images because I was always far too near and going so far back was not an option. <br/><br/> The problem with going back, even when there is space, is that the longer your lens, the more obstacles fit between you and your subject. In any case, I wanted something shorter for today. The morning was rather gloomy (it did get better though during the day), thus 1/200s, as I use with the Sigma 150mm lens, did not feel promising anyway. I really hate getting into high ISOs at daylight and even at f2.8.<br/><br/>Following that impulse, I decided to use the Sigma 50/1.4, one lens that I have not used in a long time. With it I took this image of a small copy of a greek sculpture. I found it in the window of a greek restaurant.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/Ella_Fitzgerald:Big_Boy_Blues" target="_blank">Big Boy Blue</a>" by Ella Fitzgerald. I have it on a 10 CD collection that I've got for 10â‚¬, but as that is not available elsewhere, I link to "The Platinum Collection".
