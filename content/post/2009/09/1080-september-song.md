<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090927_164723_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2009/20090927_164723_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Funny that I have never used "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lou_reed/september_song.html" target="_blank">September Song</a>" as a title. It was an obvious title for this image, in fact so obvious, that I thought it must have been taken two years ago. <br/><br/> Of all versions that I know of this song, none is better than what Lou Reed recorded for the 1985 all-star collection "Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill". I know, this record is not available any more, but if you happen to find a copy: get it. It's so good. Hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIeVuqCLWxA&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>As for the image, I took it when I went swimming this afternoon. Maybe for the last time this year. Who knows?
