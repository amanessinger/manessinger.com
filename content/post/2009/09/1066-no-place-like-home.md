Uhhh ... damn those associations ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> This is an image of Sunday. I took it in the early evening, just minutes before we arrived in Villach after 9.5 hours of driving. Most of the way from KrakÃ³w to the Slovak border it just did not rain, most of the way through Slovakia we had sunshine, but then in Austria we came into some of the worst rains that I've ever had to endure on a highway. Still, everything went well.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/0-9/4_non_blondes/no_place_like_home.html" target="_blank">No Place Like Home</a>" from the 1992 4 Non Blondes album "Bigger, Better, Faster, More!". They had one or two hits then, made this album and were never heard of. It's not their best song, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtnXxhfDI5g" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has it, but I suggest you hear into the biggest hit "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcQGsoDkDk&NR=1" target="_blank">What's Up?</a>" as well. Much better for my retarded taste ðŸ™‚
