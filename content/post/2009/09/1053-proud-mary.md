Yesterday was particularly good.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090831_170045_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090831_170045_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I post no more than three images, because I am one day behind, but I have tagged three more as TODO, meaning they will very likely turn up on some meager day.<br/><br/>Today I have two half/half compositions for you. One, the torn advertising on a lamp mast, is obviously a straight photography, the other, the Image of the Day, is as well, although in that case you simply have to believe me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090831_165529_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090831_165529_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> There was a lot of glass involved, I was standing in the entrance of a shop, the woman is an advertising poster behind glass, the dark edge in the center is where two sheets of glass meet. I can't remember the exact configuration. In any case, this is the same shop that brought us "<a href="/2007/10/362-fashion-victim.html" target="_blank">362 - Fashion Victim</a>".<br/><br/> Along with the third image, the furniture on a balcony, these could all be from my SoFoBoMo book "Urban Dreams II". Obviously I am not yet done with that series ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tina_turner/proud_mary.html" target="_blank">Proud Mary</a>" by Tina Turner. <a href="/2009/03/869-river-deep-mountain-high-ii.html" target="_blank">In March</a>, when I used "River Deep Mountain High" as a Song of the Day, I bought Tina Turner's 3 CD "Platinum Collection". That's what I've linked to. See a fantastic live performance on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCCS5fixC70" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
