<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090908_120600_1_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2009/20090908_120600_1_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>These are images of yesterday, our first day spent entirely in the center of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakow" target="_blank">KrakÃ³w</a>. The Image of the Day features the cupola of the small church of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._Wojciech">sw. Wojciech</a> (St. Adalbert), located in one corner of the vast central market square.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090908_141433_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090908_141433_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The chain looks gruesome, but it is no more than a simple chain, hanging in front on the Dominican Church. On the other hand, were the Dominicans not the order assigned with the duty of the Holy Inquisition? Maybe the chain is not so wrong after all.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090908_181159_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090908_181159_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The final image was taken when we sat in the patio of our hotel, drinking a glass of beer and enjoying the last rays of the sun. <br/><br/>For most of the images, and especially for the three shown here, I used the Sigma 28/1.8. A marvelous lens and clearly my current favorite as a "normal" lens.<br/><br/> I have made many, many more images, most of them much more characteristic of this city, but it's the same old story: I tend to go into "documentation mode". <br/><br/>Most images will help me remember the place. In fact, from many of my past journeys I remember almost nothing but the places where I have taken images, although those I remember well. Thus a yield of 3 out of 200 does not particularly worry me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/handel_george_frideric/36_air_for_alto_thou_art_gone_up_on_high.html" target="_blank">Thou Art Gone Up On High</a>" from Handel's "Messiah". As always I recommend the 1990 recording conducted by Trevor Pinnock, though you can't go wrong with John Eliot Gardiner or William Christie either.
