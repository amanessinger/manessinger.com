Honestly, I don't know. It somehow seemed appropriate.<br/><br/> I spent most of this evening trying to create a simple image display application for my new site. It's not more than a single PHP page, it's trivial, but as it's the first time that I write anything in PHP, nothing seems trivial to me. It's not even done yet. So far it looks OK in everything but Internet Explorer. Sigh!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/life_is_a_long_song.html" target="_blank">Life Is A Long Song</a>" from the 1972 Jethro Tull album "Living in the Past". See sort of a chamber music version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE8YLPHZImw&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Gotta love it.
