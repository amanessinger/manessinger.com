On the other hand, it was a wonderful late summer day and I left work early to go swimming, thus I should not complain ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090903_082102_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090903_082102_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Both of these images are from yesterday morning and both were taken with the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro. These are the last images with this lens for at least two weeks. At the moment I am on the train to Carinthia, on Sunday I'll be on a week-long trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KrakÃ³w" target="_blank">KrakÃ³w</a>, Poland, and then I'll spend another week in Carinthia. <br/><br/> I have decided to leave the 150 in Vienna. It is too heavy and as a walk-around lens only useful when you have the chance to return to a place. My lenses for the next two week are the three zooms Tokina 11-16/2.8, Nikon 18-200 VR, Nikon 70-300 VR, and the three primes Sigma 28/1.8, Nikon 50/1.8 and Nikon 10.5/2.8 fisheye. <br/><br/>The 28 will be my "normal" lens, the fish may be useful when ultra-wide is not wide enough, and the 50/1.8 is in my Carinthian bag at all times since I bought the superior but heavier and bigger Sigma 50/1.4. Additionally I will have my tripod in the car and the Lee graduated neutral density filters in the bag. I hope the weather plays nice ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eurythmics/power_to_the_meek.html" target="_blank">Power To The Meek</a>" from the 1999 Eurythmics album "Peace".
