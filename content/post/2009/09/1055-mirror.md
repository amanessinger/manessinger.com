Yes Ted, I know, I've been sucking the color out, but I couldn't help it, it just happened ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090902_181846_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090902_181846_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Basically it began with that compressed view down the street. You know, I had no good images today. Lack of time, lack of inspiration.<br/><br/>Now, instead of giving up and taking one from the TODO batch, I put layer upon layer, tried a little this and a little that, finally ending up with more than 30 layers and a still pretty uninspired image. Oh well.<br/><br/> While the process for the street view was improvised and more or less random, I decided to use a similar style for the Image of the Day. I like the sober mood.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/t/thewho4144/gotothemirror274312.html" target="_blank">Go to the Mirror!</a>" from the 1969 Who album "Tommy". Hear the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPzY30v9mtg" target="_blank">album version</a> on YouTube, and if you like, they have also the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THbvc3lx2pk" target="_blank">movie scene</a> with Ann Margret and Jack Nicholson.
