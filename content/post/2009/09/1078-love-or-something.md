I took the images in front of the same school/kindergarten in Vienna's Josefstädter Straße where I made "<a href="/2008/10/727-gang.html" target="_blank">727 - The Gang</a>"<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090925_080322_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090925_080322_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I like both of these bicycle images. The love theme in the Image of the Day was obvious, but I don't know exactly what to make of the other one. Neglect? A father leaving his child? Or nothing at all like that? Maybe the small bike only fakes being tied to the railing? What if this bike is spying upon the man? Could this bike be a detective? There's certainly something in his pose, that reminds me of a young hero ...<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090925_155335_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090925_155335_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The other two images happened on my way to the train, the "Karma" image just before I went down into the Underground, the other one just after I had re-emerged. "Karma" is basically the same kind of composition as the Image of the Day or so many of the half / half images in my SoFoBoMo '09 book "<a href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/urban_dreams_ii" target="_blank">Urban Dreams II</a>", only not horizontal but vertical.<br/><br/> The second image, the one with the tramway tracks and the giant advertising in the background, somehow appealed to me, wanted to be taken. It's something about the keen lines and the surreal effect of the giant legs. I don't know, I can't really tell why I took the image. I saw it and the urge was there. I'm pleased with the result though.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_geldof_the_boomtown_rats/love_or_something.html" target="_blank">Love Or Something</a>" by Bob Geldof &amp; The Boomtown Rats. I have it on the collection "Loudmouth: The Best Of Bob Geldof &amp; The Boomtown Rats". See a nice video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGXi_c5_euc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
