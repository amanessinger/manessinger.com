Well, in the end I did, quite spiritless, and as I drove around near home, I had the idea to this image: How about taking an image of a mirror, focused on the mirror itself, keeping background and mirror image well out of focus, with the background and the mirror image showing vastly different scenes.<br/><br/> I admit the execution was a little sloppy, I may get back to the concept another time. It also does not need to be a car mirror, it could be a mirror shard held in a hand, just like on Joe McNally's book, a little hand mirror, that's all not so important, but it is necessary to face some industrial landscape, while standing with the back to some rural scene, an opportunity that you typically find at the fringes of our cities.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sophie_zelmani/ill_see_you_in_another_world.html" target="_blank">I'll See You (In Another World)</a>" from Sophie Zelmani's 1996 self-titled debut album.
