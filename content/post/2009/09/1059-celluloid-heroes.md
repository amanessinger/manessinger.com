My Internet connection is great, the only problem is, that I forgot my computer mouse. Editing images with a touchpad is, well, interesting. I'll get one tomorrow ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> We drove all day, everything went well, but we arrived when it was already dark. I was tired from the road and only went out for half an hour to make some images. <br/><br/>These bronze soldiers stand on the small square just in front of our hotel. I have no idea who they were. There is an inscription at the bottom of the monument, but of course it's Polish. I'll ask at the reception tomorrow.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kinks/celluloid_heroes.html" target="_blank">Celluloid Heroes</a>" by The Kinks. I have it on disc two of "The Ultimate Collection". See a live video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=l_RvgC7JiQQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
