That's pretty much what you get for using such a long and heavy lens as the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090901_083539_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090901_083539_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I already use a shutter speed of 1/250s, but at times even that is not enough. And then, of course, there is the fact, that with an unstabilized lens, the image in the viewfinder is incredibly shaky, just like your hands. That's probably the only bonus of in-lens stabilization line Nikon and Canon use, against in-body stabilization, like all the rest uses: you get a steady viewfinder image. Not a bad thing for composing.<br/><br/> Anyway. This is not a stabilized lens, neither is the Nikon 200/2.0 AI that I saw today in a shop. Used, good condition, 1300â‚¬. No, I won't buy it, but I know for sure I'll regret it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nick_cave_and_the_bad_seeds/let_the_bells_ring.html" target="_blank">Let The Bells Ring</a>" from Nick Cave's 2004 double album "Abattoir Blues / Lyre of Orpheus", for sure one of his best works. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp7mmXvCODA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. <br/><br/>If you don't know the album and you have six minutes to spare, there is another video with a compilation of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1ytLFTluvw" target="_blank">four songs</a> from the album, and it even begins with "Breathless", my absolute favorite ðŸ™‚
