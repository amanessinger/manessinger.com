It does not feel good, believe me, I tell you.<br/><br/>Today, like the last few days, I spent most of my time working on my new web site. The plan is to keep the blog on Blogger (I really can't complain in the least about them), but to migrate the images from SmugMug to my own site. <br/><br/> Why? Because I have been patient now for more than half a year, have endured the outages, have heard the excuses. I am fed up with them. I have no idea if I can make it better, i.e. create something that at least for me feels better, without making it feel much worse for you, but I have to try. <a href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/2009/09/15/mindless-entertainment/" target="_blank">Paul Lester</a> would say "It's a guy thing" ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image is from yesterday. Yesterday the weather was much better anyway.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/the_land_of_plenty.html" target="_blank">The Land Of Plenty</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 2001 album "Ten New Songs", co-written by Sharon Robinson.
