Yes, I did some things and it's been more or less random. I followed impulses, and as on another day the impulses would be different, so would be post-processing.<br/><br/>No, it's not the procesing, it's the crop. This is what took time, what made me try and go back, back and forth, many times, but now I am satisfied. I really like the balance in this image, and - interestingly enough - it's a kind of <a href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">hobsonesque</a> balance that I originally set out to achieve with today's image, and that I now enforced in this image of last Monday, our first full day in Poland, the day we went to Auschwitz. Obviously taking photographs and processing photographs are two very similar creative processes for me, cropping being very similar to the original process of composing through the viewfinder.<br/><br/> Why I post a past image instead of what I photographed yesterday? Easy to answer: I only made one image, a personal portrait snapshot. We had rain all day and that very fact sucked the creativity out of me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dire_straits/ride_across_the_river.html" target="_blank">Ride Across The River</a>" from the 1985 (oh my, so long ago!) Dire Straits album "Brothers in Arms". This is the very album that made the then new Compact Disc popular.
