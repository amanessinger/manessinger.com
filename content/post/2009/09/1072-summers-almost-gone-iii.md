"Summertime" is one of them (I <a href="/2009/07/993-one-of-these-mornings-you-gonna.html" target="_blank">kinda missed it</a> this year) and another one is of course "Summer's Almost Gone".<br/><br/> I took this images yesterday on my way to the lake. The water level is unusually high for this season, but it is still warm enough to enjoy ten minutes of swimming. This is late sun falling between the trees of a rural orchard.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/doors/summers_almost_gone.html" target="_blank">Summer's Almost Gone</a>" from the 1968 Doors album "Waiting for the Sun". We had it <a href="/2008/09/699-summers-almost-gone-ii.html" target="_blank">last year</a> and <a href="/2007/09/344-summers-almost-gone.html" target="_blank">the year before</a>. Actually it was interesting for me to compare the pictures, but in a way they all seem to carry the concept over. <br/><br/>Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcEAI5p-wUg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
