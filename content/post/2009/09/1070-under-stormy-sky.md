At the moment I am pondering a major overhaul of this blog, and most of my time goes into reading web reviews of web hosting services, comparing hosting plans, etc.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090917_153748_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090917_153748_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Anyway. Yesterday was supposed to be a mostly rainy day and it actually turned out to be not. There were high clouds towering on all horizons, but most of the day it was warm and sunny in central Carinthia. I was even swimming.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/daniel_lanois/under_a_stormy_sky.html" target="_blank">Under A Stormy Sky</a>" from Daniel Lanois' first album, the 1989 release "Acadie". <br/><br/>To my great surprise YouTube has multiple videos, for instance a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFCjds--pJI&feature=related" target="_blank">live performance</a>, another that's part of a documentary, where Daniel explains <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9_UdYbzLxk&feature=related" target="_blank">what this song is about</a>, and finally another documentary about the Canadian "Mariposa" festival, where he performs the song in a manner very <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqzJBkcD_iU&feature=related" target="_blank">similar to the album version</a>. Pretty nice coverage ðŸ™‚
