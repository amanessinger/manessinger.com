Today an image is what you make of the raw data that the sensor captured.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090912_104416_ps_2.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090912_104416_ps_2.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> These are two images of Saturday, our last day in Poland. We had been visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko?ciuszko_Mound" target="_blank">Ko?ciuszko Mound</a> in the morning (the image of the spiral stairs is from there), later the salt mines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieliczka_Salt_Mine" target="_blank">Wieliczka</a>, and finally, late on that overcast and gloomy afternoon, we drove a little bit around, and that's where I made the other image.<br/><br/>As to the Image of the Day, I could not really decide what I like better, the B&amp;W version, concentrating on tonal density and contrast, or the color version, concentrating more on the Yin-Yang aspect. I like both. You decide.<br/><br/><center><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090912_163544.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090912_163544.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090912_163544_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090912_163544_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></center> <br/><br/>The other image is presented in two versions, to the left straight out of the camera, and to the right what I made of the RAW file. This is not a particularly good image, it's more that I tried what I can do with it and myself was surprised about the result. I post it as a reminder to all those JPEG shooters. You miss something ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/your_own_choice.html" target="_blank">Your Own Choice</a>" from the 1970 Procol Harum album "Home". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUb_Suzwwfg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>By the way, I had a hard time with yesterday's image of the town hall in TarnÃ³w. I finally decided to give it an overhaul and have cropped it from below. The result finally has the balance that I was looking for. <a href="/2009/09/1064-tarnow.html" target="_blank">See for yourself</a>. You may have to reload the page to see the new image.
