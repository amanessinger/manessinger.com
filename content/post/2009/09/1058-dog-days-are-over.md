I took it on my way to the lake. I wanted to go swimming one more time. No idea what the weather in a week will be.<br/><br/>Btw, due to yesterday's 20 hours downpour, the water level in the lake has risen by between 20 and 30cm to an all-year high. Pretty impressive. This has also cooled down the water to maybe 22 centigrades, which is very comfortable.<br/><br/> The rest of the day was shopping, packing for tomorrow's trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" target="_blank">KrakÃ³w</a>, Poland, and dining out with <a href="/2007/12/425-michael-and-happy-fish.html" target="_blank">Michael</a>, who visited us today.<br/><br/>I guess the next blog entry will be from Poland, at least if the hotel has WiFi as promised. If not, if you don't hear from me for a week, then I am not dead, then I have a connection problem ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/florence_and_the_machine/dog_days_are_over.html" target="_blank">Dog Days Are Over</a>" by Florence + the Machine. The album "Lungs", that I have linked to, won't be out in the US before October 20. You can either wait or get the download. YouTube has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0ZPTFfpO40" target="_blank">video</a>.
