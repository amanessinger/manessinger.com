In a journal from 2001 I have read about the region, that legions of its inhabitants had gone to America, especially to Chicago and Toronto, but that most of them never had given up their houses.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090909_115118_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090909_115118_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Indeed you see innumerable of the typical wooden houses being uninhabited. In fact it's pretty easy to see why: Although the region is beautiful, there is not much work available, almost no industry. My impression is though, that in the meantime tourism has become a substantial pillar of the region's economy, with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakopane" target="_blank">Zakopane</a> being the #1 winter sports center in Poland. <br/><br/>Personally I was not particularly impressed though. I am afraid I am spoiled by our own mountains.<br/><br/>Other than that, let me bring forth one gripe that I have with Poland: It's the habit of the Polish to burn things. We have called this trip jokingly an olfactory trip into the past. Let me explain.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090909_172212_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090909_172212_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Sometime in my youth it became forbidden to burn junk and plant remains on the fields or in your garden. Neither I nor my parents had ever done such a thing, but it was pretty common among farmers, and I can vaguely remember the protest against the law. It worked well though, and here in Poland I can experience what it means to the environment to not have such a law: It's crazy, you see fires everywhere, everybody seems to burn some hay, leaves or whatever, and the air is constantly - and pretty unnecessarily - filled with smoke that hangs over the landscape like fog. That's rather unfortunate, because the pollution by the heavy industry seems to be well under control.<br/><br/> By the way, the final image shows the name of a village. Language is another problem here in Poland, if for nobody else, then at least for me. Normally when I read a name in German, English, Italian, Spanish and to a degree French, I know how to pronounce it, and when I see it, I can more or less immediately recognize it. Not so here. Polish spelling is in a certain way elaborate that makes recognition pretty hard for me, and in some cases, like with this village's name, it takes some pondering before I even have an idea of how to pronounce it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billy_joel/close_to_the_borderline.html" target="_blank">Close To The Borderline</a>" from Billy Joel's 1980 album "Glass Houses".
