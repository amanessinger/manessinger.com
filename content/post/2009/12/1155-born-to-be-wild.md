It's still raining. I am on the train to Carinthia and here is an image of this morning.

 It's funny what you look at when you desperately need an image. This speck of concrete in the asphalt of the sidewalk caught my attention. Somehow it looked like a wild animal, most likely a gorilla, angrily crying.

The Song of the Day is "Born To Be Wild", but not the Steppenwolf version from Easy Rider, no, a version from Romanian brass band <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanfare_Ciocarlia">Fanfare Ciocarlia</a>'s 2007 album "Queens and Kings". If you don't know them, you've missed something, and if you possibly can, try to see them live as well. I have and it was incredible. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ueGYO57JSA">YouTube</a>.
