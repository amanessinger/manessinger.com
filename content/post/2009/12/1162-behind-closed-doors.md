Well, it's been incredibly tedious these last few days to come up with anything usable at all - and it shows.

 But then, what can I do? Sometimes it flows, sometimes it trickles, and these days it certainly trickles. It's not even lack of inspiration, it's more a lack of time, and then, the constantly grayish weather is not exactly helpful ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dolly_parton/behind_closed_doors.html">Behind Closed Doors</a>" from Dolly Parton's 1996 album "Treasures". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvqAdi2Dfs">YouTube</a>.
