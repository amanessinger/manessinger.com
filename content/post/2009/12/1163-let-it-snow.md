I deny any responsibility for this image. Eric Jeschke made me do it. Over on his blog he posted an entry called "<a href="http://redskiesatnight.com/2009/12/14/night-swimming/">Night Swimming</a>". Pure sadism and needless showing off, if you ask me ðŸ™‚

Well, I suppose living on Hawaii has its merits. Eric tried to console me with the fact that they miss snow on Hawaii. Eric, it doesn't console me, it makes things worse ðŸ˜„

Here it is, that's what today looked like here in Villach. I had planned driving to Klagenfurt and renting a car, a Mercedes Benz Sprinter, to leave it in Villach over night, and to drive to Salzburg tomorrow, to transport Michael's belongings to Vienna. 

 For the road to Klagenfurt, we avoided the highway. Nothing worse than being stuck on a highway in winter, and according to the radio, there were several accidents on Carinthia's highways this morning. Instead we tried the normal road, but as early as in Villach we had our first near-accident. While driving straight ahead at 35 kmph, the car lost grip on one side, spun around, and I was quite thankful that no other car was near. This sealed it, I canceled the Sprinter, we'll have to move Michael's things another weekend.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/michael_buble/let_it_snow.html">Let It Snow</a>" from the Special Edition of Michael BublÃ©'s 2007 album "Call Me Irresponsible". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.myvideo.at/watch/3102788/Michael_Bubl_Let_It_Snow">MyVideo</a>. It's the same song that we had in "<a target="_blank" href="/2008/12/792-let-it-snow-let-it-snow-let-it-snow.html">792 â€“ Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow</a>", only then it was by Manhattan Transfer.
