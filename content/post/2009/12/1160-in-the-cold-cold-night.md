<a target="_blank" href="/2007/12/425-michael-and-happy-fish.html">Michael</a> is in Vienna now. Yesterday we had a look at his new apartment. On Sunday I will help him move his things from Salzburg to Vienna. It's going to be a short weekend. Sigh!

 It was very cold yesterday. I made this image while I went from work to Michael's prospective apartment. In my imagination I had made lots of good images, but when I saw them at last, most were flawed in one way or the other, but that's OK. It saves me time processing ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/white_stripes/in_the_cold_cold_night.html">In The Cold, Cold, Night</a>" from the 2003 White Stripes album "Elephant". Can it be that Michael gave me the CD? Would be a funny coincidence ðŸ˜„

YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RB2BvvByUo">live performance</a>.
