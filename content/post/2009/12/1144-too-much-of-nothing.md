Well, you know the saying, too much of nothin' can make a man feel ill at ease. This is the only image for yesterday, and I really didn't want to post it. It's really nothing, but then, when I look at it, it's too much of nothing to throw it away.

I waited until today, waited if I'd get so many excellent images, that I'd easily be able to spare one instead of yesterday's, and though I got some usable candidates, they are not soooooo much better at all. In the end I decided to post this anyway. If you don't like it, well, maybe the next post is for you ðŸ™‚

 Btw, the building in the right upper corner, that's the top of the building where I work. It's pretty ugly, but then, it's right in the heart of Vienna. The thing above the semaphore is a public clock. 1970's aesthetics, if I'm right, and we have a lot of them, so many in fact, that I have stopped carrying wrist-watches.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/too_much_of_nothing.html">Too Much Of Nothing</a>" from "The Basement Tapes". Buy them if you don't have them. It can't get any more classic. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m24JXMj7kMk">YouTube</a>.
