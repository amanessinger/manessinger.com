The world changes, and it does not. So we do, and we do not. Time goes by, another year is over, a new one waits for us, and it will be like all the others: it will bring us joy and tears, and when among the tears there is enough joy to remember, then it is a good year.

 I'd like to thank all my readers, all of you who take time to comment, all of you who are too busy and still come back, all of you who were actually looking for a song and who found that you like the pictures as well. I wish you all the best. See you on the other side ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cousteau/last_good_day_of_the_year.html">Last Good Day Of The Year</a>" from the UK band Cousteau's self titled debut album. Enjoy it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uQJ2uFhurM">YouTube</a>.
