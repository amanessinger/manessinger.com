Vienna. An image taken at 5:08pm. And there is hope: It's less than a week, and then the days will begin to get longer again. Slowly at least ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091214_170755.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091214_170755.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> So far it is just getting colder. I took this image of a mannequin outside a shop in Vienna's 7<sup>th</sup> district. I have completely re-lit the image, and actually I am pretty pleased with the result. Click on the thumbnail and compare the JPEG from the camera with my version.

This was just one possible way to go. It's always like that and this is the nice thing with digital post-production: you have a chance to completely change the image after the capture. I could have achieved a very similar result with flash, but that would have meant off-camera flash, probably a remote trigger, things that I have (flashes, not triggers), but that I found tedious to haul around.

It's not that much easier this way, maybe much to the contrary. I suppose it is easier to learn lighting such a scene with flashes, than it is to learn how to achieve it in Photoshop (and you still need a decent exposure to begin with), but I like pondering about images, studying them, and when I've made up my mind, creating the image according to my vision. And all this happens in the comfort of my warm apartment. Probably that's the real progress ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/sophisticated_lady.html">Sophisticated Lady</a>" (<a target="_blank" href="/2009/11/1141-take-a-train-ii.html/comment-page-1#comment-4647">this time really</a> a Duke Ellington composition ðŸ™‚), sung by Ella Fitzgerald in her 1958 "Birthday Concert" in Rome, Italy. That's a great record. I mean, I like her, even in her most commercial studio albums, but Ella live on stage, that was a very different thing.
