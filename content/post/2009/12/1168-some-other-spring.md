After the cold at the weekend, this is quite a contrast. This is probably not the right title. "It Could As Well Be Spring" would be better, but I only have it in versions that I can't find on YouTube ðŸ™‚

 It's dark now, Christmas Eve, I am slowly making my way to Charinthia, or rather the train is, and I just want to thank you for the support through all these years. I wish you peace, joy and some easy days. I know it won't happen for everyone, there will be grief and sorrow in the world, but at least I may wish for it.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/some_other_spring.html">Some Other Spring</a>" by Billie Holiday. You find it on every other collection of her songs, and of course it's on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EP_cYGPzrU">YouTube</a>.
