I'm neither creative nor productive at the moment. I'm not even polite. The unread blog posts pile in Google Reader, and where I read, I hardly comment. I have not much time. I play <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/">Morrowind</a> again. It's old, it does not have the latest effects, but it is still one of the best and most addictive Fantasy Role Playing Games of all times.

 The Image of the Day was taken yesterday evening in Villach. I'm pretty sure I would have liked it better with less of a tilt, with much more above the left corner included (imagine the dark trees in the background straight), but I would have had to include lots of bright, white streetlights along the upper edge, and that would have ruined more than helped. Well, you can't always get what you want ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/by_the_rivers_dark.html">By The Rivers Dark</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 2001 album "Ten New Songs". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEsNn4Nk3T0">YouTube</a>.
