Gloomy, rainy days in Vienna, what would I do without this pawnshop in Josefstädter Straße?

It's a place I pass by late on my way to work, and when I am not sure that I have another good candidate, I always have a look into this shop's window.

 This is a composite of two exposures, one at f2.8 and one at f5. Additionally I have accentuated the sharp foreground with a healthy dose of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.topazlabs.com/detail/">Topaz Detail</a>. Speaking of which, they have recently released Version 1.1 of this plugin. It it is advertised as substantially faster, well, maybe, but it's still slow. Other than that, they have added a new high-contrast, high-detail, near-monochrome preset. If you own a license, you should have been notified by mail. The upgrade is free.

The Song of the Day is "Bird's Nest" by Charlie Parker. I have it on my 168 CD collection called "The Ultimate Jazz Archive". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp4FEzoPIHo">YouTube</a>.
