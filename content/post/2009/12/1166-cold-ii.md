It's a lie. It was not cold yesterday, but it was cold three days ago, and that's what I want to talk about.

 Today there was a discussion on Photo.net (in <a target="_blank" href="">this thread</a>) about problems with a Nikon D80 camera sometimes not recognizing a mounted Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC. The original poster mentioned having had the problem in cold weather, and that immediately reminded me of my own experience during the last few cold days. 

What happens is, that the Nikon D300 suddenly displays an aperture of 1.2, just like with unrecognized, unchipped lenses. I suppose that it really is the cold that makes the metal on lens and mount shrink slightly. This could possibly lead to bad contact. Or is it just the cold affecting the lens' internal electronics? I don't know. What I do know is, that I have already seen this with a Tokina 16-50/2.8, with my Sigma 10-20 and also with my Nikon 18-200 VR. I can only remember the circumstances with the Sigma: it was on a mountain in winter, and it was extremely cold.

 I can't look into this issue at the moment. Out temperatures have risen considerably during the last two days. Does anybody of you have similar experiences? 

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/maxwell/cold.html">Cold</a>" from the 2009 Maxwell album "BLACKsummers'night". I have added the numeral II to the title, because we had it once in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/02/859-cold.html">859 â€“ Cold</a>", although with a completely different song then. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56mHAm3Dn0Y">video</a>.
