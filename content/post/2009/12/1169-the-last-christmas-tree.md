Here in Carinthia it's colder than in Vienna, and in the morning - when this image was made - there was still some snow left.

This is a place across the field from our house where Christmas trees were sold, and only one seems to be left. Good job ðŸ˜„

 In the meantime the snow is all pretty gone, not because of warm weather like in Vienna, no, it's because we had heavy rain all through the day.  No weather to go out, and indeed I didn't ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricstime.com/sensational-alex-harvey-band-there-s-no-lights-on-the-christmas-tree-mother-they-re-burning-big-louie-t-lyrics.html">There's No Lights On The Christmas Tree Mother, They're Burning Big Louie Tonight</a>" from the Sensational Alex Harvey Band's 1972 album "Framed". See a very intense live performance from the Marquee on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s6WMCSGUlQ&feature=related">YouTube</a>. Sound quality is meh, but that can't take away from such greatness ðŸ˜„
