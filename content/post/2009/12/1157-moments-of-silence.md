You know this habit of mine, taking a song title, making it the title of the Image of the Day, making the song Song of the Day. Well, today is different and this is, because I got stuck in the middle.

I have a file with all my song titles. First I search this file for keywords that I feel match my image. When I have found something, I look if I can find a video, preferably on YouTube. I also check in my <a target="_blank" href="/index-of-the-songs-of-the-day">Index of the Songs of the Day</a> if I have already used the song. If so, I may use it again or look further.

But still, I got into the mood quickly, and taking photos was an intense experience, almost meditative, out in nature, first on a small country road, then in a forest by the river. It was an experience of silence and joy. 

 Well, "silence" was one of the words that I looked for in my list of song titles, and when I found Shara Nelson's album "What Silence Knows", I immediately loved the idea. The problem is, that the title track was not available on YouTube. In fact, the only song from that album that's on YouTube, is "One Goodbye In Ten", and when I heard that, I knew I wanted it to be Song of the Day. It's such an incredibly beautiful song, and if you don't know the album, I can only recommend it heartily. Here's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51ZJJVFFACY">the video</a>.
