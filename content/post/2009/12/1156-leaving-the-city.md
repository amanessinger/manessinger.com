This is not an image of today, this is another image of Friday, still from Vienna, taken from the rear of the tramway as I approached the railway station. Today I was lazy, played computer games, slept in the afternoon, and in the evening I attended <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freiaudio.com/">Andreas Frei</a>'s annual Christmas party. 

I mentioned <a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080117_210512_ps.jpg">Andreas</a> several times, he is the guy who just made the post-production for the movie "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mountstelias.com/">Mount St. Elias</a>" (where he contributed two songs), recently produced singer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeannolan.com/">Jean Nolan</a>'s album "<a target="_blank" href="http://jeannolan.wordpress.com/born_ready_poll/">Born Ready</a>", is a great musician himself - and just a good friend. It was a great evening, except for photography ðŸ˜„

 On the other hand, in a way this image is also an image of today, because only today I remembered that I had taken it at all. It was still on the camera, because at the time that I took it, I had already decided to make yesterday's "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/12/1155-born-to-be-wild.html">1155 â€“ Born To Be Wild</a>".

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/roisin_murphy/leaving_the_city.html">Leaving The City</a>" from RÃ³isÃ­n Murphy's 2005 album "Ruby Blue". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0U3E9zCWcg">YouTube</a>.
