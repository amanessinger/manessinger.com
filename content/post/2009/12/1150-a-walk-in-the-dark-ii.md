Sunday progressed pretty like Saturday. There was a short time of sun, but when I left home, it was already over. I made some wide-angles of a bridge and hoped to get away with it.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091206_203411_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091206_203411_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In the evening, like all Sundays, I took the taxi to the railway station and found ... no train. Hmm ... December 8 is a Catholic holiday, and 20 years ago the shops used to be closed. Not so any more, but many people still have the day off, especially in public service. This makes Monday a bridge day that people also tend to take off, thus creating a long weekend, and that, of course, lowers traffic, which ultimately made the railway company eliminate my train.

 Instead of using the taxi back, I took a nice walk in the dark, through Villach's well-decorated center. That's where I made these images. 

It's Monday now, almost 2pm, and I am finally on the train to Vienna, having taken the day off myself.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/a_walk_in_the_dark.html">A Walk In The Dark</a>" from David Byrne's 1992 album "Uh-Oh". I know, I have <a target="_blank" href="/2009/01/838-walk-in-dark.html">already used this song</a> and it would not have been that hard to find another title, but it's so good, I just had to ðŸ™‚

Hear it as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-7G95VSw98">second part of this video</a> on YouTube.
