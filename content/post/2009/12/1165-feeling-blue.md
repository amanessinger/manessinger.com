I'm back in Vienna. Remember when I said it's only six days and then the days will get longer again? Oh my, time flies, from tomorrow they will.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091221_084958_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091221_084958_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Image #1 is a morning image. I was late and very much in a hurry. Hmm ... how are these called? It's not exactly graffiti, it's more like someone's tag, a signature. I guess "an annoyance" would Ted say ðŸ™‚ But still: how do you call something like that in English?

Anyway. I focused on that orange something, waited a second or two until the man was just in the right position, and then I took the image. I don't even have an idea what it is about. It's just an arrangement that appeals to me - something that I do time and again. Must mean something, huh?

 The Image of the day is one of those cases when I like to use Nikon Capture NX 2. I liked the colors and tones of the JPEG from the camera, but I wanted to crop the image slightly. In such cases I don't crop the JPEG and save as JPEG again, no, I always use the RAW file. The problem is, that I currently use ProPhoto RGB as my working color space, thus the camera profiles in Adobe Camera RAW do not match as they are supposed to do. Capture NX 2, on the other hand, perfectly reproduces the look of in-camera JPEGs.

The Song of the Day is "Feeling Blue" from Eric Burdon's 2006 album "Soul of a Man". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgVjj8kuphM">YouTube</a>.
