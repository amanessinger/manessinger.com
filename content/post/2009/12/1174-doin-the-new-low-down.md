I'm on the train to Carinthia and that's an image taken this morning.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cab_calloway/doin_the_new_low_down.html">Doin' The New Low Down</a>". I have it on a CD called "Harlem Story". Amazon does not have it, but Google gave me a hit on <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/harlem-story/id290933511">iTunes</a>. But that's not what you should hear anyway, because searching on YouTube, I found what must be the definitive version: The Mills Brothers with Cab Calloway. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg1Y5L_2_qI">Enjoy</a>!
