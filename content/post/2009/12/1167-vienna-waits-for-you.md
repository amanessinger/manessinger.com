I'm on the train to Carinthia. It's been a little complicated, the train was shorter than expected, I stood on the wrong end and had to go through the seven cars, all through to the front, but now all is well. I sit in the only car with electric current, in the right place at the window to have space for the mouse, I can work and I have an internet connection. The place was marked as reserved, so although  hundreds of people must have walked by, nobody sat down. I found out though that the reservation was for the other direction, Villach to Vienna. A lot of luck, I'd say ðŸ™‚

 I saw this bicycle yesterday when I left work. It looks like the bikes that those foreign, underpaid people use, who deliver our newspapers since the privatization of postal services. I have no idea why someone has sprayed "Vienna" on it, but it's always nice to know where you are ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billy_joel/vienna.html">Vienna</a>" from Billy Joel's 1977 album "The Stranger". 1977?? Oh dear, I'm growing old. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0yvjk6mzKE">YouTube</a>.
