Well, some days it's less, some days it's more. Today it's more ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091201_080103_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091201_080103_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Actually these are images of yesterday, all taken in the morning while I went to work. These are not even all images, I could have gone on, but I just had to stop. This is supposed to be a daily blog after all, and I am already a day behind.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091201_080456_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091201_080456_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The lone balcony is here not for its qualities as an image, no, it's here, because it fascinates me. It's kind of a functionless architecture, an architecture that was normal a hundred years ago: you know, these balconies that were pretty useless, much too narrow, more decoration than anything else. In the meantime we have learned to appreciate balconies as an extension to our apartments. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091201_080626_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091201_080626_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Normal balconies are big enough for at least a table and two chairs, and then there must still be enough space to walk by. Not so here. A lone yellow chair, that's it. And then it's a north side too. I'm pretty sure though, the landlord charges a premium for it anyway.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091201_081226_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091201_081226_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The first two bicycle pictures are really the same bike, one time lit by the headlights of a car, thus the different colors ... 

... time passes ...

... Oh dear! I must have been tired. It's morning now and I have not even looked at yesterday's images. Not much time to chatter now, but that may be a good thing anyway ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20091201_082552_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20091201_082552_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The mannequin of the Image of the Day is in the window of some shop, I believe a hairdresser. I had to remove the lens hood and press the lens flat to the window, without any chance to compose. There was no other way to get rid of the reflections, especially as the insode was much darker than the outside. It is a relatively tight crop, but I still like it.

 And that leaves the last image. "<em>The Hunter Just Returned</em>". ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/who/too_much_of_anything.html">Too Much Of Anything</a>" from the 1971 album "Who's Next" by The Who. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q86hQOlLac">YouTube</a>.
