Follow your instincts, huh? This post is named "Twilight", because the image of the light on the chair in front of a shop in Vienna was destined to be Image of the Day, but when I looked at this uncertain, wavering path between all obstacles, I felt again why I had taken the image in the first place, and I just couldn't reduce it to a thumbnail.

This is probably more about me or about life than everything else. This is the Image of the Day.

I suppose these old houses will be gone by next year, replaced by a modern apartment block like those behind.

I took more images like this. It's hard for me to tell what the point is. It is simply that I walk and look and see, and suddenly an inner voice tells me to "photograph this". It reminds me of Paul Butzi's recent post "<a target="_blank" href="http://photomusings.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/fuzzy/">Fuzzy</a>".

It's about rationalizing the photographic process <strong>after the fact</strong>. It strikes a chord for me. Seeing is not analytic. It's Go, not Chess.

 When I changed the Image of the Day, the Song of the Day, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/vanessa_carlton/twilight.html">Twilight</a>" from Vanessa Carlton's 2002 album "Be Not Nobody" should probably have been changed as well, along with the title, but then, I like it, and thus we go on with the incongruity ðŸ™‚
