I'm still trying funny things. Well, in a way I always do, but normally I make my images by composing through the viewfinder.

 Not so in this image. I would have had to lay down on the ground. Basically I held the camera very low, at an angle to about everything, pressed the shutter and hoped for the best. Of course this is the monkey method, and of course the results of such things are rather random, but then maybe not.

 This was actually the first take, so I was really lucky, and if I have anything like a style, you will probably recognize it. It may be the monkey method, but after all, I was the monkey ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Low Rider's Blues" by Blind Willie McTell. I have it on disc 43 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", but if you insist, you can also get it on a single CD, for example "The Best of Blind Willie McTell". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7P9gRq_8kU">YouTube</a>.
