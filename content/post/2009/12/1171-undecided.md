I didn't go out today. I've played games, worked on some images (just reproductions of some old family images), and now, on the train to Vienna, I have processed a combination of three images taken yesterday afternoon. None of these images seemed good enough for an Image of the Day (well, probably the bridge), thus I tried combining them into a triptych or some other arrangement.

<div class="container">
<div class="center"><a target="_blank" href="/display.php/1200x1200/2009/20091226_130301_ps_horizontal.jpg"><img style="margin: 10pt 10px 10pt 10px;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0400x0400/2009/20091226_130301_ps_horizontal.jpg" /></a></div>
</div>

I finally ended up with two versions, one strictly horizontal, one more concentrated towards a squarish shape.

The problem is, that my raw material consists of one vertical and two horizontals. That's what you get when you combine them. These images were taken to stand alone. None of them particularly lends itself to being cropped to a square, thus the natural solution, both <a target="_blank" href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/">hobsonesque</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">byrnish</a>, combining three squares, does not apply. And even if, and even with today's stupidly wide screens, it is still hard to properly present a panorama or a wide triptych on screen. Any preferences? Any ideas?

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/undecided.html">Undecided</a>" by Ella Fitzgerald. I have it in a 10 CD box that's not available internationally, but of course there are lots of collections available.
