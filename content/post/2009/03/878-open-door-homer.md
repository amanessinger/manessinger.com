Yes, it works fine in many cases where the fish alone would not, but composing for it is a very experimental thing.<br/><br/>I try to always shoot more than one image, and that solves part of the problem. On the other hand, more images means more processing. Normally I go through my images after copying them from the card, and I immediately delete what is never going to be used.<br/><br/> With this approach I can't do that so easily. Some images that look like rubbish straight from the fish look quite OK when treated with this filter. This is one of the reasons why it took me so long to come up with this image ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Btw, we had the same type of elevator in "<a href="/2009/01/816-starting-all-over-again.html" target="_blank">816 - Starting All Over Again</a>". That image had been shot with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, and here it is the Nikon 10.5/2.8 fisheye. Same focal length, but look at how much wider this is! Again, this is pretty useful.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/robyn_hitchcock/open_the_door_homer.html" target="_blank">Open the Door, Homer</a>" from the 1967 "Basement Tapes" by Bob Dylan and The Band.
