These are two images of yesterday, both made with the fisheye, both treated with <a href="http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_hemi.asp" target="_blank">Fisheye-Hemiâ„¢</a>. They will certainly not be the last, but at least for the next days you may see me shift to a very normal angle. The reason is simple: I got my Nikon AF-S 35/1.8G. What a marvelous little lens! But more about that tomorrow.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090310_083623_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090310_083623_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The first image, a morning image, is somehow crude and unbalanced, but it strikes me as strangely surreal. After all, what is surrealism if not the combination of things that normally don't go together? I like it and then not. This is a kind of image that I like to keep as a marker in my mind. This is not what I really wanted, but it is a way to go.<br/><br/> The second image was shot in the afternoon. The sun already stood low and cast a warm glow on the Natural History Museum. I had left work early, because I couldn't wait to get my new lens. <br/><br/>When shooting in such places, it usually does not take too long until some people come along and end up in just the position that you want them to. I spare you the details of processing, it's just as usual, only that this time I have taken the blur much further into the image, especially on the left side. This has two effects: it softens the harsh contrasts, and it gives the building more of an ethereal glow.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kinks/sunny_afternoon.html" target="_blank">Sunny Afternoon</a>" by The Kinks. I couldn't believe that I have not used it so far, but it's true. See a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h1oRP7FfBw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
