The Image of the Day, more or less a type of postcard shot, shows the view to the north, against the Austrian border.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090314_162207_photomatix_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090314_162207_photomatix_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> This is a rural area north-west of the small town of Tolmezzo. I have added <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=108716966416095170910.0004651da8b5ed9d3438a&ll=46.530524,13.41156&spn=0.860688,2.114868&z=10" target="_blank">a map</a> that shows the trip. There are two placemarkers, one for my home in Villach and one for the village of Sutrio. <br/><br/> The Image of the Day was shot just before I reached Sutrio, the other image, the church with the stairway, is the church of Sutrio.<br/><br/>Both images were shot with the Sigma 10-20. The church is an HDR merge of two bracketed exposures. The perspective was corrected in Photoshop, at least for the church itself. I have left some distortion on the stairway. Looks more interesting that way.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beirut/postcards_from_italy.html" target="_blank">Postcards From Italy</a>" from the 2006 Beirut album "Gulag Orkestar". A fabulous piece of music from a truly fabulous album. See the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjzVbXeD_8E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
