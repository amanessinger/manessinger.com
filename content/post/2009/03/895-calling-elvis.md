At least I managed to get one image in the morning.<br/><br/> Snow had gone, for a change we were back to rain, thus you get one more umbrella image. This time it's even a double umbrella image ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dire_straits/calling_elvis.html" target="_blank">Calling Elvis</a>" from the 1991 Dire Straits album "On Every Street". See them live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTnrlGqNPOk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
