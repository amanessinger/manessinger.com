Weather in Vienna was - and still is - rather uninspiring. That's always a good time for some B&amp;W architecture shots. You may recognize the tint, it's the same tri-tone as in "<a href="/2009/02/867-perfect-couple.html" target="_blank">867 - The Perfect Couple</a>".<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090302_165207_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090302_165207_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I left work early and went down to Mariahilfer Straße, one of the most important shopping streets in Vienna and at the same time the border between the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 7<sup>th</sup> district. For those of you who don't know Vienna, I should note that the 7<sup>th</sup> district is on top of a hill and the 6<sup>th</sup> is where the hill falls down to a small river. The difference in height is not dramatic, maybe 50 meters, but it is enough that you see stairways all along this line south of Mariahilfer Straße.<br/><br/> One of the more elaborate stairways is at the beginning of the street, going down to Rahlgasse.<br/><br/>I stood there for quite some time and shot a series of images, always in search for a single person on the stairs, in a dynamic place and pose. I got nothing spectacular, but these are the two shots that remained.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/down_down_down.html" target="_blank">Down, Down, Down</a>" from Tom Waits' 1983 album "Swordfishtrombones".
