This image was taken east of Klagenfurt. It was the only part of Carinthia where it did not rain. <br/><br/>Villach is just in the direction where we look, approximately below the darkest cloud ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Wayside shrines are frequently seen in the alpine region, but Carinthia is especially famous for its big number of them. This one is of a rare kind though: it is similar to those seen in western France. Instead of being built from bricks, like a small tower, it is hewn from stone. I believe there are not more than maybe ten of them among the (I hope to remember right) about 700 in Carinthia.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/randy_newman/my_country.html" target="_blank">My Country</a>" from Randy Newman's stellar 1999 album "Bad Love".
