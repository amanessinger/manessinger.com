Well, I did, but only for shopping. In Austria shops in tourist centers are allowed to open on Sundays, and actully that's a blessing. I arrived from Vienna yesterday night, and now, while I'm writing, I'm on the train back again. Time in Carinthia was sparse and I could not muster the energy for a photo shooting outside.<br/><br/>Instead I wrote yesterday's blog entry, dozed a little in the sun, lying on a camping bed on the balcony, and in general tried to relax.<br/><br/> The Image of the Day is once more the view from the window in the study, facing east at about 5:30pm. I took a whole series of images while the clouds rapidly changed. This one was the best. It actually looked quite nice in color, but after I had given it my current standard B&amp;W treatment, I decided to keep it at that.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Robert Burns' poem "<a href="http://www.links2love.com/poetry_184.htm" target="_blank">The Winter it is Past</a>", sung by Eddi Reader on her 2003 album "Eddi Reader Sings The Songs Of Robert Burns". There is a new edition with seven bonus tracks, celebrating this year's 250<sup>th</sup> birthday of Robert Burns, and I'll link to that instead of the original album that I have. See a video of Eddi performing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkDpyGQ1pBY&hl=de" target="_blank">live in Glasgow</a>. Quality could be better, but you'll get the idea.
