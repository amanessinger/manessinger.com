"Gedankensplitter" means "aphorism" and this is an image that I am not really sure what to make of. Actually it's a composite of two images. The person was in another image of the series, and the best version of the yellow angle was in this one. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090327_073953_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090327_073953_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Call it cheating, but that's one of the reasons why I like to shoot more than one image of a scene, especially when I've got people in it.<br/><br/>I said, I don't know what to make of it. Well, it has a certain surreal quality, and then maybe not enough of it. On the other hand, I like to take some risks and see where it gets me. In this case I'm not sure ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090327_071625_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090327_071625_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The other two images are again using my current B&amp;W process. Another half-naked scooter and some plants in a pot in the backyard of where I live in Vienna.<br/><br/>Just like in the Image of the Day, geometry was what made me take the image of the scooter. I really like the angle in the lower right corner, actually a part of a blue letter "Z" painted on the street.<br/><br/> The motivation for the other image was different. It somehow reminds me of baroque decorations in images of, say, Rubens. You know, all these fruit and foliage decorated around ancient heroes. It's probably hard to explain and it may not be in the image but in myself, it may be an association that can only be constructed in my head, but on the other hand, most relations between an image and a viewer work like that. They are always essentially private.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the old Merseybeats hit "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/really_mystified.html" target="_blank">Really Mystified</a>", interpreted by Elvis Costello and The Attractions on one version of the 1982 album "Imperial Bedroom". I say on one version, because the remastered version currently available stops with track 15, while my version, the one that I have linked to, contains a whopping 24 tracks, "Really Mystified" being track 19. The Costello cover is not available online, but YouTube has the original by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiMvciMvgi0" target="_blank">The Merseybeats</a>.
