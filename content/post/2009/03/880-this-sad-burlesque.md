We had two lately, the <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/02/faireyand-garciavs-the-ap.html" target="_blank">affair about the original image</a> that was used by Shepard Fairey for the famous Obama "HOPE" icon, and <a href="http://greg.org/archive/2009/01/08/richard_prince_sued_for--what_else--appropriating_photographs.html" target="_blank">Richard Prince being sued</a>, but of course this comes up every once in a while. <br/><br/>Now, the question really is, when is using art in arts simply appropriation and plagiarism, and when does it produce a work that stands for its own? Is this something to be avoided? And if so, is it just to play safe, or do you feel a deeper moral obligation? Or is art just another subject of art?<br/><br/>Well, I don't know if Rembrandt had objected against my use of a poster for his exhibition, but I guess I would not object against finding one of my images in a Rembrandt painting ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Both of today's images were shot with my new Nikon AF-S 35/1.8G. This is a fine lens and I may write more of a review-type post this weekend, but to wrap it up in one statement I might say: If you are a Nikon DX format shooter, get this lens!<br/><br/>Both of today's images? Well, yes, the Rembrandt poster with the traffic in the background, and the image of the trees that I have overlaid ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/this_sad_burlesque.html" target="_blank">This Sad Burlesque</a>" from the 1993 Elvis Costello / Brodsky Quartet collaboration "The Juliet Letters". I have no more samples than what Amazon provides (click the ad), but YouTube has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oWXuJ2Kfdo" target="_blank">live performance</a> of another piece from the album. This is one classic album not to be missed. Highly recommended!
