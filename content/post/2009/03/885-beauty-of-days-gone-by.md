Yesterday in the <a href="/2009/03/884-is-you-is-or-is-you-aint-my-baby.html" target="_blank">first part</a> we have looked into sharpness, and there was certainly nothing to complain about. <br/><br/>The Image of the Day is actually one more exercise in sharpness. I have converted it with Adobe Camera RAW and then done my usual B&amp;W treatment of lately. Don't let the image fool you, there is no corner softness and no vignetting in the original, that was all made in Photoshop ðŸ™‚ <center><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090316_170250.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090316_170250.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090316_170225.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090316_170225.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090316_170215.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090316_170215.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090316_170200.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090316_170200.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></center> For today I have promised to look into bokeh. We have already seen some in my night shot "<a href="/2009/03/880-this-sad-burlesque.html" target="_blank">880 - This Sad Burlesque</a>", that was wide open and with near point light sources, something where most lenses look good, but today it is a more interesting subject, a criss-cross of twigs, photographed at f1.8, f2.8, f4 and f8.<br/><br/> The thumbnails link to full-size images, so you better click on them. The last, f8, was taken at high ISO. I used Auto-ISO at a lower speed limit of 1/200s. Those little things move incredibly fast in the slightest wind, and I really wanted to get the sharp parts without motion blur.<br/><br/>Looks good to me. The Sigma 50/1.4 performs still better, but I can't call this bokeh unpleasant. Not at all. On a scale from one to five with five best, I would call this a solid four.<br/><br/>Sharpness OK, bokeh fine, I guess we should look into CA tomorrow, shall we?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/the_beauty_of_the_days_gone_by.html" target="_blank">The Beauty Of The Days Gone By</a>" from Van Morrison's 2002 album "Down the Road". I didn't find a video, but Deezer has it from some three CD collection "Still on Top: The Greatest Hits". It's <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/102760" target="_blank">track 12 on the third disk</a>.
