Any idea? But whatever it is, 4554 is the Number of the Train, that's for sure ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Yup! From southern sun back to northern cold. Ouch, that hurt! We even had snow in the morning, and actually quite much of it.<br/><br/>Photographically this wasn't my best day either. In the morning I was in a hurry, in the evening my brain hurt from hunting other people's bugs in a heap of highly toxic code. Oh well!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is one more time "<a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/bonnie_prince_billy_lyrics_47112/other_lyrics_84166/cold_and_wet_lyrics_830596.html" target="_blank">Cold &amp; Wet</a>" from Bonnie "Prince" Billy's 2006 album "The Letting Go". The last time I used it on an image of our <a href="/2008/01/449-cold-wet.html" target="_blank">poor little cat</a> ðŸ™‚
