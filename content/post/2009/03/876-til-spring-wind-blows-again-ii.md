These two images are from yesterday, Saturday, early afternoon. It was a bright, sunny day, I had some business in Klagenfurt, and on my way back to Villach, I passed the highway for some good old country roads.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090307_151633_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090307_151633_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I had not yet given up on the fisheye, but my hopes for a usable image were low. You know, the fisheye does not particularly lend itself to landscape photography ... or so did I think.<br/><br/>Both of these images were shot with the fish, both were converted in DxO Optics Pro, but without the default rectilinear mapping, and then they were run through <a href="http://www.imagetrendsinc.com/products/prodpage_hemi.asp" target="_blank">Fisheye-Hemiâ„¢</a> again. All the other treatment is the same as in the last shots (yes, I'll be back to color again, don't worry), but the spectacular thing is really how Fisheye-Hemi turns the fish into a perfectly usable general-purpose landscape lens. Sure, it's wide, in fact it's ultra-wide, but that's the whole point of it, right?<br/><br/> Just look at the trees! They're straight. That's what we expect. The landscape, the horizontal lines, they still bend, but that's completely unimportant <span style="font-weight:bold;">especially in a landscape</span>. Nobody could tell how those lines are in reality anyway. All that counts is, that familiar things look familiar, and here that's what the trees look like.<br/><br/>Sorry for bothering you with that plugin for the second time, but I'm simply thrilled. It's like having bought a new lens ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It's another second time for the Song of the Day. Again it's "'Til A Spring Wind Blows Again" from Clarence Bucaro's new album "'Til Spring". We had such warm spring winds yesterday, I could not help but being reminded of this song. <br/><br/>The album is finally out now and you may really like it.
