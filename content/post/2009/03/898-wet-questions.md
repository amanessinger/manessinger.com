It pours like mad outside, even worse than it did the rest of the day ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090329_130023_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090329_130023_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> These two images were shot early in the afternoon. I figured that the raindrops on the movable blinds of the balcony, along with some heavily out of focus background, could probably save me from having to go out.<br/><br/> After two weeks of frantic work on toxic code, I'm terribly behind with blog reading. Sorry if I didn't turn up at your blog in a long time, currently I have a backlog of 726 unread posts in Google Reader.
