<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090305_175611_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2009/20090305_175611_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>As promised: after 24 images with the Nikon 24/2.8, I needed something new, and I really went with the fish. <br/><br/>One of the three blog posts of yesterday was made in the morning and, being pretty much in a hurry, I took the Underground for work. I saw this image in the morning, took two versions, but none was usable. One even included my feet and the paper bag with my breakfast ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>That's the hardest part when using the fisheye: keeping out what you don't want in the frame. I returned after work, and I was very thankful for the image, because in mid-afternoon it had begun to pour down, making outdoor photography a little inconvenient.<br/><br/>That in post-processing I went for toned B&W again was not planned from the beginning, but when I tried it, it worked so well to play down colorful peripheral elements like a red emergency telephone at the upper end of the elevator, that I stuck to it.<br/><br/>All these last images had a B&amp;W conversion layer, usually with a filter like "Maximum Black", a gradient map with the same tri-tone gradient, all had a layer with a strong 50px gaussian blur applied liberally along the edges, all had 10% monochrome gaussian noise added at 70% opacity, and in all cases I have applied levels and contrasts in normal blending mode <span style="font-weight:bold;">after the gradient map</span>, thereby intensifying colors where I have accentuated contrast. <br/><br/> This has become more or less a recipe and it works exceedingly well. In yesterday's image I have mixed it with distorted edges, today I have increased local contrast, but the basic recipe is always the same. I should really turn this into an action ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Tanita_Tikaram:Something_New" target="_blank">Something New</a>" from Tanita Tikaram's 2005 album "Sentimental". I've just heard the whole album while working on this post, and I think it's really a shame that I seemingly did not sell so well. It is temporarily out of stock at Amazon, but some Amazon market place dealers have it for reasonable prices around $10, from at least one, Caiman (in Florida, where else), I have bought in the past. <br/><br/>Enjoy the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKhNKa79yro" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. You won't regret it.
