Turned up at work at 8am, left at 7:45pm, achieved ... nothing. Well, at least nothing but a deeper understanding about how bad it is. That's a day, huh?<br/><br/> On the other hand, it already began bad. Rain in the morning, but why complain? At the same time in Carinthia fell snow ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>And it's days like these that I'm really thankful for the existence of bicycles. Sometimes I'd despair getting an image without their kind help, without their cute poses.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.justsomelyrics.com/1975073/James-Whiteboy-Lyrics" target="_blank">Whiteboy</a>" from the current James album "Hey Ma". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puSa8C9GqWg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
