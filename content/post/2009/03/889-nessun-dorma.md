If any song at all, this was his signature. Basically you can take any of his recordings, but why not the one from the original Three Tenors concert? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uVxIVhYUuA" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has it for you.<br/><br/> On the other hand, what I really wanted to show you, was Lester Bowie's spectacular rendition on one of his last albums with the Brass Fantasy, "The Odyssey Of Funk & Popular Music". This is pure genius! Unfortunately I can't really demonstrate it. YouTube has nothing at all, there's nothing on Deezer and Amazon won't give us sound samples. There is a 30 seconds sample from the beginning on <a href="http://mp3shake.com/en/Lester_Bowie's_Brass_Fantasy/136627-Nessun_dorma_mp3_download.html">MP3Shake</a>, one of the Russian music download sites, but you really would have to hear the whole almost seven minutes. You can get it on iTunes, or otherwise you'll simply have to believe me ðŸ™‚
