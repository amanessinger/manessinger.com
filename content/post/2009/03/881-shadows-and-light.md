We had a beautiful sunrise, rain as I left home, then again some sun while I was on my way, rain later and in the evening ... you get it.<br/><br/>It was one of the short moments of blinding sun. I wanted to take an image of something completely different, when in a second the sun was there and I saw people coming my way and the shadows that they cast. I made three images, this being the best.<br/><br/> Basically there was not much choice of composition. I had the 35/1.8 mounted, people and their shadows were moving, the sun could have been gone in an instant (actually it happened just like that), there was only one option: shoot regardless, and do everything else later in post-processing.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joni_mitchell/shadows_and_light.html" target="_blank">Shadows and Light</a>", originally from Joni Mitchell's 1975 album "The Hissing of Summer Lawns". There is also a 1980 live double album of that name, where she performs together with Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays and The Persuasions. I didn't know about that, but I've just ordered it from Amazon. YouTube has the very compelling version from that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO-aSVFCDxw" target="_blank">live concert</a>.
