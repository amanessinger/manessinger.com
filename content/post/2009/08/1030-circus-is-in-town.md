We've asked, it's OK to take pictures as long as you don't use flash. That's fine for me, I never would ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Other than that, we'll see Michael today and the day's gonna be busy.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was taken from the tripod, using a cable release and an ND grad filter. You may recognize the view from the window of my study ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/circus.html" target="_blank">Circus</a>" from Tom Waits' 2004 album "Real Gone". Oh dear, is this man good. Hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmJOnZCcgw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
