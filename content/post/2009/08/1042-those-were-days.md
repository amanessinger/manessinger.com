Today was just this: a beautiful and hot summer day. Hopefully there are more to come, but even if not, it will have been a great summer.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090820_164004_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090820_164004_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Searching for a Song of the Day I began with my newest CDs, and the title "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dolly_parton/those_were_the_days.html" target="_blank">Those Were The Days</a>" stuck.<br/><br/>Recently, when I wrote "<a href="/2009/07/1019-both-sides-now.html" target="_blank">1019 - Both Sides Now</a>" and searched for a video, I found out that this Joni Mitchell tune had been interpreted by countless people, among them Dolly Parton and Doris Day. This caused me to buy CDs of both of them, and today's Song of the Day is the title track of Dolly Parton's 2005 album of cover versions.<br/><br/> I also found a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R43ec1inV-Q&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, and there disaster struck: Have you ever heard "Those Were The Days" by the Leningrad Cowboys and the Russian Red Army Choir? Live in Helsinki 1993?? The Total Balalaika Show???<br/><br/> Oh my, speak of definite versions ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It caused me to immediately order the CD (get the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Total-Balalaika-Show-Helsinki-Concert/dp/B00005B7SG" target="_blank">double CD</a> from Amazon.de!!) and the DVD. The DVD contains only half of the concert, but the problem is, you really have to see them. Unfortunately "Those Were The Days" is not on the DVD, but of course <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEORJ3_EQ_A&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>And while you're there, don't forget to see some of the other songs from this concert. Basically you find the whole concert among the "Related Videos".
