Walking to work, letting loose, following my intuition, that's really what makes a day, and normally it also brings interesting results.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090825_075330_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090825_075330_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The lantern hangs in the entrance hall of a building around the corner from home. The image was taken with ISO 560, but I had to severely push it, probably far beyond 6400, because the upper part was so dark that the lantern did not separate at all. Of course this pushes noise like mad, thus I have covered my tracks with Alien Skin's <a href="http://www.alienskin.com/snapart/" target="_blank">Snap Art</a> filter. That's not the intended use of this filter, but I can tell you, it's pretty effective ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090825_080500_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090825_080500_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The bicycles went the B&amp;W route because of the multi-colored background. The bikes did not separate in color, in B&amp;W they do pretty well. Add Topaz Detail, Topaz Adjust, a vignette, some artificial noise and a silver tone and you have it.<br/><br/> Finally, the Image of the Day is one more of those half/half compositions that made a big part of my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> book "Urban Dreams II". Seems more like some technical marker than your typical graffiti, but I have no idea what it means.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/melissa_etheridge/when_you_find_the_one.html" target="_blank">When You Find The One</a>" from Melissa Etheridge's 2004 album "Lucky". See a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Eab4Ks0J8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. It's some fan video with content from "South of Nowhere", but the music is genuinely Melissa Etheridge ðŸ™‚
