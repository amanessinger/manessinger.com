For this image I have used the original ISO 3200 image without noise reduction applied.<br/><br/> These old walls have so much texture, noise reduction would have made more harm than the noise itself. Instead I have emphasized the texture with "Interior Strong Detail", a <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/detail/" target="_blank">Topaz Detail</a> preset, and thrown in some of <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/adjust/" target="_blank">Topaz Adjust</a>'s "Spicify". It does not look entirely natural anymore, but I suppose it gives quite a good feeling for the place.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Steps Steps Down" by Barney Bigard. I have it on disc 32 of the "Ultimate Jazz Archive", my trusty treasure chest of 168 CDs full of Jazz history. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYWSnaNuaw0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
