Does it happen to you, that you come to a place that has long been your home, and that your inspiration is simply there, no effort needed?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090830_163840_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090830_163840_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Today I needed an image and I also wanted to go swimming. I had enough time, and so I decided to make a detour through the region where I have lived for 20 years. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090830_162159_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090830_162159_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> It's so much easier there. I don't need to search for places, I know them. I know where the flowers are, where the water is and I know what to expect under what conditions. It's home.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090830_162808_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090830_162808_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> And although I know the places, there are still some puzzles left: I have made many images of this fence, and I have not liked a single one. These I do, because they show the essence of this fence, the roughness of old wood, the repetition of the always different, the straight and the crooked.<br/><br/> I don't mean to imply that one should not go on travels, I'll do next week, and I don't mean to say that all people are equal, but at least for me, these home places are much more important for my work than all travels. Sometimes it takes you years to find out how you want or need to photograph a place. How can you expect to go abroad and get it right the first time?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/old_love.html" target="_blank">Old Love</a>" from Eric Clapton's 1991 live album "24 Nights".
