To be honest, I still felt a certain dizziness from the evening before ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This was the last image that I took in the morning, and I was so sure to have my Image of the Day, that I didn't bother much looking in the afternoon. In fact it was the last image that I took today.<br/><br/> I have already used that bike one or two times, and when I saw it today, and when I thought about what it was, that caught my attention, then it became clear that it was the saddle with its springs. Looking for a fresh view, I decided to go near and photograph it straight into the eye.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eels/that_look_you_give_that_guy.html" target="_blank">That Look You Give That Guy</a>" from the 2009 Eels album "Hombre Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire". Damn fine music. Christian and I heard it yesterday, you hear it today on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wREjT7DlI7M" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
