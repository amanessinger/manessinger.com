It took it with the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro, that fabulous lens that I have not used in a year because it is so heavy. There is a tremendous amount of isolation, helped along with judicious use of <a href="http://www.topazlabs.com/detail/" target="_blank">Topaz Detail</a> on the bicycle only.<br/><br/>The original color image had two strong colors on the frame, yellow and dark blue. While this didn't look bad at all, I found the colors to distract from the bold, simple lines. Thus the conversion to B&amp;W.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/you_got_the_silver.html" target="_blank">You Got The Silver</a>" from the classic 1969 Rolling Stones album "Let It Bleed".
