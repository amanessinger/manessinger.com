While Dobratsch has been a nature reserve for about 20 years, Gerlitzen is still used for skiing - and it shows. In summer you can drive right to the top at about 1900 meters, and on beautiful days like today, the sky is full of paragliders.<br/><br/> I used the Nikon 70-300 VR, set the camera to continuous autofocus with automatic focus selection, activated focus tracking, and this way I made 150 mostly boring images. It was a great training though, because these are settings that I normally don't use.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/robbie_williams/straighten_up_and_fly_right.html" target="_blank">Straighten Up And Fly Right</a>" from Robbie Williams' 2001 album "Swing When You're Winning". This album was an earth-shattering success in Europe, while in the US he was ignored as usual. This explains the ridiculous price for the import CD. Thus you may be much better off buying the normally priced digital download. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1f-7ejxEGE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
