Yes, nothing more. We had rain today, though I was lucky in the morning as well as in the afternoon, but on both occasions I was in a hurry. The result is ... only a bicycle ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Hmm ... I did promise a bicycle book, did I? It's funny: <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> is over and the impetus to make books is gone. There will be another SoFoBoMo next year though, and who knows, maybe I can really pull myself together and do it earlier, without an external event. By the way, as there was a recent discussion, how do you call someone who participates in SoFoBoMo? A participant, sure, but do you have any better ideas? Something witty or cute? Something you wouldn't mind to be called? If you have an idea, leave me a comment please. No prices though, sorry ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ray_davies/see_my_friends.html" target="_blank">See My Friends</a>" by The Kinks. I have it on the 2003 "Ultimate Collection". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0ySEqRAtzk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
