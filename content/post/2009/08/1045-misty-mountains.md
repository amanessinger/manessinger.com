Cruel things happen around us all the time, most of them going unnoticed. And even if, a wasp is dangerous, just look at the colors. Our compassion is only for the furry, cuddly animals with big eyes. <br/><br/>In case you're interested: this ended 1:0 for the wasp. It finally got free.<br/><br/> The other image is more like what I was looking for in this early morning after a rainy evening. I set out so early, because I hoped to get scenes just like this: mountains shrouded by wind-torn mist.<br/><br/>Just like yesterday's image (which actually also was from today), this is a rather brutal re-mapping of tones, certainly much more dramatic than it was in reality. While yesterday's challenge was to isolate the birds, today I wanted a certain balance between the cliff in the foreground and the bright spot in the sky.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/led_zeppelin/misty_mountain_hop.html" target="_blank">Misty Mountain Hop</a>", originally from the 1971 album "Led Zeppelin IV". I have it on the 4 CD collection "Led Zeppelin Remasters". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mw3a6V7FOw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
