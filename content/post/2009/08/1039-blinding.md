It's almost two months past summer solstice and it shows, but it's hot again in Vienna and it seems to last for some more days, hopefully even weeks.<br/><br/>Do you ever take pictures directly into the sun? I've read that it may blind you, it may destroy your sensor and all sorts of things. Well, I still can see, my camera still takes pictures and I love it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.songlyrics.com/florence-the-machine/cosmic-love-lyrics/" target="_blank">Blinding</a>" from Florence + The Machine's 2009 debut album "Lungs". Hear the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da6bBKLPEGg&feature=related" target="_blank">album version</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN7QcNCTVUw&feature=related" target="_blank">live version</a> on YouTube.
