No circus image, sorry. What more can you do than ask? At the beginning of the show though, they announced that taking photographs is forbidden "for copyright reasons".<br/><br/> What do they expect me to do? Copying their acrobatic tricks? Acting like the clowns they are?<br/><br/>I was furious at first, but then ... I simply enjoyed the show. No focus, no exposure, no camera settings, no hunting for pictures. Just plain fun, and that was not bad either ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cyndi_lauper/money_changes_everything.html" target="_blank">Money Changes Everything</a>" from Cyndi Lauper's 2005 album "The Body Acoustic".
