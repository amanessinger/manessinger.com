I had risen extraordinarily early, spent hours writing my post and hearing the Leningrad Cowboys. All the while the sky grew lighter.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090821_074116_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090821_074116_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I changed back to the Sigma 28/1.8 to capture the sky gradient. It's not a particularly good composition or such, it's just a sky at the time when clear skies are most beautiful.<br/><br/> Later, when I went to work, I used the Nikon 70-300 again. This bicycle is a good old fried, the last time we had it, was in "<a href="/2009/01/831-just-one-of-those-things.html" target="_blank">831 - Just One Of Those Things</a>", and that was already the second time, but a good actor can be employed more than once ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/blues_before_sunrise.html" target="_blank">Blues Before Sunrise</a>" from the 1997 John Lee Hooker album "Don't Look Back".
