Yesterday I had one of those rare meetings with my friend Christian. Actually I had forgotten the date, and when he met me at work, I was pretty surprised and embarrassed, because I was supposed to be the host.<br/><br/> Thankfully the shops were still open and I could go the the next supermarket to fetch some edibles and some wine. It left me damn short time for photographing though. In fact this image was taken while I walked back home. Note to self: Never go out without a camera, even if it's only to the supermarket ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beck/the_golden_age.html" target="_blank">The Golden Age</a>" from Beck's 2002 album "Sea Change".
