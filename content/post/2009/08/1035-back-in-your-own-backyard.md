I'm afraid he's right. We had rain in the afternoon and evening, and it has cooled down substantially.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090813_154835_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090813_154835_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The first image was taken in the afternoon, during one short spell of sunshine, while I was on my way to the passport office. I need a new one and now I get one of these biometrically secured passports with encoded fingerprints. Oh well.<br/><br/> The other image is from the morning.<br/><br/>I may be known for my fascination with bicycles, but I certainly have a fascination with doors and doorways as well. I like these half-covered views into semi-private spaces. It is not voyeurism, have a look at it, there is nothing to see here, but it is the idea that these places, strange to me, have complete familiarity to some other people. It's not my home, but it's a home to someone. Sure, this is only assigned meaning, but isn't all meaning only assigned?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/back_in_your_own_backyard.html" target="_blank">Back In Your Own Backyard</a>" by Billie Holiday. I have it in one of those 10 CD boxes that I recently got for 10â‚¬ each. I have looked, the most affordable variant on Amazon is another 10 CD box for $60, but at least you get a 100 pages booklet, and $6 for a CD is still a nice price. Hear the Song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjIN31HWnD4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
