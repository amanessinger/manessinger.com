I will use only one lens (OK, I do that all the time), and it will be one unruly monster of a lens, the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro, a lens that has found an almost permanent residence on a shelf in Villach ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090819_181004_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090819_181004_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> You see, I'm back to longer focal lengths, and in the meantime I use the Nikon 70-300 VR. It's fun to be where I was in <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a>.<br/><br/>I always use this lens at a minimum of 1/200s. With VR I could go further down, especially when I am at the short end, but at the long end, at an equivalent of 450mm, 1/200s is a speed where I can be sure that I am able to hold every image.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090819_180928_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090819_180928_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Of course you need a lot of light to do that, but summer is the season of light, if I can't do it now, I can't do it at all.<br/><br/>The Sigma 150/2.8 is a different thing. It has no VR, at 895g it is heavier than the 70-300, but I really look forward to use it wide open. <br/><br/>Long lenses make photographing really easy, because they eliminate all the context. It's more a matter of getting used to the frame, of seeing in terms of long lenses, but once you are over that, it becomes pure bliss.<br/><br/> If that sounds strange, try it at one time. If you don't own a long lens, consider buying a stabilized 70-300. <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a> has the Canon version on his 40D and he is excited about its performance, I can say the same about the Nikon 70-300 VR, you really can't go wrong, and especially when you use it on a crop factor camera, it is a bargain entrance to long reach.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/fleetwood_mac/the_chain.html" target="_blank">The Chain</a>" from Fleetwood Mac's mega-seller "Rumours". I have the remastered album with an extra CD of rough versions. That's what I've linked to, but if you're not a real fan, the normal CD for half the money will suffice. Isn't it amazing how inventive this industry is, when it comes to selling ever the same things once more?
