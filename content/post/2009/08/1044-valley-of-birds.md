This is an image of today, and another one of today will follow in the next post.<br/><br/>Yesterday I spent most of my time at the computer, creating a Windows XP virtual machine with one of my old XP licenses. A virtual machine (I use Sun's <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>) is a convenient thing to have. You can use it to execute programs of dubious origin, you can use it to safely surf, and whenever you have the feeling that the machine is compromised, infected by a virus or a trojan horse, you simply wipe it and restore it from an export.<br/><br/>I wanted to do that for a long time, now finally I have, but it is incredible how long it takes to install Windows. OK, I started with a pre-SP2 installation medium, installed SP2 from CD, and then SP3 and all patches up to now via Windows Update. And of course Windows always wants to chat with you in between. Talk of tedious.<br/><br/> In the end I only managed to drive to the lake, swim a little, and then the big rain came. It only lasted for a few hours, but the amount of rain was impressive ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image was taken on a short trip in the very morning. Obviously it's a crop, not a stitched panorama ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.getalyric.com/mp3/lyrics/songs/the_stranglers-5029/written_in_red-53337/valley_of_the_birds-245494/" target="_blank">Valley Of The Birds</a>" from the much underrated 1997 Stranglers album "Written In Red". See them live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfjB5ldSFmU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
