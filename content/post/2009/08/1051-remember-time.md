One from my archives, one from mid May last year. We had pouring rain today and I have not made a single image.<br/><br/> Sometimes when I already have an image of the Day and when I am tired, lazy or when I have no time, I put promising images that I can't process on a TODO list. <br/><br/>This is one of these images, and I guess that I got a better result today than I could have got last year. One of the reasons is a micro-contrast adjustment made with Topaz Detail, and then I may have gained some experience since then. I ended up with an 18 layer job and an image that I am quite satisfied with.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.elyrics.net/read/m/michael-jackson-lyrics/remember-the-time-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Remember The Time</a>" from Michael Jackson's 1991 album "Dangerous".
