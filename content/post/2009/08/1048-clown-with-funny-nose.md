I had some technical problems and it took me a while to get connected to the Internet again, yes, to even get my images off the memory card. Hmm ... a digital camera without a card reader or a USB cable is pretty useless, but so is a film camera without a lab ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Interestingly enough, using the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro I am much more prone to actually make macro images than with the 70/2.8. Must be the increased working distance. There were lots of dragonflies on a cable, baking in the sun, and I saw some people taking images with compact cameras, but when they came too much into the comfort zone of the insects, they normally flew away. No problem with the 150 though.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/edith_piaf/bravo_pour_le_clown.html" target="_blank">Bravo Pour le Clown!</a>" by Edith Piaf. I have it on a collection that is not available any more, but almost any collection will do, for example "The Voice of the Sparrow: The Very Best of Edith Piaf". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgrzzA6H-Fw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
