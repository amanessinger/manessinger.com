I'm in Carinthia, none of these images will go into my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> book.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090516_153653.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090516_153653.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Yesterday's weather was mixed, and part of the day I was haunted by a cloud above me that seemed to track my movements. It's pretty frustrating seeing a nice blue sky with interesting clouds scattered in between, but a landscape that lies in shadow. The result is a lack of color and a strong tendency to underexpose the landscape or overexpose the sky.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090516_191318_photomatix_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090516_191318_photomatix_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Sure, you can help yourself with split neutral density filters, you can do HDR (and the last image is one indeed), but it's not just the same.<br/><br/>Still, I managed to get a few shots. The first image, the trees on the hill, is an unprocessed JPEG right out of the camera, the second is an HDR image mapped with Photomatix Pro's tone compressor algorithm, the sky only a tad darkened in Photoshop.<br/><br/> The Image of the Day is of a house near one of our most favorite restaurants, "Hicks'es Wirtshaus" in Hart south-west of Villach, near Finkenstein.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/blinded_by_the_light.html" target="_blank">Blinded By The Light</a>" from the 1973 Bruce Springsteen album "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.".
