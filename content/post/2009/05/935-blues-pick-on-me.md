It's Friday morning and I am still posting images of Tuesday. Oh dear!<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090505_064749_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090505_064749_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> These are again images taken with the 70-300 VR on a sunny day. Actually I really like some of them, may drop others, some may not fit at all into the final collection, and then there may be some images that I have missed.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090505_065736_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090505_065736_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The way I work (apart from shooting) is simple. I copy the day's images on my hard drive and incorporate them into my image database. I use <a href="http://www.photools.com/" target="_blank">IMatch</a> as DAM program, but everything that allows for keywording and searching for keywords across directories will do. <br/><br/>After copying, I skim over the images and label them as SoFoBoMo '09 candidates.<br/><br/>In the first run I don't care about anything but these images. If by the end of next week I feel that I severely lack images, I'll come back to the original collection later, but for now I go strictly to the candidates.<br/><br/><center><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090505_162424_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090505_162424_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090505_062903_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090505_062903_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></center><br/><br/>So where's the blues, you ask? Well, first, there is the delay. I hate delay, but in this case I can't help it. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090505_161953_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090505_161953_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Second, some of these images gave me a hard time. Basically my plan is to do mindless shooting first, and only then to see if I can turn the omnium-gatherum into a meaningful sequence. It's only not as easy as it sounds. While I'm shooting, there is always the impulse to immediately judge it in conjunction with the book. <br/><br/>My best corrective is, to compulsively follow every impulse. For a split-second I may question the possible value of a subject, but then I take the picture anyway.<br/><br/>It does work, really, but it produces a bigger amount of images than usual. Normally during the week I have one or two fits where I produce more than one or two images, the other three or four days there is only one Image of the Day and possible one side image. Over the years I have learned to cope with that. <br/><br/> At the moment it is five, six, seven, eight images that I need to process and post per day, and that slows me down, and that causes delay, and ...<br/><br/>"The Blues Pick On Me" by Peppermint Harris is the Song of the Day. I have it on a box of ten CDs called "<a href="http://www.bigboxset.co.uk/product/296548/RHYTHM_AND_BLUES_ORIGINAL_MASTERS_10CD_SET" target="_blank">Rhythm &amp; Blues - Original Masters</a>", a real treasure box that I have recently bought at a regular price of 10€ (yes, 1€ per CD!). It does not seem to be available in the US, thus I have linked to a four CD collection called "Ham Hocks and Cornbread" that has it on disc three. <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/172300" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the whole disc for you to hear. The song is track 29.
