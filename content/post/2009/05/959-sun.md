This was Friday morning. I didn't shoot much more that day, it was a travel day as usual, although I saw a breathtaking sunset when arriving in Carinthia, confined to the train and helpless as usual ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Regarding "Urban Dreams", I think this is definitely a <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> candidate. I may use this or <a href="/2009/05/951-when-sun-comes-out.html" target="_blank">last week's image</a>, probably even both.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.soapandskin.com/static/lyrics_the_sun.html" target="_blank">The Sun</a>" by the young Austrian singer Anja Plaschg, aka Soap &amp; Skin, to be heard on her March 2009 debut album "Lovetune for Vacuum". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw71o2dVNTw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
