<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090519_153150_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2009/20090519_153150_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>It's Wednesday morning, 5:45am, I've been up for an hour now, so has the sun, thus we'll try to keep this short and sweet ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090518_163551_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090518_163551_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Let's begin with two more images of Monday. The first is one more time about the dream of the sky, the urban dream of being on top, although this is a very humble version.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090518_072917_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090518_072917_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The other is a detail of a motorcycle. The good thing about photographing these things with such a long lens (it's the Nikon 70-300 VR at 300mm again) is the long working distance. You can inspect it: everything is curved and shiny, but you can't see me anywhere reflected in all that chrome. This would be impossible to do with a shorter lens.<br/><br/>And with motorcycles we go on. Here's another one: a detail image and the whole thing. I found it yesterday and I could easily have taken many more shots, but I ran out of time. Honestly, this is not a motorcycle, this is a landscape ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><center><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090519_074205_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090519_074205_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090519_073842_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090519_073842_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></center><br/><br/>On the <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> front there is nothing new to report, at least I do not have any InDesign templates. Processing seven images kept me busy yesterday.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090519_073159_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090519_073159_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I guess I will take most of the images as I have processed them so far, i.e. I won't try to re-work them into a common visual style. I will only group them loosely by the "kind of dream". <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090519_072253_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090519_072253_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Other than that, I still have not decided if I do a one-image-per-spread layout, i.e. the classic photo book where no image interferes with the other, or if I juxtapose images. The latter is more ambitious and harder to do right, but it opens up a whole world of expression. We'll see. I'll try both.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "In Our Dreams" by Emily Loizeau. I recently found her while following the recommendations on Deezer. They have both of her albums, the debut "L' Autre Bout du Monde" and her current release "<a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/271820" target="_blank">Pays Sauvage</a>", the one that contains this song, but at the moment they won't play them to me. I don't know why, it may be because I have already heard them some times.<br/><br/> Actually I can't figure out how Deezer works. They have a help page, but they don't explain why I can hear some songs some of the time but not all of the time. It may be license related, it may be due to a technical problem, because the website has just gone into maintenance mode ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Whatever it is, I don't care. In the meantime both CDs have arrived from Amazon, I have already ripped them, and all is well. <br/><br/>After Deezer have sorted out their technical problems, I'd still recommend you hear into <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/271820" target="_blank">the album</a>. It has a wide variety of styles and it is really great music. If that does not work, here is a video that I have found on <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6rej2_emily-loizeau-in-our-dreams_music" target="_blank">Dailymotion</a>.
