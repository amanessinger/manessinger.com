I barely found anything usable for rainy Thursday, this is the lone contender and at 24mm the only "wide" <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> image so far.<br/><br/> I had made three remarkably bland shots of this blue scooter in front of the equally blue "Honk", only a slightly rotated square crop could save me a half-decent way out.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/country_honk.html" target="_blank">Country Honk</a>" from the 1969 Rolling Stones album "Let It Bleed". This is the country version of the probably more familiar "Honky Tonk Women". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnWK1iJDcWs" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has a slightly different recording, still country but without the fiddle, and <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/259466" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the whole thing for you.<br/><br/>This is one of those half a dozen classic Stones albums, I guess you really have to hate them in order to not like it ðŸ™‚
