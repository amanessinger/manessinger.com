The sky began to be colored nicely. I took the 70-300, pulled all the way to 300mm, and took some shots of the three trees on the roof garden at the other side of the block. I have done this more than once, but none of the images has ever been particularly good. Neither have these, but as it grew brighter, I watched the spot every once in a while. The next couple of shots was better, having a nicely textured sky, and then ...<br/><br/>... and then the sun came out. I made three exposures in short sequence, the whole thing lasted not even a minute. This is the best of the three, with the sun just in the right position.<br/><br/>Today is a public holiday in Austria. I was on a trip out in the country, I made some 70 images, but I haven't been very inspired, and I actually enjoyed snapping away, relaxed, well knowing that the Image of the Day was already taken, processed and uploaded.<br/><br/> None of the country images could be <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> stuff anyway, and after my morning image, everything else would only have been a bonus, thus I leave it at that.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the Harold Arlen song "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/harold_arlen/when_the_sun_comes_out.html" target="_blank">When the Sun Comes Out</a>". I love the Ella Fitzgerald version from the "Songbook" series, I adore Barbra Streisand's artistry, but today it is the voice and the soul of Judy Garland. See her on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb90J9MmXG4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>EDIT: Oops! I just found out that I have used this title and this song in Judy Garland's version already once in <a href="/2007/11/384-when-sun-comes-out.html" target="_blank">384 - When The Sun Comes Out</a>. Well, tastes rarely change ðŸ™‚
