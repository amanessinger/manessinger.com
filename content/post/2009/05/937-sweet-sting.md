The lake may have about 17 degrees Celsius, the water feels definitely warmer than it was when I was there at the end of September.<br/><br/>In the evening I was held up, because the populist madness of censoring the Internet (allegedly for fighting child pornography only) has swapped over from Germany to Austria. I have spent more than two hours writing a long mail to one politician, Gottfried Hirz of Upper Austria's Green party, whom I absolutely would not have expected to vote for that craze. I took great lengths to explain the situation, we'll see what answer I get.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090507_071715_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090507_071715_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> But anyway, let this be not about censorship, let it be about <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a>.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sick of playing catch up and always being three days behind. You know, when I am photographing, I always think a lot. I think about things that I could write, I have inner monologues about what I see, what I shoot, why I shoot it, why I shoot it this way, what I want to tell you, and when I get home, I forget all that, because what I find and what I need to write about, are the images of three days back. This is frustrating.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090507_072735_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090507_072735_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Thus, the new method is, that I won't try to keep up the illusion that text and images were from the same day. If I need to talk about something that happened at the day that I write the post, I'll simply do so.<br/><br/>Back to the images. I could really have gone on processing images of Thursday, there are at least four contenders left, but for now it's enough.<br/><br/>All these images were shot with another favorite lens of mine, the Sigma 50/1.4. The Image of the Day is not exactly what I'd call a snapshot, but it was the only way to react to a certain situation. The machine moved, the train moved, seeing, composing, shooting, that was all within one second - and now I greatly like this cruel instrument.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090507_073434_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090507_073434_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The Bicycles? Well, maybe more my dream than anyone else's, although Ove has <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/books/ovepove/lifecycles/" target="_blank">similar obsessions</a> ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The graffiti images maybe need some explanation. The second one would have been the Image of the Day, but unfortunately I do not own the Elton John album "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player". If I did, I would have named this image (and the whole post) "Crocodile Rock".<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090507_074033_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090507_074033_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The third graffiti image is definitely an "Urban Dream", although it presents the old problem of language. How do you cope with an image  that contains text, written in a language that 90% of your audience won't understand?<br/><br/>I have no ready solution but to explain it, and that may well lose the point. Anyway, the text means "Less work, higher wages, self-determination of workers", a revolutionary, leftist parole, that looks so incredibly out-fashioned on this wall. It is not by accident that this is the wall of a house that belongs (or belonged) to our communist party. Communist romantics, in a way ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090507_073716_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090507_073716_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The next image is more a puzzle than a dream. It contains a typical element of my photography, the bicycle, and then some signs seen from behind, and a poster spelling "Gesucht" or "Wanted". I like this image. It is <a href="/2009/02/845-what-it-is.html" target="_blank">dense</a>. It is opaque. It tries to keep you out. It breaks rules. I love it.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090507_160350.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090507_160350.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The last image is the only one that I didn't process at all. It's the JPEG right out of the camera. It's colors are true to what I remember, but now that I see it, I might as well have pushed saturation a tad.<br/><br/>This also brings up the question if (or if not) these images are the final renditions that will go into the book. Honestly, like so much these days, I don't know. Last year's "<a href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/tscheppaschlucht?mode=embed&amp;documentId=080615094752-71bb975bcb574a92a12e8b84cc696d08&amp;layout=grey" target="_blank">Tscheppaschlucht</a>" was really easy. Just shoot a bunch of images in a given sequence within a short time, all in one place, all under very similar lighting conditions, all within a small range of subjects, and then process it to a common look. Tedious but simple.<br/><br/> This time it can be everything. I may find a meaningful sequence of subjects and styles, I may have to re-work many of the images into a "look", or maybe I can bind it with text. I have no idea, or rather, I do have ideas, many of them, but I don't know yet which of them may apply.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tori_amos/sweet_the_sting.html" target="_blank">Sweet The Sting</a>" from the 2005 Tori Amos album "The Beekeeper".
