It only rained a little, not nearly as bad as Thursday, but it still forced me to use an umbrella.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090515_070801_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090515_070801_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Other than that, Friday marks the end of the first half of my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> effort. <br/><br/> I had two working weeks of shooting in Vienna, ten days, 63 processed images so far, almost twice as much as I need, some candidates are left to choose from, in case that I need a certain color or subject, and of course I won't suddenly stop now, but I may ramp shooting down to the usual blogging level. This will save me a lot of time that would otherwise go into processing.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day shows a window hook in my stairwell in Vienna, thus the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/leave_it_open.html" target="_blank">Leave It Open</a>" from Kate Bush's 1982 album "The Dreaming".
