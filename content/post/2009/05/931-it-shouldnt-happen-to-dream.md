Remember my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> project? It's going to be called "<a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/books/amanessinger/urban-dreams-ii/" target="_blank">Urban Dreams</a>". Well, this day marks the begin of the earliest possible "fuzzy month".<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090501_165636_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090501_165636_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I'm still in Carinthia and making trips to the surroundings. On Saturday I thought I'd start right away, and I would do it on a trip to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, a city with a population of about 270.000, and thus certainly qualified for the term "urban".<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090501_173414_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090501_173414_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Boy, did I fail! We started by visiting the castle on top of the hill in Ljubljana's center, there in the park I made the Image of the Day. When we finally got down into the city, we had only a very short time, as a thunderstorm was approaching. <br/><br/>When we returned to Villach, we did not take the direct route through the tunnel, but instead left the highway at Jesenice, from there followed the river Sava up to <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=46.510917,13.885002&spn=0.219741,0.52803&z=12" target="_blank">Kranjska Gora</a>, and via Podkoren we crossed over to Carinthia at Wurzenpass. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090501_175122_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090501_175122_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The river image is from river Sava, <a href="/2009/03/869-river-deep-mountain-high-ii.html" target="_blank">again</a> you see the typical color of the water in the region. <br/><br/>The view of the mountains is from the ascend to Wurzenpass, looking back to Kranjska Gora, and the final image, the road with the fence, was already taken in Carinthia.<br/><br/> Where does this leave me relative to SoFoBoMo? <br/><br/>I like all four of today's images, the mountain image is quite a bit conventional, but I like the other three a lot. On the other hand, clearly none of them qualifies as an "Urban Dream". My original idea was, to use mostly images of Vienna, and thus to start on Monday, when I'm back again. In any case, one thing is clear: I have not started SoFoBoMo on Saturday ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "It Shouldn't Happen To A Dream" from the 1962 Anita O'Day / Cal Tjader album "Time for Two". <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/248106" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the album.
