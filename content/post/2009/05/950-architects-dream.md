Oh my! We're getting somewhere ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090520_065037_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090520_065037_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> It's morning again. I've just seen the sun rise between the roofs of Vienna, you'll see the image in the next entry.<br/><br/>Yesterday was one of those days at work. I tried to analyze a problem, while doing so, was asked to fix an error, and while doing so, I encountered a strange condition where the whole system behaved in a strange way. Trying to analyze that, I used a test program, only to find out, that it had stopped working with the last server change and ...<br/><br/>Believe me, you don't want to know ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090520_184021_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090520_184021_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Accordingly, my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> book layout progress is naught. I have some more images though. They are mostly about that dreamland where the city meets the sky, only the Image of the Day is different, but in a way it has a dream-like quality as well. Or maybe not. Or maybe still, because these are my damn' dreams, and when I say it's a dream, then it's a dream ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If that sounds a little bit arrogant, well, I believe there is one important point to consider:<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090520_181720_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090520_181720_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Whenever you dabble in a field of art, you are ultimately on your own. Art is not a democratic process, neither is creativity. When you decide to make a book about dreams, then you can't ask people, please, I'm making a book about dreams, can you help me, is this a proper dream? It doesn't work like that. It just begins with the fact that nobody will understand the word dream the way you do. <br/><br/>And here we are with the problem of language again. Our spoken or written languages use such single words like "dream" to represent concepts, but whenever you look deeper into it, whenever you want to be specific, precise, you find out that all these represented concepts are only generic. They are agreed-upon averages. They are not precise. You have to use more than a single word to be specific. It may be a sentence, it may be a book.<br/><br/> As an artist, you can't ask other people about meaning. In order to do so, you would have to be extremely specific, and by doing that, you would give up your mode of detachedness, the very thing that you need to be creative.<br/><br/>Art is created in a declarative way. You can't ask, you say so, and if it's good, then it will be recognized as true. If not, well, you've made an experience ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/an_architects_dream.html" target="_blank">An Architect's Dream</a>" from Kate Bush's 2005 album "Aerial". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTQuXr0pDuw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. And: Please can this woman make more music?
