We ate Frigga, the traditional lumberjack meal made of bacon, cheese, onions and potatoes, served with polenta or bread. <br/><br/> I made only a few images, well knowing that I wouldn't have the time to process them anyway. Still, when I saw this seller of knife sharpeners, I could not resist. He sold a sharpener, I got an image ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This is one of those images that are very easy to process in B&amp;W and without extensive background treatment hard to do in color. I had the Nikon 24/2.8 mounted, thus no chance to work with shallow DOF, and of course it is also impossible to get a clean background with all the crowds around. The dress of the woman was brightly red and as distracting as it gets, but the B&amp;W conversion together with some blur nicely took care of that.<br/><br/> The other image is of the parish church in Hermagor. I made some more from the inside, but nothing really convincing.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Selling That Stuff" by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney's_Cotton_Pickers" target="_blank">McKinney's Cotton Pickers</a>. I have it on disc 13 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", the 168 CD treasure box that I bought for 99â‚¬. You can still buy it for around that price in Europe, while in the US it sells from $220. Still a nice price for that number of CDs ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The other possibility is a CD called "McKinney's Cotton Pickers 1928/1930", selling from $20 used and $73 new. Ouch! <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/42931" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has that album for you to hear.<br/><br/>Finally you can download this song (and supposedly many others) for free from the audio archive of the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/SellingThatStuffByTheMckinneyCottonPickers" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>. You can hear it there as well.
