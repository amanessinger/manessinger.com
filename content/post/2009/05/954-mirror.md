From the train I just saw a breathtaking sundown, a little provocative after a steamy, hot day with dull, overcast sky ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> I don't really care though. I was exhausted from yesterday anyway, I could not even convince myself to go swimming. Accordingly, the image that you see here was not shot today. It's out of my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> reserve, one of the images that I made on May 4, the day that I began my fuzzy month.<br/><br/>And now please excuse me, I want to use the rest of the time on the train to define the layout for my book. This time for real ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/mirror.html" target="_blank">Mirror</a>" from the 1997 Beautiful South album "Blue Is the Colour". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6IjQN_oIy8&hl=de" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has it for you.
