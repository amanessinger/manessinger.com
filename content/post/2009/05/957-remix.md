That's not so bad though. The layout is basically done, what I now need is a balanced choice of images.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090527_184053_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090527_184053_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The poster for my original "Urban Dreams" exhibition last year showed <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071219_190709_ps.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a>, and in a way its composition, basically a landscape format with two halves, was an inspiration for this year's whole effort. <br/><br/>I already have some of those images, yesterday's is an example, but I found that I need more of them. They represent the dual nature of the dream concept: not what people in the city dream to have or to be, rather my own visual dreams of the city. This is an aspect that is important to me. <br/><br/> On the other hand, when I selected those anchors, images that undeniably need to go into the book, there was no bicycle among them. This could well mean that I leave the bicycles for Ted's bicycle book ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/wyclef_jean/maria_maria.html" target="_blank">Maria Maria (Wyclef Remix)</a>" from the 2003 album "Ceremony - Remixes & Rarities" by Carlos Santana.
