Does any of these images qualify? Actually I don't know. I am struggling with "<a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/books/amanessinger/urban-dreams-ii/" target="_blank">Urban Dreams</a>", my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> book. No, it's worse, I am struggling with the very basics: How do I get a sequence out of a bunch of images?<br/><br/>I have played around with grouping in Adobe Bridge and with manual "Lighttable" sort in <a href="http://www.photools.com/" target="_blank">IMatch</a>, my image database, but that will only take you so far. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090522_160006_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090522_160006_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I guess my problem is not grouping. After all, when I have found groups, what am I supposed to do? Sequence inside of the groups and then string the groups together?<br/><br/>Apart from the obvious problem, that the applied categories are not sharp, have overlaps, it sounds rather boring to me, a little bit like pointing with fingers, and it gives up on possible dramatic effects, on implied stories. It's not what I'm going to do. But then, what else?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090522_162723_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090522_162723_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> At the moment I have 85 images processed and published since May 4, the day that I began shooting with the project "Urban Dreams" in mind. Some more sleep unprocessed and I could pull them out if I need more of a certain kind. I will make some more in the remaining 12 days, today included, although three of those days will be spent in Carinthia, thus we're down to 9. If I happen to come up with good candidates, I really plan to make changes until the last possible moment. That makes for at least about 100 images.<br/><br/> My next step will be to simply begin a book. I will use the measurements that Blurbs <a href="http://blog.blurb.com/index.php/2007/04/24/look-no-further-for-full-bleed-page-specs/" target="_blank">specifies</a> for their 8x10 inch landscape book. This is not very big, in fact it's rather small, but I just held a book with polaroids by Manual Alvarez Bravo in my hands, and I found it to be very comfortable to hold.<br/><br/>I will begin by selecting safe candidates that must go into the book. Then I will try to surround them with what feels good, makes sense, tells a story, juxtaposes them, whatever. Finally I'll try to bring those strings into a sequence. We'll see how far I get with that ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If you wonder, today's title is a line from the Sex Pistols song "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sex_pistols/satellite.html" target="_blank">Satellite</a>". I really like the version from their 1996 reunion tour "Filthy Lucre", but your taste may be different. YouTube has a video of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRHuLC2J8p4" target="_blank">original</a>.
