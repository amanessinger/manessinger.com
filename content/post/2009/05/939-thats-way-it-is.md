In a way at least. I was quite busy non-photographically on Saturday, I didn't manage to shoot great varieties of images, but I have no problem with that.<br/><br/>The sunrise image is, like so often, a look from my study. It was 5:55am. Boy, is this sun already high! On the other hand, in only six weeks is  summer solstice. Time is fleeting ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The other image, this forest way, was taken in the afternoon. I have used the Nikon 24/2.8 for both images. It's not more than a "good enough" lens, but it is small and light. That's a nice contrast to the Nikon 70-300 VR that I've hauled around most of the week before.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Ella_Fitzgerald:That%27s_The_Way_It_Is" target="_blank">That's The Way It Is</a>" by Ella Fitzgerald and the Ink Spots. I have it on another of these 10 CD boxes for 10â‚¬. 10 CDs of old Ella Fitzgerald recordings, and there is no overlap with anything else that I have ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The only source that I could find on Amazon is a four CD compilation called "The Golden Age of the Ink Spots". <a href="http://www.deezer.com/track/that-s-the-way-it-is-T2939584#music/album/285821" target="_blank">Deezer</a> has the song on another album, but that seems to be unavailable on CD.
