I don't know the exact temperatures, but I know how summer feels. This was positively summer ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090517_143541_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090517_143541_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> After last night's editing and posting frenzy, I slept long, and then I did some <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a>-related research on <a href="http://www.blurb.com/" target="_blank">blurb.com</a>, I found out that things are pretty much as they were last year. Their bookmaking software BookSmart still does not export PDF (or anything that could be converted to PDF), thus there is still no way around using some kind of layout software, exporting the PDF to a bunch of JPEGs, one for each page, and then importing those JPEGs into a blank layout.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090517_145325_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090517_145325_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> OK, thus the road is clear: I'll do the layout in Adobe InDesign, create a PDF, upload it to <a href="http://issuu.com/" target="_blank">Issuu.com</a> and to <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo.org</a>, and then I'll try to get it on paper. I'll try Blurb this time, as they really let you sell the book online. Not that I expect to sell any, but simply being able to offer it is tempting. I vaguely remember that you can even get an ISBN and sell it via Amazon, although I currently find no hint on their site. Or was that another service? Anybody knows?<br/><br/> Anyway. That's where I am at the moment. I guess tomorrow I'll create an empty template in InDesign, that will just happen to have the right dimensions for a medium size landscape book on Blurb.<br/><br/>I spent the rest of this beautiful Sunday on the road. The plan was to drive to our lake for some swimming, but I was so immersed in photographing and zig-zagged along only the smallest roads, that in the end I had to turn return before having arrived at the lake.<br/><br/>I made quite some images, some more would have had potential, but I'm tired and leave it at that: a lonesome forest road and some spring flowers. Hope you like them.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madeleine_peyroux/lonesome_road.html" target="_blank">Lonesome Road</a>". At first I tried to find the Anita O'Day version online. Bad luck though. Thankfully I happen to have it by Madeleine Peyroux as well. It's on her second album "Careless Love". I found a live version on YouTube, but it's overlayed by loud clapping that completely destroys the song. Just go to Deezer, they have the <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/100127" target="_blank">whole album</a> in very good quality.
