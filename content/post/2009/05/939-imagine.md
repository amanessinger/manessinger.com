We've already talked about those dreams of escape, those pieces of nature that we keep in our cities. Today there is a focus on another dream: the dream of being on top, the dream of the sky.<br/><br/><center><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_071751_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_071751_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_070502_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_070502_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_070358_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_070358_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_072008_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_072008_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt;"/></a></center><br/><br/>Contrary to how I normally title my images, it was just this group of roof and sky photos, that gave name to the Image of the Day. Remember the Lennon line:<br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_071141_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_071141_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> <blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Imagine there's no heaven<br/>above us only sky</span>"</blockquote> Yes, he means another thing, I know, but still, the line comes to my mind whenever I think about sky.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_072051_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_072051_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Obviously the subject fits into the "<a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/2009/books/amanessinger/urban-dreams-ii/" target="_blank">Urban Dreams</a>" topic of my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> effort. How I should tie all that together, especially with all stylistic differences, that still has to be seen ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_072424_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_072424_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Form balconies in the sky, via a bicycle on a balcony (yes, it is really on the second floor of where I took my "Crocodile Rock" one day before), and then down to bicycles on the ground. Very much on the ground, I'd like to say. Isn't that a nice, natural flow ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Really, I might use that in the book ðŸ™‚)<br/><br/>Can you remember when I wrote in "<a href="/2009/04/921-baby-im-fool.html">921 - Baby I'm A Fool</a>", that the Sigma 70/2.8 Macro would be my single SoFoBoMo lens?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_143853_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_143853_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Turned out I was wrong. I have used it on the first rainy day, but my by far most productive lens during the last week was the Nikon 70-300 VR. As much as last year's "<a href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/tscheppaschlucht?mode=embed&amp;documentId=080615094752-71bb975bcb574a92a12e8b84cc696d08&amp;layout=grey" target="_blank">Tscheppaschlucht</a>" was wide-angle territory, this year's Urban Dreams are dreamt with long lenses, and it seems the longer the better.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_073939_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_073939_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> The current fair weather is very helpful with that. The problem is, that at those focal lengths you need quite a high shutter speed, even if you happen to have VR. In fact, without VR this lens would be perfectly useless on the streets.<br/><br/>That is the main reason, why I rarely use the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_145433_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_145433_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> It is big and heavy, heavier than the Nikon 70-300 VR, and it is extremely hard to hold. I have even bought me a monopod for this lens. The funny thing is, that I have the lens in Carinthia and the monopod here in Vienna. Oh well!<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090508_145913_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090508_145913_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> These images are from Friday. 13 posted here, one or two would have made it, were it not for my laziness ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I didn't exactly manage to catch up this weekend, but it is not as bad as it seems. I have only one image each for Saturday and Sunday, and given that I am already in a hurry for work, I may not pile up as much today.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is of course "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/john_lennon/imagine.html">Imagine</a>" by John Lennon. I have it on the collection "Shaved Fish". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxLnIRVVwIM">YouTube</a>.
