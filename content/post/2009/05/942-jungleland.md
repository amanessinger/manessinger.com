It's Friday afternoon, I'm on the train from Vienna to Carinthia, and this is the post for Tuesday.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090512_065824_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090512_065824_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Tuesday was really the day when the weather began to deteriorate. Most of the week we had rain at least in the morning. This will certainly show in the number of usable images. Not that I'm concerned, I should have enough material for my <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> effort by now, it does not really affect me, but it's still annoying.<br/><br/>The first image was taken on the tram. Raindrops and smeared bird droppings on a window. Oh well. It's still a nice composition in a way ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090512_070515_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090512_070515_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> Confronted with rain, I normally go into color seeking mode. In a shop window in JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe I found these funny guys. They would do nicely anyway, so the text "I dream about you" is a bonus. Apart from that, the right one really looks positively kissable ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090512_070656_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090512_070656_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> Btw, you may have noticed that I have changed the blog's layout slightly. There is a blogroll again. You have to scroll a little bit down, it's under the blog archive. It uses the standard blogger widget for blog lists. <br/><br/>This time it mirrors quite accurately what I read (or rather not at the moment), because I have imported my subscriptions from Google Reader. All in all over 120 blogs and news feeds. Don't worry if you don't find your's, the widget shows only the 25 most recent posts, but you can get the whole list by clicking "Show All" at the bottom of the list.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090512_155815_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090512_155815_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> I hope this removes all complaints. The manual list that I had before, was hopelessly outdated, and there was simply no way to make a fair ranking. Now it's easy: the more often you post on your own blog, the more often you are in the top part ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090512_154947_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090512_154947_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> On a side note: I know that some Bloggers are "following" my blog, and so far I have not followed anybody. It's all a matter of volume and maintainance cost. As soon as you have more than a hundred links, everything gets tedious. <br/><br/>But really: does anybody have experience with the benefits of following or being followed? Is the effect different from linking and being linked to? Do I miss something?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2009/20090512_160027_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2009/20090512_160027_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left;"/></a> The other thing is, that I have made the layout a fixed width again, and on wider screens it is centered. This makes my embedded thumbnails a bit less prone to shift around when the paragraphs in between are too short.<br/><br/>It now looks nice on everything from a width of 1024 pixels up. It may be a problem on net books though, but I suspect they will have had a problem in the past as well.<br/><br/> Still, I'm interested in your feedback to these changes.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/jungleland.html" target="_blank">Jungleland</a>" from the 1975 Bruce Springsteen album "Born To Run".
