If you already saw today's "<a href="/2009/05/947-lonesome-road.html">947 - Lonesome Road</a>", and were appalled by the garish colors, rest assured, so was I when I first saw them on a real monitor here in Vienna.<br/><br/>Sometimes this happens when you edit on a laptop with a bad display. Normally I can compensate for the display's faults by looking at color numbers, that's especially true for setting white points, but sometimes everything fails and the image falls apart. I have just replaced the Image of the Day with a more moderate version. Thus, please give it one more chance, it's not as bad as you thought ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Good night.
