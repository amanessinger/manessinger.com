I'm pretty sure it's not the first time that I've taken this
image. Every time, twice a year when I bring the car for
changing tires, I end up with 40 minutes in a pretty dull
part of Villach, walking around and spotting picture-worthy
things.

But even if, at least this is one of the better ones in
terms of lines meeting corners. It's an obsession of mine,
like children trying to not step across tiles. You know,
three are easy. Four are not. You can easily fake it in
Photoshop with "Edit / Transform / Skew" (which I sometimes
do), but in-camera it takes some fiddling :satisfied:
