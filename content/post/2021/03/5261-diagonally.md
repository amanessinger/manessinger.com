I use a Macbook Air now. One of those new Apple Silicon
notebooks. Maxed out at only 16 GB, but with 2 TB of SSD.
It's fast, and it gives complete peace of mind. Total
silence, more power than my six-year-old Macbook Pro had. I
don't have all my images on it, but at least the years 2006,
2007, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

2018 is what I still post, 2019 is what I sometimes work on,
2021 is the current catalog. The rest is for the times when
I'm not busy, i.e. never :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

It's fine to have also enough space for all my music, bought
as downloads or ripped from my CDs.
