Neusiedl is a townlet at the northern end of Neusiedlersee,
one of Europe's only two endorheic lakes, the other being
Lake Balaton in Hungary,

Neusiedlersee is a border lake between Austria and Hungary,
extending north to south. On the Austrian side it is in
Burgenland, a small province, that, until the end of World
War I, was part of Hungary. It was the most German of the
bilingual parts of Hungary. 

Neusiedl was just on the way along the lake, high fog was
making the light even and bland, so I didn't even try to
find any more photo opportunities. In the hope for clear sky
later, I drove on along the lake.
