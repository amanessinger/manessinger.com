This is the third rarely used lens. I only use it along with
the Panasonic 12-32G/3.5-5.6 and the Olympus 9-18/4.0. It's
the Olympus 40-150/4.0-5.6, an ultra-light long zoom with a
plastic mount. I bought it used, it was ultra-cheap and ...
it's fine. Much better than hauling around the big
40-150/2.8.
