And another underused lens. This is the _Sigma 56mm F1.4 DC
DN | Contemporary_. What a name. I thought I needed it, I
found it to be pretty good, but somehow it never grew dear
to me. There isn't much difference to the Olympus 75/1.8,
only that the Olympus, as an object, is much more beautiful,
especially in silver, as I like my primes :grin:
