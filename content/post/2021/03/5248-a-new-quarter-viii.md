A few days ago I had my 57<sup>th</sup> birthday. Not
exactly a reason to cheer, but not a reason to get depressed
either. If we'd only be already rid of that Covid thing. I
can't tell you how I hate it. It's almost a year now, that
Austria went into its first lockdown, more than a year that
everybody but Trump began to worry :stuck_out_tongue:
