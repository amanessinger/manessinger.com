If in Burgenland a village is called "am See" ("at the
lake"), it means nothing. In most places, with a few
exceptions, you won't see the shore. Neusiedlersee is
surrounded by a reed zone up to 1 km in width. The whole
lake is no deeper than around 2 meters.

You reach the water in a few places through artificial
channels, that are regularly kept free of reeds and mud, or
via causeways built into the lake. Technically, you may have
a house on the shore, but practically what you have is
nothing but the gnats :smile:
