Slowly things are getting normal here. Last weekend I was
for three days in Styria. Nice hotel in a small town between
rolling hills and low mountains, a church on a mountaintop,
two monasteries. Unfortunately it's still more than a year
to go, until you see the pictures here.

The point is, it is possible again to go on vacations. You
need to wear masks in hotels and restaurants, unless seated,
and you need to show you're either vaccinated, recovered or
freshly tested, but it definitely feels like progress.
