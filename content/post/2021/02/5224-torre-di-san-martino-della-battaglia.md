This tower is a monument to a battle. It was one of the
multiple catastrophically lost battles in the history of the
late Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a result, Austria lost most
of what it possessed in northern Italy. Trieste remained
Austrian, but Venice (only acquired after the Napoleonic
Wars) was lost.

The battle was called after a small village nearby, and is
known as the [Battle of
Solferino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino).
It was such a carnage, that it caused the founding of the
Red Cross and the Geneva Convention.
