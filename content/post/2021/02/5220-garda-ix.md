This is quite some dynamic range. It's not the 15 bit dynamic 
range of the new Sony Alpha 1 (or what it is called), but it 
is not bad. The camera recorded sufficient detail in the bright 
background, and it also did so in the shadows. Could it be 
better? Quite possible. Would I be able to spot the difference? 
Certainly, given enough attention to detail. Do I care? 

Nope :smiley:

In this case as well, as in that of the bright spot on the 
altar a few days ago, the camera recorded more than I could 
see. In both cases the problem was not a lack of tonal range, 
in both cases it was the problem of how to distribute the range 
in what a monitor can represent.

It will be interesting to see what future HDR monitors can do,
and by this I don't mean 50% more dynamic range. I mean 10 times
or a hundred times more dynamic range. In reality, what I have 
depicted here, is far out of gamut for every existing device.

On the other hand: who will want to be blinded by their 
computer monitor?
