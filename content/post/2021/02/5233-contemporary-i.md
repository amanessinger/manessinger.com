We'll spend some time near the recently renovated Vienna
Main Station. A vast area there had belonged to the Austrian
Federal Railways, and seemingly they don't need it any more.
The new station is the Central Station now, and it has made
almost all other of Vienna's railway stations obsolete. The
result is a sprawl of new office and residential buildings
of varying architectural quality.
