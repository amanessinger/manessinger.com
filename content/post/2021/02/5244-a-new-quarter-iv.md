These apartment buildings are in the most silent place, far
from busy streets, immediately next to Prater forest. They
are moderately high and a unique, rare resource. There are
five towers of different hight. Of course one would want to
live on top of the highest, but that's insanely expensive,
at least for Vienna. Californians might shrug it off :smile:
