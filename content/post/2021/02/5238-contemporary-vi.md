Has Architecture ever been better? The blog post I
mentioned, bemoaned how the great architecture of the early
20<sup>th</sup> century had been torn down and replaced with
... this.

To make the point, they showed a few images from a hundred
years ago. You see a very broad boulevard with trees,
tramways and some cars. The houses are smaller, in the
typical style of the time, and they seem to have shops and
restaurants. A few people are on the street. Everything
looks populated and in use.

The difference in architectural style is not the problem.
High-rise glass buildings can be ok. What really has changed
is the purpose of being there. The broad boulevard of then
has become a river of cars. There are no caf√©s and no
restaurants, no trees and no free space. It's a place where
you go when you must, and there is no reason to stay any
longer than you need to.
