Do you change lenses all the time? I don't. Sure, in a given
situation, there is probably a lens better suited to the job
than the one on your camera. If you have a zoom, no problem,
if not, you change to a different prime in your bag.

Only I rarely do. I find it very calming and inspiring to
stick to a lens and try to see the world through _its_
perspective.

Until I do, of course. Here I did.
