Another pavilion. This time I went black and white, because
the sun in that corner caused purplish flares, and due to
the immense contrast, I had to apply extreme corrections to
the shadows. It's hard to do that while keeping color
intact, and it's stupid to even try, when there are no
pleasing colors to begin with :grin:
