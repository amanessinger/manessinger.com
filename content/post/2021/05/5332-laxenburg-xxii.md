This image was taken with the Sigma 56/1.4 wide open. In
terms of field of view and depth of field this is equivalent
to 112/2.8 on "Full Frame", but in terms of light falling on
the sensor, it is still f1.4. Same image, only a full stop
faster. 

Could I get f1.4 at 112 mm on "Full Frame"? Well, Sigma has
a 105/1.4 for USD 1599. It weighs 1.65 kg. Guess I'm too old
for that :grin:
