Micro Four Thirds might die. Olympus has quit. OMD (or how
they are called), the company that has bought their camera
business, has not brought out a substantial product yet, and
a few days ago I read that Panasonic's camera business does
not spectacularly well either.

What would I do? At the moment, I see no substantial
advantage in switching to the once small film format that is
called "Full Frame". Yes, shallow depth of field is easier to
achieve, but I can have that with my 25/0.95 as well. On the
other hand, a picture like this is hard to get in "Full
Frame".

This image works for me because of the surreal effect of the
filigree of twigs in the foreground being just as well in
focus as the remote background with the castle. The tree
frames and decorates the castle, becomes part of a tapestry.
This is f10, hand-held on a sunny day, but I could pull it
off at dawn as well.

APS-C? No, thanks, I've been there. A lot of cheap lenses,
and if you want good quality, you're forced into "Full
Frame" lenses, their size and their weight.

Smart phones? Well, I use them for purely documentary photos
all the time, but for what I consider my art or just my
precious memories? Nope. Doesn't work for me.

Mind though, Micro Four Thirds is not dead yet. I might get
another OMD or two, maybe even with a higher resolution
sensor. Sony is said to have one. Thus, for the time being
and while cameras and lenses work and are in supply, I'll
stick to what I have. I might even add some lenses, for
instance the marvellous Olympus f1.2 primes.

What I know for sure is, that I have no desire at all to go
for big and heavy again.
