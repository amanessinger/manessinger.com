It's not exactly a crisis what we experience in Austria
right now, but the carefully constructed, shiny image of our
youthful chancellor Sebastian Kurz got a lot of stains
lately.

He and his followers have shown an infuriating contempt for
parliamentary rules and the truth in general. Mistakes were
made, everyone else was blamed, lies were spread and there
is a lot of behavior, that looks outright corrupt and
sometimes criminal. Not enough hard evidence is on the
table, but the similarity to the Hungarian regimé of Victor
Orbán is striking. The government tries to control economy,
media and public opinion, attacks independent journalists
and the Justice Department.

Basically this is the same strategy so-called "conservative"
parties apply all over the world. Attack the institutions,
treat them as yours, give back to your donors in laws that
serve them, hand out key jobs to your blind followers.
Destroy reality, make people doubt the system, let them be
ruled by the fear you spread.
