Still Laxenburg, two years ago. 

Today I made my first day trip to Italy since September. I
already have a full vaccination, but Italy currently
requires tests. No problem, I got a test yesterday. Then I
had to fill out a form and print it, fill out another form
online, and that was it.

Entrance to Italy was as always. Just driving across the
border at 100 kilometers per hour. Nobody in Italy asked for
anything, no checks, no nothing. 

As I've already noticed in September, people are extremely
responsible with masks, and in Italy you wear them outside
as well. Restaurants are open outside. It was an extremely
clear and sunny day, and I enjoyed eating in Grado while
seeing across the sea the italian city of Trieste, and
directly to the south, the northern shore of Istria, the
peninsula shared by Slovenia and Croatia. I could never see
any of them from Grado. It was a surreal feeling of being on
a lake shore, more like Lake Garda than the Adriatic Sea.

When entering Austria, we were checked for passport and
health status. Proof of vaccination or recent negative test
are enough. No forms.
