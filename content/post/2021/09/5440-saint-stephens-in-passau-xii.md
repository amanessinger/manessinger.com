It is August 31 while I write this post. We'll go to Italy on September 2, 
and when you read this post, we'll just have returned the night before. 
Piacenza this time. A small city south of Milano, west of Parma, east of 
Alessandria, on the north side of the Apennine Mountains. The images I will
have taken there, shall arrive at this blog sometime in late 2022 or early 2023.
