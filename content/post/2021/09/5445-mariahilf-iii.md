Remember those covered stairs leading up to the church? 
Well, now we are looking down. You see that kind of stairs 
quite often in the alpine region, but not only. The italian 
city of Bologna is famous for the longest covered walkway,
[leading up to San Luca](https://bolognauncovered.com/2019/01/18/walking-in-bologna-the-portico-and-the-sanctuary-of-san-luca/).
