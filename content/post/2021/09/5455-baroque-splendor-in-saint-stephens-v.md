Fashion-conscious saints in rich, flowing garments. It would be
interesting to see what the wife of a carpenter in old
Galilee really wore.

Where did those baroque artists get their inspiration? I
suppose, to a large part it was fantasy, based on old,
roman, and especially byzantine imagery. Images of
aristocracy, images depicting imperial weddings. Certainly
not what poor people wore.
