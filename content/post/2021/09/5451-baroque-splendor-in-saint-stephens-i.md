Would it be better there were no pyramids? No greek temples and 
christian churches? Objectively ... maybe. Millions and billions 
of people could have been fed with all those resources. And then, 
maybe not. Maybe it is human nature to bring immense resources 
to waste in war, to use them for grand artistic efforts ... 
or not to use them at all.
