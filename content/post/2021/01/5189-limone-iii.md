Last October I forgot to mention the birthday of this blog. It's
well in its fifteenth year now, and as always, one post per day, one
Image of the Day :smiley:

It's silent here and I write largely into the void. Since the last
iteration of the build system, the blog is completely static. No
database, no tracking, no visitor counters, no nothing. You can
comment, I get the comments by mail, and if you leave an email
address, I get that as well. If not, I don't. To most comments I
reply, but it's clear that this effort is moot. You don't get
automatic notifications of answers to your comments and there is no
comment feed that you could subscribe to.

Why? I don't have to worry about GDPR compliance, you don't have to
endure adverts and neither do I sell you anything, no do I sell your
data to anybody. Solitary peace of mind.

You're welcome!
