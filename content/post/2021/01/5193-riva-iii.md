The castle from the other side. I haven't been in. That's the
problem with the long day trip around the lake: you have to hurry.
That day we found it more important to eat a plate of Canederli con
burro, salvia e parmigiano, a local favorite. They are small
dumplings with sage, butter and grated cheese. Delicious!
