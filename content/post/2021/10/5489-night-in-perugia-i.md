So it's Italy again. Perugia is a university city and the
capital of the province of Umbria. This is the restaurant
where we ate the first night, right around the corner of the
hotel we'd have liked to stay in. Unfortunately we booked
late. What we got was a mixed blessing: outside the center,
near a highway, but easy to get out of town, and with a nice
swimming pool thrown in. Not the worst of choices.
