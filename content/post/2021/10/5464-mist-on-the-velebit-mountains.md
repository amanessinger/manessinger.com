This image was taken from a distance. There was enough mist
to take contrast and saturation out of even the foreground.
I've tried to give the impression of being closer to the
subject, but without giving up on depth. I've tried a
lighter version, but actually it didn't improve. I like the
dark mood, even though it certainly didn't look like that
:smiley:
