The northern Adriatic on its Croatian side is much like a
big lake. There's always another island not far away. Rab is
located between the coast and the islands of Cres/Losinj
and, in the south, the long island of Pag. I think, what we
see here in the far middleground, is the low, dark island of Cres, and behind it the
mountains of the Istrian peninsula.
