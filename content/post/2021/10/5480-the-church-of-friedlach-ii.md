As soon as I get out of Carinthia, it gets even worse. Last
Saturday I was in Treviso. I suppose you'll see the pictures
in two and a half years, but let me tell you: It's only less
than three hours by car from where I live. A town of 70.000,
a marvel, one of the most lovely cities in Italy, really,
but I'd never been there. Too big a world :smile:
