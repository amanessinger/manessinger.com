They fly two flags on this square in front of Saint Stephens.
One is yellow and white, that's the flag of the pope. The 
other one, in blue and white, is obviously the flag of the 
Bishop of Passau. That blue and white are also the colors 
of Bavaria's chequered flag (like the sky, they say), is 
certainly no coincidence.
