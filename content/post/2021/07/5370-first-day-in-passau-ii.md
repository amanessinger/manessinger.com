We're still stuck in yesterday's tunnel :smiley:

We stayed in a nice hotel in Passau's historic center. This
tunnel is right around the corner, below our first church. A
tunnel below a church, you ask? Couldn't they have built the
street around?

Well, the center is on a peninsula, originally a narrow
strip of rock at the confluence of rivers Danube and Inn.
Space was precious there.
