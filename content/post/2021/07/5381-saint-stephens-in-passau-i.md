So, this is the big one. If there were nothing else in
Passau, this would have been the reason to come. Of course
the church is full of tourists whenever no mass is
celebrated, but that's what it is today. I think tourism in
Passau is not very seasonal, so you just have to accept it,
and there is no way around. At least taking pictures was
possible.
