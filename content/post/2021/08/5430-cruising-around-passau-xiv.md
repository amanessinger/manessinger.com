And finally the spectacular one. I missed it when we first 
crossed over the line, where the waters of the two rivers meet, 
but on the way back I took attention. The light, muddy water is 
from river Inn. It comes from out of the Alps, seemingly after
rainlfall. The clear, dark water, that's river Danube.
