Is this a bad image? Well, yes. Why do I bother you? This is a 
fountain in the courtyard in the complex of Saint Stephens, 
the former cloister, and I'll show you a few images of details 
next. This image can give you a vague notion of context, 
and at the same time, it allows me to remember the place.

It turns out, these images are not only the archive of my 
creativity, they are also my long-term memory. I tend to forget
what I've not taken images of, but I also forget the images that
I've not processed :smile:
