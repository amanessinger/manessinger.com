Isn't that a beautiful city? Well, the problem is high 
water. Every few years it happens. Inn is the main culprit.
The northern side of the Alps is, where all the clouds coming
in from the Atlantic burst. All the water collects in the 
rivers running north. Basically all the water from Tyrol and 
much from notoriously rainy Salzburg joins the Inn, and then 
it runs through Passau.
