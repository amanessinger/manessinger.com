A series of the following pictures, this one included,
were taken from a cruise ship. In fact, the whole cruise 
takes less than an hour. Sounds crazy? Yup, but you'll
see, that it gives a great view on parts of the city, that 
you'd otherwise never see. 

This is the fortress. It is on the left side of river Danube,
pretty high on a hill. We'll look down from it in ... little 
more than a month :grin:
