Do I remember all these images? No. A few yes, the bulk
categorically no. I tend to remember the places, the
stories, but not the individual churches. 

Take this image: It's obviously one of mine, no doubt, but I
can't remember having processed it. From the image alone, I
would have no idea where this could be.
