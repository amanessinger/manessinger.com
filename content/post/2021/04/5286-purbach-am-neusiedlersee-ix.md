Like many wine-growing communities in eastern Austria,
Purbach has something we call "Kellergasse" ("Cellar Row").

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2019/20190407_113343_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2019/20190407_113343_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In most cases this is a long 
strip with two roads along a center canal or small creek,
flanked by wine cellars built into the ground. Here the
cellars are covered with earth an grass, only the chimneys
peeking out.

They are tourist attractions. Frequently you can taste wine
"fresh from the cellar", and some of them offer food as
well. You better stay overnight though, because wine and
driving are not a good match :smiley:
