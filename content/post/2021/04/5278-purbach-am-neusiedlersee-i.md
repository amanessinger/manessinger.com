Purbach am Neusiedlersee is one of the bigger communes along
the lake. I parked the car in this street outside the old
center. 

On the western side, there is no wall. Instead, the
backsides of houses are connected, giving a wall-like
feeling. I suppose, there must have been a wall originally,
but most walls were torn down during the Napoleonic Wars,
when Austria was de-militarized by the French occupation.
