Of course I had to go in. Nice ceiling, indeed.

For images like this, I definitely prefer wider lenses than
the Olympus 9-18/4.0-5.6, but it is a great lens for going
light.

7.5/2](https://www.venuslens.net/product/laowa-7-5mm-f2/)
rectilinear lens. It's wider, but has a fixed focal length.
Quality is great, and if you think it must be big and heavy,
you're wrong. 

I have bought the "lightweight" version,
weighing in at only 150g. You won't see my pictures with it
before at least another year though.

Doesn't it look gorgeous on my silver PEN-F? :smile:
