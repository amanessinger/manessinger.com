A fresco from some roof or above some side altar. I can't
remember.

In general, I don't plan visits to churches. I know I missed
a few details important to art history. What you see is what
I saw, without prior knowledge. OK, that's probably stupid,
but that happens when I'm immersed in photography. In the
future, I'll try my best to get myself informed beforehand
:grin:
