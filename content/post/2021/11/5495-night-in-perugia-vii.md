Piazza IV Novembre, with Palazzo dei Priori in the
background. 

This square is something of a wound in my side. There's a
famous fountain on that square, and I don't have a single
image of it. On the other side of the fountain is the
Cathedral. 

That first night I decided to take images of the fountain at
daylight, when I visit the Cathedral. Which I tried, two
times. There were always services, and you can't disturb a
service by prancing around and taking pictures. In the end I
got no images of the church and none of the fountain :smile:
