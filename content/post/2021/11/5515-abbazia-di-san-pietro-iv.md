I've tried that shot a few times, always holding a series of
five images, one stop apart. None of these series were
perfect, this is the best. The center is fine, don't look
near the borders. The merged image shows an EXIF value of
1/50s, but the longest exposure took 1.3s. This is nothing
that shouldn't be possible with the OMD E-M1 II, but it
already stresses stabilization. Wouldn't have been a problem
with the OMD E-M1 III, but I only bought that half a year
later.
