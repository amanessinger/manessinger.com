This church consumed a lot of my time. We saw it from the
road back from Gubbio. I knew it was on the right side. The
image has a timestamp, but I know the camera's clock has
been off by _some amount_.

In the end, I drove the whole road from Gubbio to Perugia
_twice_ on Google Street View. It didn't find it. One day
later, I searched the most likely area in Google Maps'
satellite view. That's how I finally found it. Then I tried
Street View again. Yes, now I found the crossing, but with
the wide-angle perspective, it was all too easy to miss.

To add insult to injury: when we were there, the church was
closed :smiley:
