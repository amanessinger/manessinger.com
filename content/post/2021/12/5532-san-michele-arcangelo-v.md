Funny. I told you about another round church in Rome, that
was built at around 300 AD, and that this one was younger
but still pretty old. Well, I never bothered looking it up
in Wikipedia. Doing so, revealed that the basic circular
structure was finished in the 6<sup>th</sup> century. Only 1400
years :smile:
