On our way from Perugia to Gubbio, we passed the Abbazia
Montelabate. It's a little off the road and ... it was not
open for visits. I learned later from Wikipedia and Google
Street View, that the monastery is in pretty bad repair. I
don't know if there are plans for re-opening. Use as an
actual monastery is out of the question, and for a tourist
attraction, it might be too far off, to make restoration a
commercially viable endeavour.
