New Years Eve, one year past. And what a year it was! Covid
was with us, always learning new tricks. Omicron is the
latest, and at least chances are, that this will be the end
of the pandemic as a life-threatening situation. For better
or for worth, it might become unavoidable, regardless of
vaccination.

We've got our booster in mid-November. I feel no fear.
Actually, I never did. I think, Covid 19 was at all times
more of a statistic problem. Most people have no feeling for
big numbers. Most people think, that a chance of one in a
hundred (to say something), of ending up in intensive care,
is a good chance. Individually, it's something most people
would risk.

Unfortunately, in a country like Austria, that would mean
90.000 people in ICUs. One in a thousand? 9.000 people in
ICUs. How many do we have? Approximately 2000. Two thirds of
them are occupied at any time, needed for non-Covid
patients. People coming in from car accidents, people
recovering from life-saving transplantations, strokes,
whatever. 700 Covid patients in ICUs are considered critical
in Austria. In many other countries, the ratio of ICUs to
population count is worse.

OK, you can spend the money, buy the beds (although you
wouldn't get them in time these days), buy the ventilators,
but intensive care means well-educated, experienced,
motivated personnel. You certainly can't get that, even less
so after all that meat-grinding stress, that happened during
the pandemic.

That's the reason why we need to show solidarity, and get
our vaccines. Not because we feel individually, that we need
them. The reason is, that the system breaks down, long
before it gets scary for us personally.
