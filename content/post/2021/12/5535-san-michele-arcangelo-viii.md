For the baptistery, I had to use HDR and extreme color
correction. The sun fell right through the window, and the
color of the glass was yellow. The result looks fine and
natural. In reality, everything had a beautiful, golden
tint. It only didn't translate to the image. Sometimes image
processing is weirdly subjective :grin:
