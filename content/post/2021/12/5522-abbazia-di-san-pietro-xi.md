Already December 2021! What a year, and how naive we were
last year! I had my third BioNTech shot two weeks ago, but
with the ominous Omicron variant, the next might be not too
far away. 

This is the second of the three cloisters in San Pietro. The
monastery complex is part of Perugia's university, and the
third cloister was full of students spending their noon
break there. I didn't take any pictures of it, but in
appearance, it was very close to this one.
