Not so far this time. Here you can see that the building is neither circle nor ellipsis. It is rectangular on the north-eastern side and rounded in the south-west. We look at it from south-east. As far as I remember, the lake is artifical, but - unlike the last one - it had already existed when the Nazis began their work.
