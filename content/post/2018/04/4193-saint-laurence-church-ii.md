Do you ever re-process your images? I never thought I would, but it turns out I currentyl do so with images from 2006.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20170618_203914_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20170618_203914_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It began with an effort to re-catalog my old images in Lightroom, but when I looked at what I'd done to those images twelve years ago, I decided to re-process a few of them. Then there were more and ... I may never come to and end. 

A few days ago Adobe released another update to Lightroom CC Classic, and it brought a new profile system. Initially I found it irritating, but after a while and some playing around, I found that I liked it a lot. 

Of course this is not a dramatic difference, but when I compare the Photoshop RAW process of 2006 with what we have in Lightroom now, the difference is nothing but spectacular indeed. Sometimes I find it breathtaking how mallable these old images are with our new tools.
