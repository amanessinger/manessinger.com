<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20170619_131741-Pano_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20170619_131741-Pano_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> You probably have seen Zeppelin Field in Leni Riefenstahl's "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will">Triumph of the Will</a>".
