This is an image that you can't "just take". I've made it in Lightroom. I had to change a lot here. 

First comes the perspective. Of course I could not look straight towards the bridge. I've corrected the perspective in order to get a perfect rectangle.

The water of the river is greenish dark. Therefore the reflection lacks brightness and contrast, and it also has a strong cast. All three effects are stronger where you look at the water at a steeper angle. Evening it out took me a few gradients, but now the image has exactly the look that I wanted to achieve: the look of a fairy tale illustration in the books of my childhood.
