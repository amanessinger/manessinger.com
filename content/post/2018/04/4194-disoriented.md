The southern half of Nuremberg's historic center must have been hit harder by the bombs. Fewer historic buildings have been reconstructed after the war, many streets lack a characteristic Nurembergian style, much looks like everywhere else in Germany. This may be due to the fact that the railway station is situated just south of the center.
