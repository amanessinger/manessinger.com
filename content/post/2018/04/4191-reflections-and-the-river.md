Nuremberg lies on a river called Pegnitz and on the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal. If you ever ever take a river cruise from the Netherlands down to Hungary (like my friend <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a> did last summer), you'll pass through Nuremberg.

Nuremberg has lots of nice places along the river and quite a few bridges. Like in Paris, London or Budpest (and contrary to Vienna) the river runs right through the city's historic center.
