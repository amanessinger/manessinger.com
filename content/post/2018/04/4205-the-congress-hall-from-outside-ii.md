For me there has always been a certain fascination in seeing Nazi architecture. Of course in many ways it is just copying the style of the Roman Empire - like every empire has done since. The Roman style has become symbol for and architectural expression of imperial power.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20170619_114745_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20170619_114745_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the other hand, Nazi architecture (like its fascist Italian counterpart) is heavily influenced by a brutal, modernist fashion. In a way the Nazis built in stone what they brandished as "degenerate art" in paintings and burned as books.
