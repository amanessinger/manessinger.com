The Congress Hall was never finished. Hardly anything in Nuremberg's "Reichsparteitagsgel√§nde" was.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20170619_114231_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20170619_114231_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The architect, Albert Speer, had the vision of a kind of grandeur that had not been built in centuries. It was meant to symbolize the Thousand Year Reich.

The City of Nuremberg has tried a few things to come to grips with this unwelcome legacy. First they tried to tear everything down, but after the war and in a time when people so much more needed to rebuild their heavily bombed city, demolition was not practical. 

Today the Congress Hall houses a museum, the rest of the buildings is left to slow decay. The vast areas in between are intermittently used as fairgrounds or just as parks.
