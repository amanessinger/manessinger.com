An old friend of mine, basically the only one in our group who has made a big career, currently lives in Berlin. We've missed visiting him in Lausanne, we've missed his years in Ireland, and now we wanted to finally see him in Berlin.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20170618_181023_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20170618_181023_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Of course you can take a plane and be in Berlin in no time, but that's not what we normally do when being on vacation. Normally we like to travel by car and be independent.

Berlin, that's about 800&nbsp;km from Villach. Of course you can drive that in a day (and we did so on our way back), but we didn't want to hurry. 

To make it short: Nuremberg is about in the middle, and visiting it on our way sounded like a good idea.
