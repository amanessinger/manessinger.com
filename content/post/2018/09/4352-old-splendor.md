This beautiful old house is right at the end of Srednja ulica, the
street starting at the main square with that statue of a bishop. The
house looks like there was more money than space in the narrow
quarter. Today it still shows neglect, but I don't doubt that it
will renovated soon, ending up as an expensive boutique hotel or
something like that.

It seems to be the fate of beautiful places to become tourist-only
areas. I just returned from Lago di Garda, near Verona in northern
Italy. It's a beautiful lake and it seems to have largely avoided
that kind touristic ossification - in all but its most spectacular
spot: Limone. I love the place for its long gone possibilities, but
I hate it for its final reality. You'll see a few pictures of it,
but at the current rate it won't be earlier than in about a year
