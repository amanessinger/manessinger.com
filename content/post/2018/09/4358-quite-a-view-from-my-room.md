A few days ago, after I had finally parted completely with
WordPress, I said I had re-created some feed URLs modeled after the
way Blogger works. Well, I'm glad to see that it worked! My
feedburner stats are back to where they were.

I'm afraid this gets technical, but it is really important for any
blogger changing systems. Let me explain:

[Feedburner](https://feedburner.google.com/) is a popular system for
blogging support. Its premise is, that you redirect your own
site's feed to feedburner, and that people subscribing to your feed
in reality subscribe to the feed re-published by feedburner.

Should you ever change sites, you'd just go to the feedburner
dashboard and change the URL of the source feed (your site) to the
new site's feed. No change for the subscribers would be needed.

Additionally feedburner did some cosmetic changes to the feed, to
make it palatable for the broadest selection of reader software
possible. You can even read the blog with a browser directly through
the feed.

The problem arises, when you've not started with feedburner. Some
people will have subscribed to my original blogger blog, then under
the url
[http://photography-andreas-manessinger.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default](http://photography-andreas-manessinger.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default).
I don't know when I added feedburner, but it was definitely later.

What happens now is this: Your reader has subscribed to
[http://photography-andreas-manessinger.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default](http://photography-andreas-manessinger.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default),
and every time the reader accesses this feed, Blogger tells it that
it should instead go to
[http://feeds.feedburner.com/photography-andreas-manessinger](http://feeds.feedburner.com/photography-andreas-manessinger).
Your reader does so, you see the content and everything works.

A while later I introduced a custom domain for my Blogger blog, and
my feed changed to
[http://photography.andreas-manessinger.info/feeds/posts/default](http://photography.andreas-manessinger.info/feeds/posts/default).
Again some people subscribed, again the redirect to feedburner was
active.

When I went away from Blogger and to my self-hosted WordPress, I was
very careful to recreate all URLs that had ever been active.

Not so this time. Without much thinking (and with all the
information to know better), I had assumed that after so many years
every subscriber would be subscribed to the feedburner URL, but
that's simply not true. Some reader programs may indeed update the
feed URL of a subscription due to a permanent redirect, but I
suppose most simply follow the redirect every time.

That means, most of my early readers still always go to
[http://photography-andreas-manessinger.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default](http://photography-andreas-manessinger.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default).
It works, because my Blogger blog is still there, it just redirects
to [manessinger.com](https://manessinger.com). If Google ever
terminates Blogger (Why should they? Otoh, they did terminate Google
Reader, didn't they?), I will lose some of my readers, even though I
have not blogged on Blogger for many years. Scary!

People who subscribed after the introduction of the custom domain
still go to
[http://photography.andreas-manessinger.info/feeds/posts/default](http://photography.andreas-manessinger.info/feeds/posts/default),
and that's what I failed to provide.

What's the take-away? Feedburner helps a lot less than I thought it
would. You are still condemned to provide any URL that you've ever
used.
