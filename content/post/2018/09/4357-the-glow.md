I suppose reality might have looked slightly less beautiful. I'm
positively certain this is true for the in-camera JPEG
:stuck_out_tongue:

This image at ISO 400 was treated with DxO. The result underwent a
few local adjustments in Lightroom. I love that image. It's
currently the background image on my iPad.

Apropos iPad: I've had a problem lately that really was a PITA. On
the iPad I normally use Gboard, a keyboard replacement by Google.
Due to security reasons, iOS switches back to the default keyboard
by Apple, as soon as you need to enter a password. Now, whenever
that happened, the Apple keyboard showed no proper key symbols at
all. Instead every key showed only a question mark. Try to use that
to enter a long password :rage:

Obviously a font problem introduced by an upgrade, I thought. In my
despair I uninstalled Gboard. Didn't help.

Hmm ... if you have one of those bad, not-so-cheap so-called
operating systems like Windows, what do you do reflexively whenever
you have a problem? Reboot! Right. That's what I finally did. Guess
what? It fixed the problem. C'mon, Apple, you always said you can do
better!
