And by "dark" I mean really, really, really dark. 

That's what I always say: for me the problem of image quality is
solved. I'm no action shooter, my altars don't move. This image has
been taken wide open at f2.0 and 0.4s. Handheld. Perfectly
stabilized. At ISO 200. There's nothing I could wish for.
