Less than three weeks to go, then my current hosting account for 
the blog will expire. No need to worry though. The new blog is 
almost done. Commenting has mostly been implemented, there's just 
one last component missing. I expect to make the switch within 
about a week.

The image? Well, I love looking at the sea. It's similar to how I
loved to look at the clouds when I was a child. Clouds, waves, 
they both look like ever changing landscapes where your fantasy can
roam endlessly.
