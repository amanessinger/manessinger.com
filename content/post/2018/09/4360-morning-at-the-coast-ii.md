Early morning is a wonderful time for strolling in tourist areas.
Nobody's around, and as a bonus you get some first-class light.

Actually, although I'd call myself an introvert, I don't mind
people. What I frequently do mind, that is their clothing. 

In recent years there has been an increase of garish marker colors
(yellow, orange and pink mostly) as T shirt colors. That may be
great for bicyclists and helps them getting seen in traffic, but the
problem for photographers is, that those colors never fit into any
image. A few months ago I was in a church and waited for a man in a
brightly orange shirt to walk away from the center axis. He did, and
while he was in a position where he didn't obstruct the main
subject, he didn't move any further. 

I ended up completely desaturating his shirt :smiley:
