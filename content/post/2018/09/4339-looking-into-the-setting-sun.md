Welcome to the other side! Glad to see you :sweat_smile:

From now on I am deliberately handicapped when it comes to judging
how many readers I have. I still see stats in
[feedburner](https://feedburner.google.com/) (that's a Google
service that I've used since 2006 to give my RSS feed a constant,
never-changing address), but other than that, there is no Google
Analytics, no StatCounter nor anything else. In other words: I can't
track you.

It's not that I couldn't do it on a static blog. Everybody does.
It's only that I think I don't need that any more. I've done it for
a long time and I've learned that I cannot increase my readership
without investing a lot of time. And even then, there is an upper
limit, that I can't break with my type of content. In its best times
the blog had about 500 readers per day, on good days a few
thousands. 90% of them came for a handful of posts.

I had one of the first "user experience reviews" of the Nikon D300
online, and for one lens, the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC, I had the only
review for a long time. I did some comparisons between DxO versions, I
produced some Photoshop tutorials, and that drew most of the
traffic.

If you've done that for a few years, it stops having appeal. It is
just work. As I always say, thanks, I have a job :smiley:

I've also stopped having ads on the blog. I used to have amazon ads,
mainly as a means to link to music, but I've removed them as well.
They didn't earn me money anyway, and nowadays they would make the
blog count as "commercial" - with all the implications this has in
times of the
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).


Therefore: if you like what you see, and if you want to do me a
favor: drop me a comment :grinning:
