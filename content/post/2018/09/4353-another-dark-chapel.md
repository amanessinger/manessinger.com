Rab, the town, as picturesque as it is, has not so many sights to
show off. What's there, can easily be seen in a single visit. I've
been there a few times now, and I am sure this is a chapel that I've
already shown a few years ago. Let's see ...

Nope, I've just checked, it seems this is a first. You've seen the
church from outside, but for some reason I have at least not used
any interior image on the blog. Well, after almost 12 years it gets
harder and harder not to repeat yourself :stuck_out_tongue:
