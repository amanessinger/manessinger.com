Regardless of how long vacations are (and most of mine are short),
there's inevitably the point when it's over. While you were there,
you've enjoyed it, and although you knew the point would come, you
felt an experience so rich, that you couldn't help but expect it
to last.

And that's life. Better savor it, better enjoy it while you can. It
would be a sad moment to stand there and look back to nothing.
