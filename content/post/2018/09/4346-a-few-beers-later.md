I'm pretty sure I've lost a few people. I'm not sure how, but it
very much looks like it. Feedburner shows me a significant drop in
subscribers.

Hmm ... Maybe some people use very, very old URLs. If so, well,
remember, I've announced that I'd tell you how to fix that RSS feed
- if you only come to https://manessinger.com. If you happen to have
a problem with the feed that you've subscribed to, here's the thing:
just unsubscribe, and then subscribe to
https://blog.andreas-manessinger.info/index.xml or https://manessinger.com/index.xml

That's it. Both are completely under my control, both will exist
forever.
