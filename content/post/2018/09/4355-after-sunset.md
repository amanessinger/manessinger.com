The contrast in this image was extreme, the foreground almost black.
This is the situation where I normally use DxO and its "PRIME" noise
reduction.

Actually I rarely use DxO Photolab at all these days. Lightroom has
become so good, that I can use it for almost any purpose. I may go
to Photoshop for some "_Edit / Transform / Skew_" magic, and I use
DxO for noise reduction in high dynamic range cases like this, or
for all that is above ISO 400. In any case, final processing is done
in Lightroom.
