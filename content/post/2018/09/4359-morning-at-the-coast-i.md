Well, I wouldn't rank yesterday's image and today's among my best,
but the remarkable thing is, that they've both been taken with the
Olympus TG-5, a tough outdoor camera, but otherwise a small-sensor
compact like in the olden days.

But maybe not. The camera has a fine lens, raw support, and what I
get out of it in good light is hardly different from what I get from
proper "adult" cameras.

I'll let a few images follow in the next posts.
