Final actions are always a little scary, because they are, well,
final, I guess :stuck_out_tongue:

My account at JustHost will expire in two days. I've just deleted
the credit card information from the account and, what's more final,
I've executed `rm -rf ./*` in my home directory. There is nothing
left to be looked up, there is no WordPress instance any more.

I've done a few things more though:

* On this site I've created redirects from [/feed](/feed) and from
  [/feeds/posts/default](/feeds/posts/default) to
  [http://feeds.feedburner.com/photography-andreas-manessinger](http://feeds.feedburner.com/photography-andreas-manessinger),
  my feedburner URL. The first is the default feed URL of 
  WordPress installations, the second one is that of Blogger.
  Remember that I suspect I've lost subscribers? If all goes well, 
  I should see some of them again soon.

* Finally I've created a wildcard email forward for manessinger.com.
  Every email that addresses any user name at manessinger.com will
  be forwarded to my Gmail account. I've had that for the domain
  andreas-manessinger.info for the last decade, but at JustHost
  I didn't have the option for wildcard forwarding. I had one single
  email address registered for manessinger.com, but since the 
  switch to the new domain registrar, that email address had been
  unavailable. That was a stupid mistake, because some people still
  might use the address.

It looks like these were the final steps in my switch away from 
WordPress to a serverless infrastructure, but of course you never 
know :smiley:
