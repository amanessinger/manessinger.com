Carinthia's lakes may be warmer, the landscape may be comparably
beautiful, but what undeniably speaks for Salzkammergut's lakes is,
that they are not completely surrounded by rich people's houses. 

In Carinthia the landscape is marred by scattered houses everywhere,
and around the lakes there's hardly a free spot. Almost everything
is privately owned and commercially exploited. Not so much here.
