This is Attersee again, this time from the western shore. The image
is a stitched panorama, something that's trivial to make in
Lightroom. The result is slightly over 40 Megapixels and I probably
could have achieved a similar result using the E-M1 ii's
sensor-shift high-res mode. I'd have had to use a tripod though, and
that's something I rarely use at all these days :smiley:

There's a rumored OM-D E-M1X, that will even do away with the need
for tripods in one of its high-res modes. It's pretty unlikely that
I'll buy it though. It will have an integrated battery grip (think
of Canon 1dx or Nikon D5, only slightly smaller) and will be
targeted at pro sports photographers. Too big and heavy for me, too
many features that I don't ever need at all, and that for a hefty
3000â‚¬.

On the other hand, it's good to see Olympus staying aggressively
competitive. I'd hate to see a system die, that I have quite an
investment in. Looks like it won't happen any time soon
