One of Attersee's most striking features is the beautiful color of
its water. I've always praised Carinthia's WÃ¶rthersee for its
turquoise water, but it's really no comparison. Attersee easily
wins.

The interesting thing is, that of all those lakes in immediate
neighborhood, Attersee is the only one with such a color. I have no
idea why, but it's beautiful.
