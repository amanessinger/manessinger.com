That's exactly what I meant: here we have a strip of lake shore in
best, sunny location. It's freely accessible to the public, people
swim there and it doesn't cost a cent. Unthinkable in Carinthia.

I don't know exactly why this is the case. It must be a matter of
politics. In any case, if this spot were on the market, it would go
for a fortune. The decision to preserve it is that more laudable.
