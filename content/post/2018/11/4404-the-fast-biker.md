I'd love to say I have composed this image, but of course I haven't.
[Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) and I went back over one
of Vienna's main bridges to where his boat was moored. It was late
in the evening, light was golden and when I saw this graffiti, I
wanted to take an image. Just that moment a biker raced across the
frame. Perfect accident :smiley:

And that's it. That's where Ted and I parted - after a long, hot and
intellectually exciting day. I tried to make a last image of Ted and
failed, he made two of me and spectacularly succeeded.
