Salzkammergut is a region of many lakes. Most of them are in Upper
Austria, a few reach into Salzburg. Most of them are colder than the
Carinthian lakes that I'm used to. The climate is harsher here, so
if you intend to swim, you'd better come in mid-summer. Mid-August
was a safe bet. Still, Traunsee for instance had only 19 degrees
Celsius in one of the hottest summers so far.
