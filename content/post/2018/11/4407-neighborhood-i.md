We're back to Vienna and its sprawl at the periphery. Here we have
endless apartment buildings with not much differentiation. The
complex where I have taken this and the next image is actually one
of the better.

Now, the question is (and it is an important question in our
civilization and in this time): How can you feel somewhere at home,
when everything looks the same? And: is "Home" just a concept that
we should deprecate? Or is feeling "at home" part of being human?
Are we less human, when we are less home? Or is this just
tribalization and the opposite is true?
