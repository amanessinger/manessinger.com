[Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) hates graffiti, but then, he's house owner.

Donaukanal, a tamed side-arm of river Danube, that's how Vienna's
center has always been connected to the river. Today there's a
promenade with caf√©s and restaurants, and the application of
graffiti along the channel is accepted. Often in winter I go there
for some strong colors.
