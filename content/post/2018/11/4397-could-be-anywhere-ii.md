It's sad how modern office architecture has converged on buildings
with a shiny glass skin and open-plan offices. Have you ever worked
in an open-plan office? It's distracting, depressing and it kills
creativity. I had the displeasure for a few years and I hate them
with a passion.
 
As subjects of photography I can live with them though :smiley:
