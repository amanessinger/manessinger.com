This post is scheduled for November 11. On 11 11, at 11:11,
that's the start of the carnival season in German speaking countries
of Europe. Villach is the capital of carnival in Austria, and here
carnival is met with the same almost religious fervor as summer's
Kirchtag festival.

Again: if you haven't been born here, forget about understanding
Villach, its people and their mentality. It doesn't matter though.
It's a nice, pleasant place to live, and people seem to be happier
here.
