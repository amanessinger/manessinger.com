Today's cameras are more or less good enough in terms of dynamic range, at least as long as you expose correctly. The OM-D E-M1ii certainly is.

I wanted to emphasize the altar, and therefore I gave it a tad more light than it originally received.

This is the old monastery's church. I can't think of a better place to present a richly decorated gothic altar. I've no idea if this is the original altar of this church, but I strongly suppose it's not.
