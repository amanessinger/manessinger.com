You may wonder what became of my blog project.

Well, I've tried <a href="https://hexo.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hexo</a> and it did convert the blog. Around 4300 files were converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Markdown</a> in less more than a few minutes. I did it in a virtual machine in <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>, because I hate it to install test software directly on my Mac.

Then I wanted to use Hexo for conversion of the Markdown files to static HTML.

Oh my! After slightly more than one hour Hexo crashed, running out of memory. This was while still loading the files. Not a single HTML file had yet been produced.

I'm pretty sure that I would have had a better result natively on my 16GB Macbook Pro. The virtual machine had only 2GB of memory and that is seemingly not enough to load my blog when converted to Javascript objects.

I've made no further inquiries, I didn't try to give the machine more memory, I just gave up on Hexo. It may be unfair, but trust can be damaged very quickly ðŸ™‚
