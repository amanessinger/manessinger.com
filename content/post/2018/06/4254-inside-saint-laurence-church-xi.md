This site lists them all: <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StaticGen</a>. If I've counted correctly, there are 224 open source projects to choose from. All of them somehow generate static websites. At least half of them would on first sight be applicable to my problem. 

It's not that there's nothing out there to choose from. The problem ist how to avoid analysis paralysis ðŸ™‚
