Migrating the blog to another system?

I've already done this when I went from Blogger.com to a self-hosted Wordpress on my own shared hosting server.

I can't remember how exactly I did it (but I could look it up on the blog!). It must have involved an export from Blogger and a few Perl scripts (Perl is a programming language that I used to use for such tasks). I could take a similar approach again.

The question is, where would I want to go?
