The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Germanic National Museum</a> is situated in a former monastery. This rather impressive view is from the former Great Cloister of the Nuremberg Charterhouse.

The monastery was dissolved in 1525, and when the museum was founded, it was already in bad shape. From the outside, the modern structure built into what remained after WWII is hardly recognizable as a former monastery at all.
