Let's get back to that blogging issue. I've started a few experiments. The first thing was, to find out if I can use one of my daily database backups to get a copy of the database running on my laptop. Migrating the database to something else, for instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Markdown</a> files in a certain directory structure, is something I want to do on my development machine.

Yup, I can run the database locally, and I can get at the data with a programming language, for instance Python. That's OK, I'm in control. It means that, in the worst case, I can write my new solution all by myself.

Now it's time to look at what the market has to offer.
