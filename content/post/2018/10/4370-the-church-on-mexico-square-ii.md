In 1938, when Austria was annexed by Hitler's Third Reich, only one
country protested against it. That was Mexico. We still remember,
and that's the reason, why there is a Mexico Square.

The church on that square, devoted to Francis of Assisi, was built
in the two decades between the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century
until after World War I.
