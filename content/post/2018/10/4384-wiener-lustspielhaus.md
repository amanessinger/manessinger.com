After Rathausplatz, [Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) and I
spent an hour in the shade of a tree in the beautiful patio of
Vienna's University. Of course It's another faux-renaissance
building, and of course it's not the only university location in
Vienna, but that's what you mean, when you just say "The
University". We discussed politics and of course the phenomenon that
is Trump :smiley:

After that, we went right to the center of the center. Everything
looks expensive and palatial here, which can be kind of boring as
well. Fortunately you'll always find something unexpected like this
comedy theater tent.
