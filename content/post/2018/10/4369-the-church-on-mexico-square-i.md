[Ted Byrne](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) and I had scheduled
our meeting for 8 am. There were scattered clouds and I could only
hope that the weather would hold.

I was early, and so I went to see whether the church on nearby Mexico
Square was open. It's a relatively new church, only a hundred years,
but it is quite big and I had never been there.
