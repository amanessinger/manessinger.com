So it's the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm F4.0 IS Pro. But why?

First of all, it's got excellent reviews. Basically everybody says
this lens is insanely sharp across the range, beginning wide open
(which, admittedly, is not very wide).

Yes, you can't have shallow DOF, at least not for typical situations
like portraits. On the other hand, I am not as interested in shallow
DOF as I was ten years ago. I take most of my images at apertures
between 4.0 and 8.0.

Yes, a starting aperture of 4.0 means that I have less light and I
will have to compensate with higher ISO. That's correct, this is not
a low light lens. It is stabilized (in-lens stabilization working
along with in-body stabilization) to an insane degree, but an f1.2
lens with in-body stabilization will beat it in low light. No
comparison.

The real reason is versatility. This is an excellent zoom that makes
only one compromise, namely with its starting aperture. If you can't
live with that, that is no lens for you. If you can, this lens may
be your best investment ever.

It's been a year and two months since I bought the lens. I've used
it on vacations, I've experienced its single weakness and I've seen
its fabulous quality. Normally I couple it with the 7-14/2.8 PRO,
and if I think I might have use for something shallower, I can
always add the feather-weight that is the 45/1.8 or maybe the
25/1.8, if I feel more like that. Or maybe the manual Mitakon
Speedmaster 25/0.95, if I don't mind the slightly higher weight.

What I get is the convenience to not have to change lenses most of
the time. For me it is the perfect vacation lens, at least in cases
when I have to haul my equipment all day. Nowadays I only use the
three 2.8 zooms, when I mostly drive around by car. For everything
else I love this lens.
