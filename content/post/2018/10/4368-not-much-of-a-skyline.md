I made this image the evening before my friend [Ted
Byrne](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) arrived in Vienna. With
his wife he was on a trip across Europe by river boat. For one day
he would be in Vienna and I had promised to show him as much as
would be possible.

This is approximately the place where I expected his ship to berth.

In reality the correct place would have been a hundred meters
upstream, on the other side of the bridge. He had no phone
connectivity, WiFi on the ship was flaky, and I was anxious about us
possibly missing each other. We have kind of a tradition with that.
When we met in Florence, Italy last time, we lost each other
