I haven't seen most of the images
[Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) took. Mine, well, I live
here. I can see everything every day. I can look past all things
that normally catch your eyes. Sometimes this is bad, because by
automatically blocking certain things from your view, you miss
details that in reality you've never seen.

Sometimes the opposite is true.

We were in a lot of tourist locations. Small wonder, the whole
purpose of our expedition was, to show Ted as many sights as
possible in a day. A few have sneaked in my album, most have not.
You might have seen many of them during the last dozen years
