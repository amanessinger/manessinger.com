[Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) and I had not seen each
other in ... what? Ten years? Did not matter. When we finally met,
it was the start of a tour de force through my Vienna and each
other's thoughts.

We used the Underground to quickly get around. The first stop was
Karlsplatz. This is a detail of the decoration in the Underground
station.
