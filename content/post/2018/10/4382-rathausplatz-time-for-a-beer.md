[Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) loves German food and
especially Pretzels. Easy to get, here on the square in front of
Vienna's City Hall. Actually we wouldn't have had a problem to get
any kind of food here. Almost round the year there are food stalls
where you get all sorts of European, Middle East, East Asian and who
knows what specialties. It's not necessarily the place to go for the
best pizza or the best moussaka or the best sushi, but it's a great
place to taste yourself across the world.
