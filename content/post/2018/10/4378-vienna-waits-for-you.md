I love this image. [Ted](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/) and I
took the escalator up to the terrace of Albertina, Vienna's most
important collection of Graphical Art. I saw the reflection in the
window and reflexively took the image. You can't call that a well
planned shot. Not really.

But look at it: Everything's there! 

* Behind the glass a menu with Wiener Schnitzel and lots of other
  typically viennese meals. 
  
* Three horse carts, in Vienna called "Fiaker". 
  
* To the left in the background Alfred Hrdlicka's Monument against
  Fascism. 
  
* To the right in the windows on the far side we see posters of 
  Egon Schiele and Siegmund Freud. 
  
Any clich√© missing?

Now that I think of it, the escalator didn't move, we had to climb.
The glass was very dark and I had to use 1/6 s. Had it moved, the
shot would have been impossible.
