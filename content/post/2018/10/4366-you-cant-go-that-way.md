A few days ago in [4361 - Morning At The Coast
III](/2018/09/4361-morning-at-the-coast-iii.html) I talked about the
culture of reality denial that's fueled by populism. Got a
complicated problem? Just pretend it's not there.

Of course denying facts does not simply make them go away. You can
do it, but only for so long. Normally reality finds its way back to
us.

Imagine my surprise when I found [this
article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-sees-a-7-degree-rise-in-global-temperatures-by-2100/2018/09/27/b9c6fada-bb45-11e8-bdc0-90f81cc58c5d_story.html).
Well, it's the Washington Post and the source alone will make it
incredible for a certain kind of Trump believers. But that's not the
point.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states in a
leaked draft of an Environmental Impact Statement that human-made
climate change is going to have a much higher impact, than any part
of the Trump Administration has ever admitted. They also seem to say
(I haven't completely read and far less analysed the paper; I just
quote the WP) that it's too late anyway, and that therefore the
lowering of environmental standards does not do additional harm.

Is this good? Is this bad? I think it may be a first step in the
right direction. Currently the Fundamentalists and Apocalyptics may
rule, and they may believe that they'll be among the 144 thousand
who God will save anyway, but hopefully among Trump's voters a
certain feeling will develop, that mathematically they have a tiny
problem: 144 thousand won't suffice to save all their lot.

Fear might finally do the thing. I mean, it works with fear of
migrants, why shouldn't it also work with fear of drowning? A few
more once-in-a-lifetime experiences will make it much harder to
ignore reality.

And then, maybe, there will be a point when people get back to being
constructive. Sure, precious time will have been wasted, but this
seems to be the fate of our species. We're always trying the cheap
way out first.

By the way: I've taken this image immediately after I bought a new lens, the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm F4.0 IS Pro :smiley:
