Obviously [Saint Stephen's
Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna)
is the one church nobody else can avoid either. Luckily I could avoid people's heads and shoot two detail images with long focal lengths. This image has an equivalent focal length of 150 mm and was taken at ISO 200 and 0.4 s. Handheld :smiley:
