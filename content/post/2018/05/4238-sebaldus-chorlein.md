A "Chörlein" is a small choir. This is a specialty of Nuremberg. Rich patricians had small chapels in their private homes, with the choirs prominently protruding. I haven't seen this anywhere else so far, and of course many of them have been damaged during the war.

The "Sebaldus-Chörlein" of today is a reconstruction of the most beautiful one. You find it, as you may guess, on a house opposite of Saint Sebaldus. I had planned to make a series of images of different examples, but in the short time I had to make compromises and this is the only usable image that I've got.
