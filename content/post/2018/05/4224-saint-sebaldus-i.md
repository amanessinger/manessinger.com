Finally Saint Sebaldus. Remember, this church had been destroyed almost completely. Good job, huh?

Oh yes, and, if you think this is small for the choir and altar of a major church, don't be disappointed. This is one of the few churches that have altars on both sides. This is where normally the big portal would be ðŸ™‚

Actually, when I think of it, I have only seen that style of double-choired church in Germany so far. Worms is another example, Mainz is one more.
