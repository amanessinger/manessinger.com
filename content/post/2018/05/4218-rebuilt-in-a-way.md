If you suspect that this is a rather liberal reconstrution of the mediaeval way of living, I guess you're not altogether right ðŸ˜„

This is in the eastern part of the castle area, the part where the fire storm was most devastating. Let's look at a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrnberger_Burg#/media/File:N%C3%BCrnberg_Stich_1830.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">steel engraving from 1830</a>. The building in the background, to the right side, that's what we're looking at here. Pretty similar, huh?
