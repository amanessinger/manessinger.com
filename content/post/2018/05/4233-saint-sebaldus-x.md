I'm pretty sure this is the tabernacle. In a normal church with a normal altar, it would be part of the altar. This isn't a normal church though. This is a money machine, and where normally the altar would have been, Saint Sebaldus has the reliquary casket behind its plain altar table. Thus the tabernacle had to be set into the back wall. Priorities, architecturally expressed ðŸ™‚
