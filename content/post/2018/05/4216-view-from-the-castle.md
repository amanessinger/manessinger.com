I can claim neither artfulness nor originality for this picture. Still, that's what you see when you look from the castle.

The church in the foreground, almost below the castle, this is Saint Sebaldus. The church on the left is Saint Laurence, situated in the other half of the Old Town, south of the river. The castle-like building with the green roofs to the left, that's the old City Hall. We've seen all of them from outside so far.
