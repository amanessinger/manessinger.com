So important was the reliquary casket, that the church lacks an impressive main altar. Instead it only has a big cross hanging above the shrine.

I would have found it equally plausible if the altar had just been destroyed during the war, but no, I've just checked. The Nazis, always caring more for things than for people, have secured the precious internal furnishing under ground.
