It is almost impossible to capture the architectural Big Picture without such a lens. On the other hand it's equally impossible to get a feeling from these pictures for how the space really feels. 

Ultra-wide perfectly captures overall geometry, and when you use weird perspectives and angles, the effect can be outright confusing. That's all fine and it satisfies my hunger for the ornamental. After a while though, I invariably switch back to a more "normal" lens, used in a conservative way. The 12&nbsp;mm (24&nbsp;mm&nbsp;eq) used here are still a little wide, but what you see is very invocative of what it feels like to stand in Saint Sebaldus' awsome gothic choir.
