Let's look at another variation of the same problem. 

Is this true to what I saw? Maybe.

Is this true to what the camera's algorithm reported as correct
white balance? Definitely not!

Is it true to what I remember? Well, actually I can't remember
:smiley:

And there is one more thing: If you look at such a scene in real
life, and if you look long enough, your "vision" begins to adapt.
There is a temporal factor as well. Basically we have to decide if
we want to be true to a short glance or a long examination. Of
course the same is true for the viewer of the image. It's
complicated :stuck_out_tongue:
