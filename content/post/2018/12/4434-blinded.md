This is a morning view from my small apartment in Vienna. It's a
mere three minutes from work.

It's not the most beautiful view, I admit, but it won't last anyway.
Currently an apartment block is being under construction. The
distance will be generous enough, but it will block the evening sun
in summer. Hey, that's life :smiley:
