I have never had a Mac until four years ago. At that time my laptop,
a 1.5&nbsp;kg Sony VAIO made of carbon fiber, had become unbearably
slow and needed to be replaced. The trouble was, there was no
powerful and light Windows Ultrabook at that time. I ended up buying
a MacBook Pro at 2.1&nbsp;kg and an ultralight bag :smiley:

I had always held Apple in high esteem and had recommended Macs to
normal users, given they could afford them. When I finally could
myself, I soon found out that a Mac is not worlds ahead of Windows
or Linux any more, not even in terms of user experience. But it's a
slick and beautiful system and Adobe software runs on it. Beautiful,
that's what Windows never was and still not is, and Adobe, well, to
Lightroom I'm addicted, which strictly rules out Linux.

That my new gaming computer is a Windows machine, this is due to the
fact that gaming on Mac and Linux is still badly supported by the
major gaming studios. Games today, especially open-world role
playing games, are highly complex endeavors, achievable only by big,
dedicated teams, rivaled only by Hollywood productions. 

AAA games can cost a hundred million dollars today. Many of those
games are repetitive trash (like the movies), but if you want to see
photo-realism and if you are in for maximum visual immersion, AAA is
the way to go. Thankfully there are a few games within AAA category,
that also have depth and originality.
[Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim), as I
mentioned yesterday, is one of them.

But gaming is only one facet. In two years my Mac will still have
great hardware for what I need in photography and programming, but
it will fall out of Apple's supported range of computers for new
versions of the operating system. That alone is a reason to think
about a successor.

It's hard to tell how the market will look like in two years. Had it
been like today four years ago, I'd likely never have bought a Mac.
If I had to buy today, the obvious choice would be the Dell XPS 15
with 2&nbsp;TB SSD, 32&nbsp;GB RAM and a hexa-core Intel&nbsp;i9.
You can have something similar from Apple, minus an SD card reader
and proper interfaces, but for a much, much higher price.

What I also do with my gaming computer, is trying to find out
whether I could easily abandon the Mac and go back to Windows for my
laptop. Turns out I could.

In terms of behavior, the UIs of the three major operating systems
can be configured to work almost identically. Apple has dumbed down
its virtual desktop _Spaces_ several versions ago. It only supports
a linear string of desktops any more. Same with Windows, same with
most Linux UIs.

That's not exactly OK for me (on Linux I had much more flexibility
20 years ago), but I can live with it. I've configured my Mac and
Linux desktops to use the lower right _Hot Corner_ to switch to a
desktop overview mode (called _Mission Control_ on the Mac), and
that was the only thing missing on Windows. No Hot Corners.

Not any more. A few days ago I found an open source utility called
[WinXcorners](https://apps.codigobit.info/2015/10/winxcorners-hot-corners-for-windows-10.html),
and that is exactly what I need. Finally I can configure Windows to
not exactly look, but definitely feel like my other systems. Sweet!

In terms of productivity software I have never even started using
Apple products. Too much fear of being locked in. Probably the only
program that I'd miss on Windows is
[Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/), but I am not a power user and on
Windows I would probably switch to [Affinity
Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) or, for simple
tasks, to the open source [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). All
other programs that I use are cross-platform anyway, most of them
supported under Linux as well.

No, I wouldn't miss the Mac.
