Normally I don't arrange images. I take what I see. Well, I'm guilty of having removed a twig or two from a waterfall and such things, but I haven't done that in a long time. It's not because I value "purity" or anything like that, it's mostly because I don't care. If something is distracting, I can always remove it in post.

I took them at 
the wall of my father's workshop. 

Almost two months after his death I felt kind of a hole in my
life. I still do.
