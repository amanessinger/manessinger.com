This is the office building where I spent more than 20 years of my
professional life so far. It was built by viennese architect Harry
Gl√ºck in 1980. In 1987 I had my first internship there. It turned
out to be interesting, multi-faceted and demanding, and so I stuck
to it through all the years.

In the meantime the building has been demolished. We'll see a few
images of different stages of the process in the following weeks.
