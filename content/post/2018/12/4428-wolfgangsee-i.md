Sankt Gilgen is not much more than a village, but it's a quite nice
one.

they are on most lakes in Austria. You need a license, and the total
number of licenses is restricted. In Carinthia this has led to an
expensive market for licenses, and having your own motorboat is a
status symbol for the rich.

It's not exactly a fair system, as it makes access to motorboats
practically impossible for the average well-off citizen, but
restricting the number is necessary, or otherwise water quality
would suffer.

Again, this is in Carinthia, where expensive lakeside residences
existed for a century. I'm pretty sure on Wolfgangsee motorboats are
limited to a few businesses only.
