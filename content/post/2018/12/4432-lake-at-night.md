This "lake" is actually a river, a kilometer upstream from a power
station. 

Although the image has been taken at ISO 200, I've processed it with
DxO's PRIME noise reduction. The reason is, that I had to expose for
the moon, which left pretty much everything else in deepest shadow.
The result is well balanced and pretty usable, if you ask me.
