Suburbs. Everything is artificial, every aspect of the landscape is
created. But so are today's forests, today's meadows, today's river
valleys. So it has been for centuries.

Sometimes I wonder what it must have looked like when it was ...
pristine? We are not far from river Danube. Swamps and forests,
that's what it must have been. And no people to tell about it.
