Sometimes I work too much. In recent months I did. Last Friday I was
so underpowered and overworked, that I quit a remarkably
unsuccessful work day at 3&nbsp;pm. I needed to do something completely
different, and I needed to do so quickly.

What I did was drive the 30&nbsp;km to Klagenfurt, in order to buy
the only gaming computer available in Carinthia.

I did something quite similar a year ago, when I bought a Sony
Playstation 4 Pro and a Playstation VR. A year ago I ended up using
it almost exclusively to play a re-textured and slightly modernized
version of 2011's fantasy RPG hit 
[Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim).

My new computer is an [HP Omen
880-190ng](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06145803). It's
actually a pretty capable computer with a recent and decent six-core
CPU and a very strong graphics card. Of course I've thrown a few
pieces of potent software at it and it didn't even flinch. [The
Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt](https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3) in 4k
resolution, with all goodies turned up? No problem.

The latest pre-alpha [Unreal
Tournament](https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/) in 4k,
everything turned up? No problem either.

The latest 3DMark? A little bit strained, in fact it wouldn't be
playable in 4k, but you won't see such a mass of polygons and
shading effects in any game soon.

Having checked all that, what do I do? I play
[Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim) again,
everything maxed out, in 4k and with buttery smooth 60&nbsp;fps. I
love those [Elder Scrolls](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/) games
:smiley:

Oh, btw: Merry Christmas, if that means something to you. Happy
Holidays!
