I've made a lot more images in Sankt Gilgen, but as it happens with
holiday trips, most of them are documentary only and not interesting
for the blog. Here's one from the inside of the church.

Baroque, just as most churches in Austria. Austria was the center of
the Holy Roman Empire, and as such it was also the heart of
counter-reformation. In the time following, which coincides with the
age of Baroque, the interiors of most churches were refurbished.
