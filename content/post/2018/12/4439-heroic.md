This is a small monument in Aspern. Aspern was the site of one major
battle in the Napoleonic Wars. The Austrians had a small victory
there, but of course they lost the war. Shortly after, the walls of
most of Austria's fortresses were torn down. Vienna's magnificent
Ringstraße later was built where the inner walls of Vienna had been.

As to heroism, I think the monument shows the situation anyway: wars
were fought for the glorification of the Emperor. Soldiers were mere
material.

Actually I can think of good reasons why Napoleon might have felt
compelled to fight a war against England and the Holy Roman Empire.
Napoleon was a shunned upstart and the french people had toppled the
Ancien Régime. All those powers around France tried to meddle with
french politics and supported a return to the "Natural Holy Order".
England and the Empire were not only natural foes, they were a real
danger for the young french state.

But Russia? What business did Napoleon have in Russia? And was it
heroic of his soldiers to perish in the russian winter?
