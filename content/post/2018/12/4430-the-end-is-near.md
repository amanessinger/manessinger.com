It was the day before my father died. In the evening I got a phone
call from my mother, urging me to come home as soon as possible. I
did, early next day, but when I arrived, he was already dead.

More than a year later, it still shocks me. Knowing that a loved
person will die is one thing. The actual loss is another.
