This glass wall is part of a complex called "Kranzler Eck", named after a "Café Kranzler" at that corner. The café is still there, although it is now far from having any visual dominance. We stayed in the hotel opposite of this wall, therefore I was there when the sun set, interior lights went on and things began to look interesting.
