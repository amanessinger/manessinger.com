We Austrians are snobbish about food. Our own cuisine is heavily influenced by Czech and Hungarian food, and of course in southern Austria the influence of Italy is equally strong. In any case we believe that German food is vastly inferior to what we enjoy here.

And this is not entirely true. I've had my share of bad coffee in Germany, I had to endure some really bad meals, but you can have that in Vienna anytime. Just go to the wrong restaurants.

Berlin's specialties like calf's liver with apples and onions are absolutely delicious. Even the omni-present sausage with curry (Currywurst, here sold from this van) can be fine. 

By the way, the same is true for other parts of Germany. I still have fond memories of Nuremberg :smiley:
