Strausberger Platz is the first big square in Karl-Marx-Allee, with a big fountain at the center of a roundabout. There are more than just traces of former glory, yet neglect is everywhere.

Visually the architecture looks as if it tried to compete with US architecture from 50 years earlier. There's nothing wrong with that though. It's a style that I like.
