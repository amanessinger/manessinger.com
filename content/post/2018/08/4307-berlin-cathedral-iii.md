One of the challenges of shooting multiple images in the same place is, that each particular spot has subtely different light. Of course you don't see it when you're there, but the effect is real. Same lens, more or less same time, a few meters apart, and still you may need to match white balance. You'll see the effect of failing to do so tomorrow.
