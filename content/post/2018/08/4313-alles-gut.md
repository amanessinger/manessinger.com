A few things have happened. This is the first day in more than a week 
that I actually write a post. In the meantime I have finished my 
[migration tool](https://github.com/amanessinger/wordpress-xml-to-hugo).

I have also ported the blog over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You can
see the result under the temporary URL 
[https://blog.andreas-manessinger.info/](https://blog.andreas-manessinger.info/). I invite you to have a look, but please
don't bookmark it. 

For the next few days I will post on both sides, old and new, and 
when I'm convinced that everything is stable, I'll change the URL 
of the new blog to [https://manessinger.com](https://manessinger.com). 
This will cause something between a few minutes and one or two hours
of unavailability, and that's the reason why I have not done it yet. 
I want to make sure that everything is fine or, as they say in Berlin,
"Alles gut!".

Alles gut? All well?

Mostly. The blog has been ported and the layout is still a tad spartan.
This is intentional on one hand, on the other hand a thumbnail of the
Image of the Day in the list would be nice to have and, even more so, 
I'd like to not only show you past comments, but also give you the 
opportunity to post new ones :smiley:

A lot of things have not been automated yet. One of them is what I 
mentioned in yesterday's post: scheduled posting. The difference to
last week is, that I now know exactly how to do it 
:stuck_out_tongue:
