That's quite an impressive name, huh? This is deeply Catholic territory. Here even the religious orders have embassies ðŸ™‚

And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this order</a> has an impressive age as well. 900 years, that's older than most states in the world!
