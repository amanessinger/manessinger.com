Actually I was pretty sure which street I had taken after I left Saint Martin's. It's just that I couldn't find that damn spire on Google Maps. Well, it took me some time, but now I know that this is KapitulskÃ¡, the very same street that I have crossed a little earlier, the street with the red door ðŸ™‚

Ahead you see the Clarissine Church. We'll get there soon.
