The trip from Vienna to Bratislava was fairly short and entertaining. The trip back ... not so much. It took twice the time, and part of it it was already quite dark. I spent the time on deck reading "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Lamp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Night Lamp</a>" by Jack Vance.
