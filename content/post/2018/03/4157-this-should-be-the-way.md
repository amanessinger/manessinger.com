Bratislava was a small town on the Hungarian side of the internal border between Hungary and Austria. In a way it was special, because coronations of the Hungarian kings took place there since the time when the capital had been occupied by the Ottoman Empire. Still, coronations didn't happen all that often, and in the times between, this was just a sleepy small town. That's what the Old Town still looks like, despite the modern buildings surrounding it.
