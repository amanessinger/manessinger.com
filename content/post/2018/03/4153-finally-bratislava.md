This suspension bridge carries one of the most important streets in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bratislava" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bratislava</a>. It connects the more modern south-western half of the city with the Old Town. The "flying saucer" atop is a restaurant.

I haven't been there long enough that it would have made sense to cross over to the other side. All you'll see in the next weeks will be from the Old Town.
