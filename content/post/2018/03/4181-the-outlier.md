Frequently I accept the constraints of lines having to run into corners. It's nothing general, it's just something I personally am neurotic about ðŸ™‚

This image is an example of a different kind of constraint. I wantend the lowest window to be the only one entirely reflecting the red facade of the building behind me, and I also wanted the intersection of the lines in the reflection dead in the center of the window. Other than that I was able to choose an angle, a crop and finally a color cast. 

I decided to largely eliminate the red cast and I may have neutralized the wall more than it correctly is. It didn't any harm though. The strong saturation in both sky and red reflection gave me more than enough leeway.
