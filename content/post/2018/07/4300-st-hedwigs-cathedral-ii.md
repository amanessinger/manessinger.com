No news about my blog transition to <a href="http://gohugo.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hugo</a>. I haven't had time for anything. The only news is, that the much feared July 22, the date when Google would start flagging pages without HTTPS in Chrome, has passed. 

Interestingly enough <a href="http://justhost.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">JustHost</a>, my hoster, sent me an email one or two days before, that they now provide free SSL certificates issued by <a href="http://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>. Along came detailed instructions for how to claim and install the certificate. When I tried to do that, to my surprise I found everything already in place. That's what I call service ðŸ™‚
