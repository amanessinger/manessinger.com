Image-wise I am now more than a year behind. It's true, I've become much less prodcutive, and this is mainly because work has become much, much  more interesting. Heck, I don't even find time to continue with my blog transition project!

Hmm ... guess I shouldn't complain ðŸ™‚

The image? That's the roof of Berlin's "Sony Center". Kind of a shopping mall. <a href="https://www.excire.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Excire</a>, a new Lightroom plugin for AI driven keyword classification that I'm just testing, has filed it under "Ferris Wheel". Excusable, I'd say.
