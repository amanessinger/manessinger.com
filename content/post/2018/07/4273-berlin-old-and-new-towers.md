I probably wouldn't have visited Nuremberg, if it hadn't been on the way to Berlin. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed Nuremberg, but the main target was Berlin.

In the foreground you see the ruined part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Wilhelm_Memorial_Church" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church</a>, today a monument to the horrors of WWII. Only the ruins of the tower have been left standing, when the church was rebuilt in modern style. We'll be inside of the modern building in due time.
