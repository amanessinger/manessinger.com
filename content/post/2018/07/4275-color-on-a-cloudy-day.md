Normally when I visit a city, I have a plan. Normally I've read something. Normally I know what to expect.

Not so in Berlin. I bought some tourist guides, had a look into them and almost immediately gave up. Too big!

Basically we decided to just wander through the city, experience how it feels, get an impression and - eventually come back.
