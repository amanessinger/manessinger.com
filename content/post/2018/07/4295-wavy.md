In doubt, I'd say, never start a war just to get some amazing new architecture, but that's in fact a side effect of the damage suffered in WWII: Much new architecture has been built. Some very poor, some good and some outright amazing. This headquater of prosthetics company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottobock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ottobock</a> is among the best.
