Nuremberg was extremely hot and Berlin almost 10 degrees Celsius cooler. That's normal. If you go to Berlin in summer, don't expect hot summer weather. Doesn't happen. If you want that, I recommend Italy or Provence ðŸ™‚

Fortunately we were only a few meters away from GemÃ¤ldegalerie, a museum with a gallery of paintings that rivals Vienna, Madrid, Paris or London. 

Here are two Holbein portraits. Finest late-renaissance art. We have one or two very similar portraits in Vienna.
