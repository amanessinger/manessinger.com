OK, that's the last one. "Abuse" did I say. Why? Well, look at the "graves": 

<em>Soldato / Manzi / Luigi / 30&deg;Fanteria</em>

A title, a surname, a name and a regiment. No date. That's not a grave! They didn't care where and when Luigi Manzi was born or when he died. For them, he was nothing more than a function. That's what I mean by "Abuse".
