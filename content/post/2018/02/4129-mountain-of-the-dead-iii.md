Crosses are a Christian symbol and, regardless of how you see Christianity or generally religion, the original meaning was not one of decoration on a memorial for the glory of warfare. 

Nothing else is this hill: it's a symbol for the glory of Mussolini's legions. It fascinates me (I'm always fascinated by fascist architecture) and at the same time it disgusts me. Well, we'll see a lot more this year.
