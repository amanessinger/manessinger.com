Terrace after terrace, the walls full of names. Every one a dead soldier. On the friezes on top of the walls the word PRESENTE over and over. It's what soldiers say when they are called: Present! Ready!

This is an army of the dead. Ghastly, in a way. Kind of an eternal abuse of the fallen, if you ask me.
