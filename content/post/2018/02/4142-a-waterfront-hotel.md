This used to be a storage building and has been a hotel for maybe 20 years now. It was a Scandic Crown and now it is a Hilton. No idea how it is. I've never stayed there. Have you ever taken a hotel in your own town? I didn't but maybe one should. If I'd do so, however, there'd be more interesting alternatives in Vienna.
