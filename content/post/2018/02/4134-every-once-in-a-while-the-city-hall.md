This is Vienna's City Hall. I've been here two times last year, once in the morning before an event where I had to present one of our programs, and the other time when I spent a day showing around my friend <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a>. We'll come to that day in time ðŸ™‚
