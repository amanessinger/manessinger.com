This is Miramare, the castle built for the Emperor's (Franz Joseph, the old Emperor) brother, the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian. Nice place to stay, huh?

What did the idiot? He accepted Napoleon III's offer to make him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_I_of_Mexico" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emperor of Mexico</a>! Of course things went bad, Napoleon deserted him and he was executed by the Mexican government in 1867. His wife got away but fell insane. Speak of wasted opportunities.
