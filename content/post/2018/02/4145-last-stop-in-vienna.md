Seeing all of Vienna from the river has its merits, but in reality it's not all of Vienna, it's just the small part of the city that can be seen from the river. The Danube does not run exactly through Vienna's center. Far from it. This is neither London nor Paris nor New York. What you see is more or less what I've shown you so far, plus a few industrial buildings that I didn't care for.

Another problem is, that you have to wait at three stops within the city's borders. This was the last one.
