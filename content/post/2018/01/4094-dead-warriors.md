This is a monument for the fallen warriors in Italy's war for unity and independence. For every war you find those monuments, and you find them on both sides of the former front.

They are for the glory of the rulers who sent them to death. Look at those bodies: ancient heroes, immaculate supermen. The reality of war is different. It's unimaginable suffering and the stench of steaming blood, putrefying flesh and shit. There is no glory in war.
