When I took the image, I just found that extremely long abbreviation funny. I had no idea what it means. 

Well, Google is really good at that. Of course they have it indexed and it means "Ente Regionale per il diritto e le opportunitÃ  allo studio universitario", which Google translates as "Regional body for law and opportunities for university study". 

Hmm ... now I do have an idea. Nice door, by the way ðŸ™‚
