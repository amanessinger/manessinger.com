The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Monte_Grisa" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Santuario di Montegrisa</a> is not a small church. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20170527_121044_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20170527_121044_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's architecture is brutally modern, all composed of triangles and naked concrete, and in a way that contrasts interestingly with the paintings, photographs and in general that the place is busy with people, using it as a temple of worship.

It just doesn't look like that. Take out all the altars, put it in space and call it a warship of the Imperial Fleet. Darth Vader wouldn't look out of place here ðŸ™‚

Ugly? Beautiful? Yes, both, in a way. It's interesting in any case, and I love how this is not mainstream modern architecture.
