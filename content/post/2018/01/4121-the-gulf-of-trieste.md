Would be pretty foolish to be in such a place and not to make a panorama, right?

Stitching in Lightroom left me a big hole in the lower right corner. I took care of it in Photoshop. I didn't try to hide the problem altogether (using gradients and overlaying textures would have been possible), I just wanted to get rid of the distraction.

I admit this blog is not a good context for big panoramas ðŸ˜„
