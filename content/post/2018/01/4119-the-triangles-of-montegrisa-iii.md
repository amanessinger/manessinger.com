F8, 1/15s, ISO 200, thr range as dynamic as it gets and ... this camera is good enough. If there had been a basketball game going on under these conditions, I'd very likely sing a different tune, but as it is - and as what I take pictures of - the OM-D E-M1 Mk II is a perfect camera.

What if I'd frequently went to basketball games? Well, I'd buy a second camera with one long zoom. Nothing else.
