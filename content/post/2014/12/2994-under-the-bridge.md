I've been working a lot lately, weather was bad and I have not been on the train for almost a week. My cache of pre-produced blog posts is used up and this is the first post in a long time that has not appeared in time at 8pm. Let's keep it short and make sure that it appears at least today, can we? Thanks ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Under The Bridge" by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLvohMXgcBo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
