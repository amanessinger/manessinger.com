This is an image that I could have taken dozens of times. Maybe it would have been with different colors at a different time of the year, but it could have worked anyway. I just didn't see it though - up to now.

The Song of the Day is again "Street Lights" by Irma. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BdoDTwTfGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
