Here's another post with autumnal impressions collected during the last weeks.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20141109_114740_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20141109_114740_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The Image of the Day is interesting, because I've come to that tree at exactly the right day. One side, that exposed to the wind, had already been devoid of leaves, the other side was still in full color.

The Song of the Day is "Seasons Change" by Marketa Irglova. Hear this lovely song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_C4QtPHf6A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
