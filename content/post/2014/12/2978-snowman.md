OK, it's not a great image, but it's a great snowman ðŸ™‚

Btw, The red and white thing that it holds in his hand, that's a candy stick of a kind that we never had. It's another sign of colonialization, just like Santa Claus or Halloween. Sounds grumpy? Unfriendly to my US readers? Sorry, but I write this at the day the CIA torture report got released - partially. I mean, yeah, in our grandparent generation we here had the Nazis, but those were the honestly bad guys. They didn't even pretend. 

Civilization really, really has a problem in this world.

Anyway. There's still a Song of the Day. It's "Snowman" by XTC. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBh31EG_VyQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
