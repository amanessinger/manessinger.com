We've had a <a href="/2014/11/2958-long-line-of-cars-i.html" target="_blank">similar image</a> two weeks ago, that one made in the last light of a sunny day in Carinthua, this here at a cold evening in Vienna. While the 25/1.8 won't give me depth of field as shallow as the 75/1.8, it actually does pretty well as long as I focus closely. In fact, it's hard to spot which is which if you don't know it.

The Song of the Day is again "Long Line Of Cars" by Cake. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3wFxuuG-y0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
