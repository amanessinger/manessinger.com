As a photographer I love this time of the year. It's because of the rapid rate of change and the way things look different every day.

I've taken a few images of this tree and the street light over the course of weeks, and this one I like most. Just enough leaves left, already on the brink of death though. Morbid? You bet!

The Song of the Day is "Street Lights" by Irma. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BdoDTwTfGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
