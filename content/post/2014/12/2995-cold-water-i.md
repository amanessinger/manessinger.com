This image, along with tomorrow's and yesterday's, was taken on a cold and sunny day, shortly before the snow arrived. Still, it was so cold that I quickly lost my interest in taking images and was glad to return to the car.

The Song of the Day is "Cold Water" by Tom Waits. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CmN1xuIN5M" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
