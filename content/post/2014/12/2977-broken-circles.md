Decay is a wonderful state. Of course as a state it is as regular as it gets, because everything, once created, immediately begins to decay. First you don't see it, but when you wait some time, it begins to get interesting.

The Song of the Day is "Broken Circles" by the Levellers. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzggoZCDiiU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
