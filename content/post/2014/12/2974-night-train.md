You may have been following my struggle with Flickr for some while, how I felt elated when an image got explored and how I never understood why particular images made it and others didn't. Take for instance "<a href="/2014/12/2970-street-lights-ii.html" target="_blank">2970 - Street Lights II</a>". I love that image, I'm ecstatic about it (well, almost ðŸ˜„), I think it's one of my best in a long while, but on Flickr it earned not even a shrug. 

In a way that unpredictability took the fun out of Flickr. Images that I had hopes for just didn't take off, and although I see a general rise in views, it feels ... random. It's nice when it's happening, but whenever I feel like I'm working for it, the effect is negligible.

Well, you know how it is, there's always the impression that the grass us greener across the fence, and therefore I created accounts at <a href="https://500px.com/" target="_blank">500px.com</a> and <a href="http://www.ipernity.com/" target="_blank">ipernity.com</a>.

I started trying 500px and I liked it. There's a lot of good material over there, people are welcoming and for a few days I put my image on both Flickr and 500px. And then it happened.

I did not care. I did not care about Flickr any more and I certainly had not started caring about 500px. That's when I deleted the 500px account. I'm back to Flickr only and if there was one net effect of the whole episode, then it is that I care less about it and will spend less time creating other people's content.

I started using Flickr, because when I switched from IMatch to Lightroom, putting images on Flickr became painless and without any effort I had another backup for my full-size images. I think this is a healthy state and I'd better keep it at that ðŸ™‚
