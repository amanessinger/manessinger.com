Well, no mourning. Actually it's just a bench in front of our office building, a bench that I've passed a hundred times and that I feel I've finally documented adequately.

The Song of the Day is "The Mourner's Bench" from the Death In June album "But, What Ends When the Symbols Shatter?". Yeah, really! Thankfully it's already late July ðŸ˜„
