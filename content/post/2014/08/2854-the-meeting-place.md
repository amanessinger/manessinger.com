I was walking on the other side of the street and I just wanted to take an image of this interesting shadow of the streetlight. The street is very busy, therefore I fully expected to have to take more than one exposure. Normally when I get a car in the foreground, I immediately delete the image, but in this case, with the man with the cigarette in the background, a cigarette drooping in just the same angle as the shadow, I am glad I kept it ðŸ™‚
