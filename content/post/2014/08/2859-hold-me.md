And then, of course, there come good reasons to stick to color. These are the cables that hold yesterday's lift, and I really love the blue line, the green on the cables and that wonderful red dot, red like a drop of blood. I may have slightly exaggerated colors and contrasts, but who can say? For an image taken at night through a thick sheet of glass I guess it's fairly acceptable.

The Song of the Day is "Hold Me" by Kenny Rogers. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2v3YBqY4Jw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
