When I made this image of a richly painted ceiling in a small church, I did so at 0.3 seconds, f4, ISO 800 and handheld. I literally couldn't see what I was taking images of. To my naked eye the ceiling was beyond the edge of darkness. Would I buy a camera that could do the same at ISO 100? You bet! Do I need one? Hardly, I guess ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Edge of Darkness" by Eric Clapton. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpO0-IE7W9Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
