Well, this is probably not that much of an image, but in a way I like it. It's a fly screen soaked by rain. Yes, this lens has shallow depth of field and, yes, this lens is sharp. There was the inevitable trace of purple fringing, but of course Lightroom got completely rid of it. I probably should point you to the full size on Flickr, but I don't have it up yet. It will be on Flickr by the time you read it though. If you want to see the full size without moir√©, check out my <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/" target="_blank">photostream</a>.

The Song of the Day is "Every Drop of Rain" from "<a href="http://www.davidbyrne.com/archive/here_lies_love/" target="_blank">Here Lies Love</a>", a "theatrical experience" by David Byrne and Fatboy Slim. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lP5EZ8qJtBw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
