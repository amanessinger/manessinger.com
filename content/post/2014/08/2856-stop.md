A sign at the end of the train platform, friendly telling me not to step down on the tracks. Ok, I didn't. Not that it would have taken the sign ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Stop" from the Mike Bloomfield / Al Kooper album "From His Head To His Heart To His Hands". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdMf-86Evro" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
