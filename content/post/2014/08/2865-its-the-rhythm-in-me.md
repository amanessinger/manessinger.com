Long lenses make for small frames cut out of reality, and the longer the lens, the more choices I have from a certain point of view. In this case the image is about a certain balance between a smaller but denser right side and a bigger, more open left side. There is something in this image that just goes well with my inner rhythm.

The Song of the Day is "It's The Rhythm In Me" by Meschiya Lake and The Little Big Horns. See them live on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXR8guXVLr8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
