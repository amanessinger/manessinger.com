Do you like walking in the night? I do, and I also enjoy being alone. With hardly any traffic and armed with a long lens you can take images from places where you couldn't stand safely during daytime, and even if you could, there would always be people messing up your composition. Ok, I admit, I am misanthropic ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is for the second time "Deep Night" by Frank Sinatra. Hear it on YouTube if you haven't done so yesterday, or else wait for tomorrow, because there'll be a third post in this mini-series.
