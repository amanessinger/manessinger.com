You may remember my decision to never again buy paper and plastic, i.e. printed books and music CDs. Even remember that I've decided to stop buying music downloads and do streaming via Spotify instead?

Well, it's a success. Reading e-books has made me a much more active reader and hearing music on Spotify constantly lets me discover great music made by artists I've never before heard of. Wanna hear an example? "The Train" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_Hippies" target="_blank">17 Hippies</a>, a group that has been in business for a long time but never caught my attention. It is a great song and a good example for the quality of their other music. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMQegpqfHm4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
