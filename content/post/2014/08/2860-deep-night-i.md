Many people say that the Olympus 75/1.8, although it produces gorgeous bokeh and shallow DOF, has an awkward working distance.

It doesn't. Actually I think there is not even such a thing as a "good" or "bad" working distance at all. There are just focal lengths that get used more often and others that don't. It always takes me a few moments and sometimes even hours to adapt to a new lens, to see the way the lens sees, to adapt my implied inner frame to the lens' angle of view, but once it happens, it all gets very natural again.

The Song of the Day is "Deep Night" by Frank Sinatra. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Il8qO9OnfA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
