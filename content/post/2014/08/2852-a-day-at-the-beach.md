It's interesting: I had expected to get drawn into the shallow DOF game again by this lens, but that is not at all what has happened. Instead I enjoy the different angle, the sharpness, the fresh view. 

It may be that this is only for a while, but it may as well be that all that time since I changed from the Nikon DSLR to smaller cameras has made me more conscious of framing. Of course the Panasonic LX5 didn't have much to offer in terms of shallow DOF, and of course extremely shallow DOF isn't your first association when you think of Micro Four thirds either. This lens certainly has it, but I tend to not use it that way.
