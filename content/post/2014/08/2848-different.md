I follow many Micro Four Thirds photographers on Flickr, and most of them seem to like the Olympus 75/1.8 a lot. I can't blame them, it's a marvelous lens that I should use much more often. And so I do now ðŸ™‚

Being back to a prime and especially such a long one feels, well, different. It took me some time to get the feeling for the angle of view again, and of course this lens does some tricks that my zooms don't do so well. One of them is compression, the other is shallow depth of field. Here you have both.
