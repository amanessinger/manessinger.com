This is a true oldtimer, a scooter made in Austria by Puch in Graz. Today the brand still exists and you can buy <a href="http://www.puch-bike.at/home" target="_blank">Puch bicycles</a>, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class was sold under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_G-Class" target="_blank">Puch G</a> in some markets, and there is still a company under that name producing <a href="http://www.puch.at/?LNG=en" target="_blank">vehicles for the military</a>. I'm pretty sure though, there are no scooters any more.

By the way, I've taken two images of this scooter, this one at f1.8 and another exposure at f5.6. Shallow DOF won. There was a tiny amount of purple fringing around the extreme out-of-focus highlights, but the soft bokeh in the background gave me much better separation. It's kind of a portrait after all ðŸ˜„
