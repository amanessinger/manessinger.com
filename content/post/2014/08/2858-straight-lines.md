I've taken this image late at night, after midnight. It is a view into the glass and steel housing of a lift at the Underground station. No contrast, sick reflections of bad neon light, there was really no sound option but going black and white, but in the end I really like the result.

Actually that's one of the big advantages of black and white: you can process the image in ways that wouldn't be possible in color. Whenever you do local contrast adjustments in color, for instance to compensate for contrast lost in reflections, your colors do wild things. Yes, I know, I could do it in Photoshop and in LAB mode, but then, I've used LAB long enough to know that it also has its limits. Sometimes there is simply no value in keeping colors. Anyway, that's at least what I thought and decided this time ðŸ™‚
