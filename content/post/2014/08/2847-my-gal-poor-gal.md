Kazuuu, my poor little kitten was finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutering#Females_.28spaying.29" target="_blank">neutered</a> after a year. Ovaries and uterus were removed. That's a pretty invasive operation and for the wound to properly heal, it is important to prevent her from licking it or tearing apart the suture. That's what the hat is for. Believe me, she was not amused at all.

The Song of the Day is "My Gal (Poor Gal)" by The Lovin' Spoonful. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy-kkfs2R-E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
