Sometimes I enjoy symmetry. I didn't when I began photography, but the longer I do it, the more symmetry fascinates me, and especially so when it is somehow broken, for instance like in the asymmetric texture of the water.

The Song of the Day is "When My Ship Comes In" by Stiltskin. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9ZpFxJAEpE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
