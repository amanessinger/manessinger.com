A few days ago I wanted to go swimming in Vienna, but when I arrived in my favorite bath, GÃ¤nsehÃ¤ufel, an island in a backwater of river Danube, rain was imminent.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140715_181555_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140715_181555_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> And so it fell. The island GÃ¤nsehÃ¤ufel is basically a big park full of cottonwood trees and I can remember at least one incident during the last years, when smeone came to death during a thunderstorm, slain by a falling branch.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140715_190650_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140715_190650_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the other hand, it decidedly looked like a storm passing to the north, and therefore I waited in a restaurant, along with some parents who had failed to leave with their children in time.

Rain subsided, I swam for a few minutes and the day was a full success ðŸ™‚

The Song of the day, "A Little Rain" from Tom Waits' album "Bone Machine" has already been used in "<a href="/2009/10/1098-a-little-rain.html" target="_blank">1098 â€“ A Little Rain</a>", but that's been almost five years ago. I guess it is OK to re-use it today ðŸ™‚
