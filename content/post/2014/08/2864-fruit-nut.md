Today I have a window of a Turkish shop here in Vienna. Once a week I pass by, but actually I am always in a hurry and never have been inside. Really, could they be any more inviting?

The Song of the Day is "Fruit Nut" from the incredibly good XTC album "Apple Venus Volume 1". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVJ6ZVSQJwM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
