This is Kazuuuu, our charming little kitten. She was born in June and I guess she must believe the world is continuously changing for worse. Oh yes, that's the snow that I spoke about. Kazuuuu tried to climb up but made nothing but a hole. Too much snow for a small cat ðŸ™‚

I like the shape of the hole though. It looks like the silhouette of a rabbit, doesn't it? I call it the Rabbit Hole!

 The Song of the Day is "The Rabbit Hole" from Khaled's 2010 album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUkFO2h25eM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
