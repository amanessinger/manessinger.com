Funny. I wanted to write that I knew Ali Farka Touré only from his one collaboration album with Ry Cooder, but that's wrong. I have two albums, the other one is "In The Heart Of The Moon", also with Toumani Diabaté. I've forgotten.

 How did I remember? For this image I've searched Spotify for a song with the unlikely title "56" - and found it!

The Song of the Day is "56" from the 2010 album "Ali &amp; Toumani". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKumZ5ptXFE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
