I still don't have my new Olympus 25/1.8. Amazon already has the black one, but because most of my other Olympus lenses are silver, I wanted this one in silver as well. Still, I guess it will be in Villach when I return from Vienna next Wednesday.

 This image has been taken on the day the snow came. Actually in Vienna it didn't have much of an impact. It looked nice on the cars in early evening light though.

The Song of the Day is "Freshly Fallen Snow" from the 2013 Holy Innocents album "Letter to Lone Ridge". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0B5NpY2UnE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
