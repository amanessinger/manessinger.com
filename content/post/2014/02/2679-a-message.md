Remember that idea of mine for how to save my music listening history for future generations? Well, I've spent the whole weekend with that. In the end it will yield an open source project and maybe kind of a tutorial detailing the process, but it's still a long way there and I don't entirely know yet what my goals are ðŸ™‚

 In any case I'll use a bunch of current technologies like <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>, <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> and maybe a bunch of things that I've already forgotten ðŸ˜„

I'll use all that to scrape my playing history off Last.FM, put it in a database and make that data mine again, viewable and safe. All that will run on my new Linux home server.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/coldplay/a_message.html" target="_blank">A Message</a>" from the 2005 Coldplay album "X &amp; Y". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo9bU9zrfVc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
