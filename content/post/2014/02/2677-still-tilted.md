There were times when I really cultivated the tilt as my signature, but those days are over. Sometimes it works though.

 In this case it needed not only a tilt but also a pretty drastic conversion to B&amp;W. You see, I am no B&amp;W shooter, I mostly use it as an afterthought ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Still Tilted" from the 2013 Leaf Park album "Krill &amp; Money". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6yINFBkDJs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Certainly not my music, I never would have bought it, but on Spotify it at least made it in my "Incoming" playlist folder. I suppose it won't be promoted to "Keepers", but who knows ðŸ™‚
