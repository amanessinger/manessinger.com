It's snowing outside while I write this, and again the Image of the Day is not new. It has been taken on February 3, when freezing rains surprised Vienna. I like how this ice-covered car looks, but I'm certainly glad I didn't have to use it ðŸ˜„

 "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kings_of_convenience/surprise_ice.html" target="_blank">Surprise Ice</a>" is a track from Kings Of Convenience' 2004 album "Riot On An Empty Street". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITxxwISFAOY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

By the way, there is a great photo on the cover image.

I have no idea who the photographer is, but he certainly knows how to fill a square ðŸ™‚
