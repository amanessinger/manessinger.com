Here's the post for yesterday. I was slightly incapacitated after shoveling 450 square feet of snow, three feet high, from our roof terrace. Btw, I am metric all through, but in some cases feet sound much more impressive ðŸ˜„

 This is an image that I made in Vienna when I left work. It's just a busy street and ugly old architecture, but can you see it? Old advertising painted on the walls, new advertising, electrically lit, mounted all over the building. Layers of usage.

The Song of the Day is "Don't You See How This World Made A Change" by Blind Willie McTell. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq1MVSLUbW0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
