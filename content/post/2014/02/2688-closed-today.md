Amazon have changed their ad format. What yesterday was an IFRAME, today is a SCRIPT fetching a widget. The disadvantage is, that I can't position it floating left or right of the text.

Well, I used Amazon ads to point my readers to an easy way to buy the music that I write about. They did not make me money anyway, and if Amazon insists on destroying my layout, I can't help parting with them ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Closed Today" from the 1999 Naked Lunch (a band from my home town Klagenfurt!) album "Love Junkies". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0dMlOuQzU8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
