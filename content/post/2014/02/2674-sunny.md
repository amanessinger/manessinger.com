Yesterday morning I was in Vienna. It was a bright morning with blinding sunlight and a deep blue sky. It felt almost surreal after Carinthia's snow and rain. In reality it was not the warmth of a spring day, but the contrast made me feel it like that.

 I knew the Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bobby_hebb/sunny.html" target="_blank">Sunny</a>", but only the Boney&nbsp;M version. I had no idea that this is really an old Soul standard. Hear Bobby Hebb with the original version of his song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubvYQxTXO3U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
