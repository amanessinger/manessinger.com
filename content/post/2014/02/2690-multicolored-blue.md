This photoblog is in its eighth year now, and if taking an image per day (OK, it's more like publishing an image per day lately) has had any effect on me, then it is that I don't need to go in any shooting mode any more, don't need any warmup routine to begin seeing images. I just see them. Unconsciously. They are there to take and I take them. Just like this image of a car's tail lights. I guess you can tell that I like it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Multicolored Blue" from the Terell Stafford album "This Side of Strayhorn". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXQ9gfchYek">YouTube</a>.
