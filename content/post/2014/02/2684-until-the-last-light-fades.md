It's awkward at the moment. Most of the time weather is terrible. No light, rain or snow or fog or any combination of the four, and as a consequence I don't get out photographing. On the other hand, this gives me the opportunity to wade through past pictures and try to work on something that either escaped my attention or that I couldn't find the proper processing for.

 Today's image is from the latter category, taken on New Year's Day in the last fading light.

The Song of the Day is "Until The Last Light Fades" from the 2013 Mandolin Orange album "This Side Of Jordan". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyemgO9O2kU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
