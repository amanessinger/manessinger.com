I had almost given up on the concept of matching the title of my Image of the Day with a Song of the Day from my collection. It had started to get repetitive long ago. Yes, I have a lot of music. More than 3000 CDs and maybe around 500 albums bought as digital downloads, between 40,000 and 50,000 tracks. One would assume this should suffice for a blog like mine, but then: not all good song titles make for good image titles, and apart from that, of some songs I have countless versions. Jazz standards come to mind.

 Now on Spotify, with an almost limitless library, it is much easier. In this case I searched for "winter fields", and what I got was "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bat_for_lashes/winter_fields.html" target="_blank">Winter Fields</a>" by Bat For Lashes on her 2012 album "The Haunted Man". 

Did I know her? Hell, no. I can't know everything! Do I like it? Yup, I do! Would I have ever heard it were it not for my Song of the Day-ritual? Definitely not. Do I feel smug? You bet ðŸ˜„
