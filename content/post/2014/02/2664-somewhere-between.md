The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/willie_nelson/somewhere_between.html" target="_blank">Somewhere Between</a>", a duet by Willie Nelson and Loretta Lynn from the album "To All The Girls...". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kfRRD2xg1c">YouTube</a>.
