This is a bank. Probably not the one currently keeling over in Carinthia, but they're no less guilty, they were only less stupid. Corporate greed and unscrupulous politicians, my what a mix!

 The Song of the Day is "Keel Over" by Dutch band "<a href="http://www.jackieplease.com/" target="_blank">Jackie Please</a>", taken from their 2013 debut(?) Ep "Suck You All In". Great music, hear it on <a href="http://jackieplease.bandcamp.com/track/keel-over" target="_blank">bandcamp</a>.
