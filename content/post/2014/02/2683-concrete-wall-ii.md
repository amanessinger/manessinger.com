OK, here's one more image of the same wall, this time looking in the other direction, and this is a much stronger image. It took a fair amount of post-processing though.

 The Song of the Day is still "Concrete Wall" from Zee Avi's 2011 album Ghostbird, but the album that I link to is her self-titled 2009 album. Great music again. Hear for instance "Bitter Heart" on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpDXra9Zbk4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
