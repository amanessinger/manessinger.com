It feels odd to have parted with Amazon. A little bit like a lover lost. Or something like that ðŸ™‚

Anyway, here's a track from a collection of "royalty-free" music distributed by <a href="http://www.shockwave-sound.com/product/254.html" target="_blank">ShockwaveSound.com</a>. It is called "The Old Tower" and it's composed by BjÃ¸rn Lynne. You can hear it in full length, albeit overlayed with the acoustic equivalent of a watermark.

Wonder about the steep price of US$ 99.95 for a CD? Well, it's royalty-free music. You shell out this outrageously high price and then you can use it for whatever you like, for instance as a soundtrack for your US$ 100,000,000 Fantasy movie (shot with your Panasonic GH4, what else ðŸ˜„). In other words, this is not where you'd normally buy music. I for myself found it on Spotify.

Oh yes, Spotify. Today I payed my first 9.99â‚¬ for the next month of music. For a whole month I have not payed for a single music download. Instead I have enjoyed a free month of music, and as a consequence I have heard more music than ever and learned about new artists at a staggering rate. In other words: I enjoy it wildly ðŸ˜„
