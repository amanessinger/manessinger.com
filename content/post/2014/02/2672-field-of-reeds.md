No images today, here's one from early January instead. I've taken it in a park in Vienna. It was not particularly cold and neither was there snow. We used to talk of snow-less winters and the warmest January in ages. I guess, on average we're back to normal ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is the title song of the 2013 These New Puritans album "Field Of Reeds". In certain aspects it reminds me of the Incredible String Band, in others ... not at all. Anyway, interesting music. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI5z2mba0Wk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
