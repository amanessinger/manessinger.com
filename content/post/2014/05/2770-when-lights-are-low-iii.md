This image has been taken more than an hour before sunset. EXIF data says two hours, but that's only because like every year I forgot to change the camera to daylight saving time. I wonder how long it will take the camera industry to figure out that a camera today is actually a computer and that computers adapt to time switches automatically. Oh well!

I took the image while waiting for the train to Vienna. It had been pouring like mad an hour before and it was still raining. Lights were low and this is a situation where I immediately feel the drawback of the light weight of my latest acquisition, the Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-32mm 3.5-5.6 ASPH. At 12&nbsp;mm the maximum aperture is f3.5, but that quickly rises to beyond f5, and using such a slow lens at dusk or even at night feels odd for someone accustomed to using fast primes. But again, lenses always come with trade-offs. Sensor stabilization takes care of the problem for me, allowing me to hold effective 64&nbsp;mm at 1/4&nbsp;s. This is not an action shooter's lens, but for my purposes it is fine.
