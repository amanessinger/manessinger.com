For Croatia I re-packed my camera bag and used an all-zoom kit: Olympus 9-18 for wide-angle shots, Olympus 40-150/4.0-5.6 for some reach and of course the superb 12-40/2.8 used in this shot - for weight ðŸ™‚

Hmm ... really, on a sunny day with the DOF that I normally want, a minuscule Panasonic 12-32/3.5-5.6 would do just fine. 313 â‚¬ via Amazon.de. 229 â‚¬ sold used from a kit. Hmm ... Would I use it? On sunny days? Yup. In dark churches? Probably not. Hmmm ... still ... ðŸ™‚

And then there is the option to go ultra-heavy. This year, likely around Photokina, Olympus is expected to finally bring out a weather-sealed 40-150/2.8. It will be expensive and will weigh a ton, but it will make a damn fine companion for the 12-40/2.8. And then, next year, we will see the Olympus 7-14/2.8. Hmm ... equivalent focal lengths from 14-300 mm at f2.8, weather-sealed in professional quality ... I won't be able to resist that lure either.

And ... didn't I say recently that I have way too many lenses? I wonder what will happen ðŸ˜„
