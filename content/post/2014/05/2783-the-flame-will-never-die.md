Really, there's no lack of current images and I have rather too many than too few to use on the blog. Nevertheless sometimes I like to play around with old images like this one, taken in early January this year. Yeah, not really old, I know ðŸ™‚

Anyway, in this case I liked what I got and here it is. Could be everywhere, but I tell you, it's the small river Leitha near GÃ¶tzendorf in Lower Austria. There you have it ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "The Flame Will Never Die" by Beausoleil. Love that band, it always reminds me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092654/" target="_blank">The Big Easy</a>. Love that movie too. Hear the song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyvkxaGZrwI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
