Today I've got the cover of some electric installation, made from a certain kind of plastic that seems to deteriorate into fibers and looks kind of bearded. But then, this is Austria and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dCP-56Ps58" target="_blank">you just have to expect the unexpected beard</a> ðŸ™‚

Oh my, Austria as winner of the Eurovision Song Contest. That's the second time in my life, the first time was Udo JÃ¼rgens with "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQZZJIIt9tA" target="_blank">Merci ChÃ©rie</a>", but that was 1966 and I was only two years old.

I normally don't see television, but this Saturday by chance I saw the whole show. I rather liked the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWYdW9xik_U" target="_blank">country song form the Netherlands</a> that ended up in second place, but there was nothing wrong with our Conchita Wurst's performance. The song "Rise Like a Phoenix" was a well done James Bond song with a perfect light show right out of The Hunger Games. And that's fine as well ðŸ™‚

Anyway, the Song of the Day is "Flash" by Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan". <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKVX57DGV9U" target="_blank">We're back to Jazz</a> ðŸ˜„
