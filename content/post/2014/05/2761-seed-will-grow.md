I didn't arrange these pine cones but someone else did. This is in a large park in southern Vienna, Kurpark Oberlaa, forty years ago the stage of the second International Garden Exhibition in Vienna.

Today the park is tended but not exactly well-groomed. There is an area dedicated to allergenic plants, but the signboards are hardly readable and the plants long gone. There is a small farm, still with animals, but the attached inn is closed, the go-cart track is overgrown. That's OK for me and it may keep the park less crowded, even a little sleepy.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/ms_dynamite/seed_will_grow_feat_kymani_marley.html" target="_blank">Seed Will Grow</a>" from the Ms. Dynamite
 album "Little Deeper". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpl4FULKIBA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
