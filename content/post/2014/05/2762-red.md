Were these leaves really that red? I have no way to tell, but from experience I can say that some reds can't easily be taken pictures of. Backlit red foliage, that's one of those situations where it's almost impossible to reproduce nature's saturation.

Again this is an image that does fairly well on Flickr. This time it's easy to see why ðŸ™‚
