This is a very tiny picture, a close crop from an image taken with a much too wide lens. On the other hand, after I took the image, I tried to change lenses and, of course, in the meantime Kazuuu had recognized my attention and given up mischief in our roses. Thus I am happy with the tiny image that I've got, as opposed to the perfectly composed image with the right lens that I never had the opportunity to take ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Picture Of Innocence" from the Deep Purple album "Bananas". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAxq8SUKccs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
