This image was taken with the cheap 40-150 with the plastic mount. I really wish I had had the upcoming 40-150/2.8 available, because the background is distracting. On the other hand, shallow DOF would not only have blurred the background but also the machines in the back, and actually for the machines I have not enough DOF as it is.

OK, in Photoshop I could have invested a lot of time to get rid of the grass, or I could have gone B&amp;W, but that would have defeated the purpose completely. What remains is an image lacking. Sometimes I just accept it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Machines R Us" from the Faithless album "Outrospective". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27b3W84POXE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
