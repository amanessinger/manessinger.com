I took this image using one of my best and most expensive lenses, the Olympus 12-40/2.8, a fully professional lens with rock-solid build, excellent image quality, weather sealing and - a much too short focal length. 

Nevertheless, I took the image before changing to my cheapest lens, the perfectly appropriate Olympus 40-150/4.0-5.6, the one with the plastic mount. Needless to say that after I had changed lenses, the rooster decided to step down from the pig and the opportunity was gone. In the end I had to settle with a healthy crop ðŸ™‚
