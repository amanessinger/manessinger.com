Interesting. After "<a href="/2014/04/2744-success-ii.html" target="_blank">2744 â€“ Success II</a>" and "<a href="/2014/04/2750-the-fallen.html" target="_blank">2750 â€“ The Fallen</a>" it has happened again. Explored on Flickr. With 15,858 views in two days this is my so far most successful image on Flickr.

Am I delighted? Well, I can't say it feels bad, but of course the choice of images feels random to me, and essentially I think random it is. It's just the weird mechanics of social media.

Of course I try to analyze. Who wouldn't? The first image, the cola can on the similarly colored background, I think I can explain that. It is an image that looks both confusing and interesting as a thumbnail. It attracts you to look at it in a bigger size, and when you finally see it big enough to recognize what it is, it comes as sort of a surprise. I think people like that, at least I do.

#2, the fallen fence, is a fairly simple image with a twist. You may be attracted by the simplicity of the diagonal line, and the surprise, the added bonus that you get when you look at the full size, is the unexpected yellow stripe, the canola field at the top.

This image? I really don't know. I have used it because I had nothing better. The image is fairly complex and when it comes to balance and plain graphic quality, yesterday's image should do at least as well. Only that it didn't. It stands at 136 views at the moment, and though you can argue numbers, you can't argue a factor of 120 ðŸ™‚

So, again, why today's image, why not another one? Really, I don't know. I can only suspect that the big number of new followers since the cola can accident increased the chances of every image to rise. Which one does, which one does not, I simply can't predict it. And that's OK. It keeps me from even trying to produce what "reliably works".
