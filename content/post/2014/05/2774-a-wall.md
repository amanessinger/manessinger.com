I'm tired. I had a confusing and stressful day and this is the third attempt at writing a coherent post. Finally recognizing my condition, I'll refrain from philosophy and politics and instead keep it short: Here's a wall in Slovakia that for some reason attracted me and made me take an image ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bat_for_lashes/a_wall.html" target="_blank">A Wall</a>" from the Bat For Lashes album "The Haunted Man". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f9O8jW4GKY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
