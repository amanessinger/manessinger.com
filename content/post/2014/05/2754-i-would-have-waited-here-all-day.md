Unfortunately I had to go to work and so I had only a few moments to take a picture ðŸ™‚

This post is a few hours late. Sometimes life interferes with my schedule. Sorry for that.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lambchop/i_would_have_waited_here_all_day.html" target="_blank">I Would Have Waited Here All Day</a>" from the Lambchop album "Damaged". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBgHV6lPFrk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
