Actually this was more a test shot than an effort for an Image of the Day. I wanted to check how my new Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-32mm 3.5-5.6 ASPH performs with the sun in the frame.

In the end I converted the image to B&amp;W, because due to excessive overexposure, parts of the clouds had burned out, and that's a situation that is much easier handled in the absence of color. 

But really, how did the lens do? Right excellent, I'd say. There are no ghosts or flares in this image, and although you can easily provoke them with certain positions of the sun, this lens fares no worse than much more expensive lenses. You may not care about that, but for me, a notorious hunter for the sun, shooting into the light is a major application for every lens. You may remember that I sold the otherwise incredibly good Panasonic 7-14, simply because it suffered so much from ghosts.

The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/look_into_the_sun.html" target="_blank">Look Into The Sun</a>" from the 1969 (That year!) Jethro Tull album "Stand Up". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaEVY1YeKr4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
