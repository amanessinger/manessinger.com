This is an "explored" image again. Since the first time, the cola can in "<a href="/2014/04/2744-success-ii.html" target="_blank">2744 â€“ Success II</a>", I've had five images explored. While my total views in two years up to then had been a meager 110.000, the three weeks since have brought 50.000 views and a substantial number of followers. 

Sometimes I understand why exactly one specific image soars, sometimes I don't at all. This one at first didn't start off strong and that quite perplexed me. For all that I knew, it had characteristics that should attract viewers. Well, the next morning I knew that I didn't have to ditch my theory ðŸ˜„
