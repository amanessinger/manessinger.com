A few days ago I bought a new lens, the Panasonic Lumix G Vario 12-32mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH. Quite a name, huh?

This is the lens that Panasonic released as kit lens for its minuscule <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/panasonic-gm1/panasonic-gm1A.HTM" target="_blank">Lumix GM1</a> camera, and my motivation for buying it was to come up with an ultra-light zoom kit of three lenses, the 9-18, 12-32 and 40-150. These three lenses together cover an equivalent focal range from 18-300&nbsp;mm, and all three together weigh just 415&nbsp;g. Isn't that incredible?

So, how is that lens? Well, everybody says it's <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2014/01/15/panasonic-12-32mm-lens-review-the-gm1s-tiny-kit-lens-is-small-on-size" target="_blank">just fine</a> and I can only agree. Of course it's a compromise, but if I need more speed or even higher image quality, but am ready to accept the weight, I can always use the heavy (for MFT) and stellar 12-40/2.8 PRO. If on the other hand I can live without the convenience of a zoom and without the ultimate wide and long ends, my set of fast Olympus primes is the way to go.

As always when I have a new lens, expect me to use it exclusively for a few days.
