Fifteen minutes from work I am at a stagnant branch of river Danube. In summer this is a great place for swimming, in cold winters it is a skating paradise, and throughout the year there are some popular restaurants to enjoy.

The Song of the Day is "The Next Big River", one more time by Harry Belafonte. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvlfdNsTHaQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
