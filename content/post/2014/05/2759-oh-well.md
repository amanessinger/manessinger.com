This image has been taken with the big and heavy Olympus 12-40/2.8 PRO. It's a stellar lens, but recently in Croatia I wouldn't have needed it. Granted, the zoom kit that I had with me was not heavy at all, but using the Panasonic 12-32/3.5-5.6 on a sunny day (for instance for photos like this one, taken at f5.6) would instantly reduce total weight (three zoom lenses plus camera) from 1.22 kg to 0.91 kg. Substantial? Maybe, maybe not. We'll see soon, because I've just accepted the offer for an unused 12-32 from a GM1 kit.

The Song of the Day is "Oh Well" from the 1969 Fleetwood Mac album "Then Play On". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8RhZDGLEXM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

By the way, if all music were about to vanish except that released in a single year, and if I had to choose the year, <a href="http://rateyourmusic.com/charts/top/album/1969" target="_blank">1969 would be my choice</a>.
