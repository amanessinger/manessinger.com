Over the next few days you will see a series of pictures taken on a recent short trip to Slovakia. So far none of them was particularly successful on Flickr and maybe they induce nothing but a shrug in you as well, but that is not the point why I take them.

So, what is the point? Actually I don't take these images to have them seen and acclaimed by as many people as possible. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy success (whatever that is) as much as everyone else, but I don't need it to sustain my image making. That happens due to an inner necessity. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140512_120941_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140512_120941_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Truth is, I don't make images for you and I don't even make them for me. I don't print and hang them, I don't sell them, the most use I get out of them is as the odd wallpaper on my devices. I make images for no one.

I make images because I can and because the act of making images is utterly enjoyable. 

It's the process, not the result. Does that sound odd? Time wasted? Think twice. Living is a process and death is at the end. We live our lives because living is enjoyable and certainly better than not. Thus, even if that were the only example of a process being more interesting and important than its result (hint: it's not), I guess it's a pretty convincing one ðŸ™‚
