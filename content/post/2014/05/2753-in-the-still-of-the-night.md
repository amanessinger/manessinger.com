I took this image when I arrived in Vienna. Why? I really don't know. There was some kind of quiet peace in the arrangement of the two trees and the house. It also reminded me of night scenes by RenÃ© Magritte, though Magritte would probably have used a day sky for that night scene ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "In The Still Of The Night" by teh Neville Brothers. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5uxtGkR67s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
