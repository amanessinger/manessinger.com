It takes me two and a half hours to make such an image. Plus a tank of gasoline and the road tax through Slovenia. I don't drive down to Croatia more often than a few times per year, but whenever I do, it is a pleasure. Of course this image could have been taken on every sea shore, but still, I really think it smells of Croatia ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Beyond The Sea" by the incredibly talented Robbie Williams. See him live at the Royal Albert Hall on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrxgqhrNnXg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
