This image was taken in the parking area on the roof of Villach's biggest shopping center. That's where I went for inspiration on an uninspiring day.

By the way, this is my first post written on a quad-core Macbook Pro Retina, 15 inch, 2.5 GHz, 16 GB memory, 512 GB SSD. Feels a lot faster than the the five year old VAIO that I <a href="/2009/06/970-im-so-free.html" target="_blank">bought in 2009</a>.

By the way, what finally made me switch was not Lightroom or anything photo related. It was programming in Scala. IntelliJ IDEA plus Scala plus a few browser windows, that totally drove the old computer into overload and me nuts. I already had upgraded to 8 GB memory years ago and more was not possible. I suppose I could have just put a big SSD into the old one, and the paging would have been bearable, but then, the hardware was falling apart anyway and as I wrote then, "one day Iâ€™ll buy a Mac". Well, that day was Monday ðŸ™‚ 

The Song of the Day is "Hither, This Way, This Way Bend" from Purcell's "King Arthur". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Sa_tmXGfY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
