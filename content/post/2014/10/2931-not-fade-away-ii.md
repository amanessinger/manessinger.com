Autumn is a time for melancholy, especially when it's foggy in the morning. As I've already said, there is no reason to complain about this October. It's one of the most beautiful in recent years, as if the world would apologize for the ruined August ðŸ™‚

Still, there is a reason why "fall" is another word for this time of the year. Here are some fallen leaves to match the mood.

The Song of the Day is one more time the Rolling Stones song "Not Fade Away". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shQQuLULa7U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
