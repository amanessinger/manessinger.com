These tools were mounted behind the cabin of a pickup that I've excluded. Along with the waning light, I had a strong feeling of "Last Days of Summer" ðŸ™‚

Apropos tools, my OM-D E-M1 is now officially sent in for repair. It may take two weeks until I get it back.

The Song of the Day is "Tools Of The Trade" by Charlie Worsham. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLI2CrksIO0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
