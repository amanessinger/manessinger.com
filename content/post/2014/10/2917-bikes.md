I've taken images of lots and lots of bicycle for years. Most people assumed I have a special love for bicycles, and although I used to ride one for a long time and quite excessively, this is not really true.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140915_173152_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140915_173152_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I don't care so much about bicycles, I care about lines and simple shapes. Bicycles just consist of those and that makes them interesting.

Well, you know, since I've moved from Vienna's center, bikes have ceased to be prominent in my photography. I live in car land now. Nevertheless, sometimes we still meet ðŸ˜„
