Somehow this image triggers the same associations in me as "<a href="/2014/09/2904-the-fortress.html" target="_blank">2904 - The Fortress</a>", so here we go with the same title one more time. Incidentally the image was also taken at a shopping center, but don't worry, it's only a matter of perspective, normally our shops don't look so literally exclusive ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is one more time "The Fortress" by Jackson Dyer. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBKh3hV8yDM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
