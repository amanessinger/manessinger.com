We had some very warm and sunny autumn days here in Austria. After this cold and rainy August it was a welcome change. I know, bright sunlight is not what is usually considered the best weather for taking photographs, but it does warm the heart ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Pillars" by Pompeii. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTrDRQkCop4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
