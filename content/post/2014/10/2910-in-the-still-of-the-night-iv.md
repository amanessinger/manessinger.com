When I arrive in Vienna, I first change to a local railway train and later to the Underground. At that time, after midnight, the interval of the Underground is ten minutes and the coordination between railway and Underground is absolutely perfect. I always and unfailingly just miss the Underground ðŸ™‚

Well, on the other hand, I love it how empty the stations are at that time, and ten minutes are always enough to find some fresh view.

The Song of the Day is "In The Still Of The Night" by The Four Tops. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4T9yCdo72s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
