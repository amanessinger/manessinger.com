Recently I left work early and took the train down to Zentralfriedhof, Vienna's gigantic central cemetery. I go there a few times a year, frequently in winter, and most of the time I keep to the Jewish part.

This time I went for the graves of the rich of the Fin de Si√®cle. You see, money can buy a lot, even for the dead, but nothing is for eternity. After a hundred years you see decay everywhere, but somehow that's only fitting for a cemetery, isn't it?

The Song of the Day is "Last Call For An Angel" by Viktor Lazlo. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0ZdrTQyqIk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
