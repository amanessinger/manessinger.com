Today's images were taken on the same day, both with the Olympus 17/1.8 and for some reason I've converted both to black and white. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20141006_000249_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20141006_000249_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image to the right is the one Underground station that you see so often, mostly because after arriving in Vienna after midnight, it is the first place where I have to wait a few minutes.

The other image is the view up the facade of the office building where I work now.

The Song of the Day is "Aim High" by Paul Weller. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVy3m9OWkHs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
