This elaborate building was erected to celebrate the 50<sup>th</sup> year in the reign of "<a href="/2014/09/2890-the-emperor.html" target="_blank">The Emperor</a>". And this is only one building. In Klagenfurt, my home town, it was a theater, and in the same way it happened all through his empire. And to make it even more absurd, I suppose most of these buildings he didn't even visit once. 

Oh, by the way, this image has been taken with my old Panasonic LX5 while the Olympus OM-D E-M1 was sent in for repair.

The Song of the Day is "Jubilee Swing" by Ella Fitzgerald and her Orchestra. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBqCPjnmcfg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
