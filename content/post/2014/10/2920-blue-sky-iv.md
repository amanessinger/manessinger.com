By the way, in my rant about how awkward the D300 felt, I completely forgot to mention image stabilization ðŸ™‚

In this particular image I seem to have forgotten to use it though. 9mm, f5.6, ISO 400 and 1/60s: oh dear, I'd have gotten away with ISO 100 and 1/15s! I suppose it must have been because shutter speed was on the unresponsive back dial and I was fed up trying to change it ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is once again "Blue Sky" by Joan Baez. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZSLO80b0rc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
