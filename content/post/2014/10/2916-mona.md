Last light is the sweetest light, ain't it? Here's another detail from Vienna's center, again something that I typically see through a long lens once I's got accustomed to it.

"Mona" is a song from JJ Cale's classic album "5". I say "classic" because a classic it is, although I've never been a Cale man. JJ Cale somehow always flew under my radar, but I remember Eric Clapton saying, he wishes he were as good a musician as Cale was. Well, better late than never, right? Thus I hear JJ Cale on Spotify right now ðŸ™‚
