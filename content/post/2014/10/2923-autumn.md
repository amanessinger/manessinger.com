This is an image that I took the first day I got my camera back. I hadn't taken any images in four days but, wow, what a relief it was and how the joy returned!

The image is probably a tad over-processed, at least that was my impression while I did it, but I have to say that - honestly to my surprise - the final result looks pretty much like what I saw while I was there. Or at least that's what I think now ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Autumn" by Marc Almond. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icdO1QHHfbQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
