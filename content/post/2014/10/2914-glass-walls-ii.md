And here's another image taken on the same sunny day as yesterday's. This one is of a famous building right at the center of Vienna. It is called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haas_House" target="_blank">Haas Haus</a>" and was built by architect Hans Hollein right opposite of Stephansdom, Vienna's cathedral. You see reflections of the gothic facade in the not so totally flat glass.

The Song of the Day is still "Glass Walls" by Nik Ammar and you can still hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfRSaxaSkTI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
