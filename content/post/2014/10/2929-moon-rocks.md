Where these rocks are? No, not exactly on the moon, in fact they are at the base of the pillar shown in the last post, kind of a non-decorative decoration in a place where nobody sees it anyway. A filler for a gap in the architect's dream? I don't know, in any case I liked the light and thus I took the image.

"Moon Rocks" is a Song from the Talking Heads album "Speaking in Tongues". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_30A9fieqM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
