Days are still extremely short. A few days ago I decided to take images at a river shore near Villach, in a very photogenic place where I am often in winter. I arrived a little late though, and the shadows of the mountain range to the south had already reached the river bed.

 In the end I just took some images into the setting sun. This one had originally been in 16:9 aspect ratio, but since Lightroom 5.3 the aspect ratio chosen in-camera is not baked into the RAW any more, it's just a default. I mean, it's still nothing special, but this time re-framing after the fact definitely improved the image.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beck/end_of_the_day.html" target="_blank">End Of The Day</a>" from Beck's 2002 album "Sea Change". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHIUXZp6WGM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
