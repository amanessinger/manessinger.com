 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/clash/lightning_strikes_not_once_but_twice.html" target="_blank">Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice)</a>" from the 1980 Clash album "Sandinista!". To judge by the name, the album probably didn't make them many friends in the US. Probably didn't bother them at all ðŸ™‚
