Here's another image taken in a shopping mall in Vienna: water running down a decorative mirror. The image was taken from the first floor down, focusing on a cross of the gaps between the mirror panels. 

 The Song of the Day is "The Water's Edge" by K.D. Lang And The Siss Boom Bang from the 2011 album "Sing It Loud". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00_pT-OmyXc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
