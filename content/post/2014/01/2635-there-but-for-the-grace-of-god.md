Today's images were taken in Kamering, a small village in central Carinthia, the place where famous Carinthian author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Winkler_%28writer%29" target="_blank">Josef Winkler</a> was born. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140101_111013_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140101_111013_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Many of his books are about the traumatic experiences of his childhood in a small, rural community, about bigotry in a narrow-minded patriarchic society.

Winkler seems to be both fascinated and disgusted by religion, and for sure his mission has never been to make only friends ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "There But For The Grace Of God" from Mighty Mo Rodgers' album "Redneck Blues". If you're interested in his music (hint: you should!), you can also buy from <a href="http://mightymorodgers.com/cd-3-store.html" target="_blank">his own site</a>. CDs are more expensive there, but you get a signed one, a photograph and a T-shirt as well.
