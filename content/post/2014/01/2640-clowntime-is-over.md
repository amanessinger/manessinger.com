This park was created 40 years ago as the Vienna International Garden Exhibition. I suppose the clown sculpture near one of the entrances is also that old and, honestly, it looks like that.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/clowntime_is_over_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Clowntime Is Over</a>" from Elvis Costello's 1980 album "Get Happy". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=licLyL8OETk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
