I'm hearing Holly Golightly right now. While looking up the lyrics of the Song of the Day, I found that there is also an interpretation by Holly. This dragged me over to Amazon and made me put two of her CDs into my shopping cart. One other CD already waited there for enough company to get free shipping. You know, that's one of the exceptions when I buy plastic: the CDs plus MP3s cost about the same as the MP3s alone. 

I still haven't submitted the order though.

I recently got myself a Spotify account. Going to Spotify I found that I can have the same music for free. Well, Spotify plays ads in between, but when I want to get rid of the ads, I can just shell out 10â‚¬ per month and that's that. I even get offline playback and a higher quality  as well. Why should I submit the order to Amazon? Really?

Well, from a financial point of view I simply can't rectify shopping for music. Streaming via Spotify (and I really mean the non-free version) or Google Play (or whatever runs on your devices and in your country) is much cheaper.

I've already bought music for 31â‚¬ this month, hitting submit on my order will bring me to 60â‚¬ just for January. When I consider how much music I hear, this is insane. The amount for January would buy me a practically infinite amount of music for the next six months.

Should I submit the order anyway? Would you? Is there a benefit to owning music? What does it mean to you to own music? 

 Both images of today were taken in Friuli, Italy. The second image is not a stitched panorama, but just a strongly cropped single exposure. With a size of 4696&nbsp;x&nbsp;1457 it's still larger than the biggest monitor you can buy ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/getting_mighty_crowded_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Getting Mighty Crowded</a>" from Elvis Costello's 1980 collection of mostly B-sides "Taking Liberties".
