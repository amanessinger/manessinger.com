I did buy the 20/1.7 yesterday, but before you see the first images taken with it, I just have to use a few more taken with the 12-40/2.8.

This was everybody's Camera of the Year last year, and now an amount of 480â‚¬ was all I got after continuously lowering the price for a month. Seemingly the E-M1 is a big success, but unfortunately especially among E-M5 owners ðŸ˜„

Anyway, I'm sure the new owner will like the camera, just as I did.
