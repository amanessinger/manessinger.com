It's a new year. It will be a good year ðŸ™‚

Apart from that, do I have any resolutions? Predictions?

Not really. I can't imagine buying a new camera, but then, last year I had everybody's Camera of the Year, the OM-D E-M5, and I couldn't imagine either. Now I have everybody's Camera of the Year, the OM-D E-M1, and ever again wanting another camera is something that I can't imagine. But, you know ... ðŸ˜„

I've been using the 12-40/2.8 PRO for little over a month now, and I admit the only occasion when I've put another lens on my camera, was when I had to take a portrait. I used the 75/1.8 for that, and then I immediately switched back to the zoom. An impressive lens, one to love madly, but I still won't sell my primes.

To the contrary: I will buy a new prime. It will either be the once again rumored Olympus 25/1.8 (supposedly the kit lens for the upcoming OM-D E-M10, thus maybe due in February) or I will one more time buy the Panasonic 25/1,4.

 Crazy, huh? I had the 25/1.4 and sold it. Why should I buy it again? Well, I miss it, I shouldn't have sold it and it is a hole in my prime array. But then, an Olympus that's twice as light, only slightly slower and has the build of the 17/1,8, that would be even better. In fact, when I sold the Panasonic in Summer, I expected the Olympus to come out in Autumn ðŸ˜›
