When I set out to take images on a foggy day in Villach, I knew I would just have to drive up Mount Dobratsch, and regardless of how high the top of the fog is, 1700 meters are always enough.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140112_152915_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140112_152915_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> But then, some bluish quality of light made me assume that the top of the fog couldn't be very high and even a hundred meters would probably suffice. So it was.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140112_153055_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140112_153055_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I drove to Sternberg, a church on a rock between Velden and Villach, and though it was only hardly out of the fog, it was enough to make my day.

Of course I was not alone. The bench in front of the church was full of people enjoying the warm sun. While I was there, I took several images of the constantly rising fog. Three of them are here. They are not that different, but it's really a sight that I can't get enough of, especially at this time of the year.
