I guess you know about my constant fascination with photographing directly into the sun. Yeah, I know, that's what you're supposed to not do, but really, I can't help it ðŸ™‚

The Panasonic 20/1.7 (the lens that I have been using almost exclusively for a week now) has kind of a split personality when it comes to shooting into the sun. On the one hand it is pretty resistant to flares and ghosts, but on the other hand it shows strong purple fringing along high-contrast peripheral edges. Twigs against a sky are the classic situation.

 In this case I could get rid of it in Lightroom fairly easy, in other cases the image suffers, sometimes badly. It's supposed to happen much less often on Panasonic cameras, but I guess their magic is essentially the same as what I do in Lightroom. It was enough of a nuisance to make me sell the lens once, it may drive me that way one more time ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Muddy River Of Loneliness" from the 1998 Midnight Choir album "Amsterdam Stranded". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8WQEPO7dm4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
