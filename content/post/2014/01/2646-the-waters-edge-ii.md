This image was taken pretty much at the same place and time as "<a href="/2014/01/2642-muddy-river-of-loneliness.html" target="_blank">2642 – Muddy River Of Loneliness</a>". 

And this lens? The Panasonic Lumix G 20/1.7 ASPH that I've been using for more than a week now? Keeper or not?

Well, it must go for a second time. I'll sell it for the bargain price that I bought it, plus shipping. It'll still be a bargain for the buyer.

Basically this is a fine lens. It fits better on the E-M1 than on the E-M5 or a PEN E-P2, it  is quite resistant to flaring and ghosting, it is sharp, small, light and it makes pleasing images.

On the other hand it focuses very, very slowly. On the E-P2 this didn't irritate me, the E-P2 was no speed wonder either. On the E-M5, before I sold this lens the first time, I was kinda used to it. Now it's irritating.

Purple fringing is worse than slow focusing. I am no action shooter, thus slow focusing only slightly spoils the fun, but purple fringing sometimes spoils the image. Lightroom gets rid of it decently most of the time, but there are cases when you can't help noticing it. That's a problem and you can't work around it.

For 145€? Why should I sell it? It's still a steal, regardless of its few flaws!

 Yes, it is, but then: it's not in any respect better than the 12-40/2.8. It is "faster", yes, but then it's slower in an important and irritating way. Its sharpness is great, but not greater. Vignetting is worse, fringing is much worse. For a fixed focal length I'd expect more, thus even though it is small and light, this 300€ lens, normally going for around 200€ used, is available from me for 145€ plus shipping.
