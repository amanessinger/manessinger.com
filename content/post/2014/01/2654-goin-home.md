I may have used this title a few times in the past, but I'm too lazy right now to find out how often.

This is the staircase at work, you see me leaving. Or rather you don't see me, but I'm leaving anyway. You just have to believe me, which is what you have to do with photography in any case ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/going_home.html" target="_blank">Goin' Home</a>" from the 1966 Rolling Stones album "Aftermath". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjfvbO0b6Fg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
