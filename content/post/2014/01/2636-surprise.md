Remember a few days ago that I wrote I'd probably buy the once sold Panasonic Leica DG SUMMILUX 25/1.4 ASPH anew?

Well, I didn't, but - surprise, surprise - I made the somewhat crazy move of buying the equally once sold Panasonic Lumix G 20/1.7 ASPH anew. A local electronic chain sold it off for 145â‚¬. It's the old version and the price was about 40% of what the new version costs. All tests conclude that old and new version are essentially the same. Currently the old version sells used for about 200â‚¬. See why I bought it?

On the E-M5 this lens always felt a little awkward. The E-M5 was slightly narrower than the E-M1, with less space between grip and lens barrel, and while this lens is light and short, it has a comparatively big diameter. In other words, there was not much space for my fingers and that was uncomfortable. Not so on the E-M1. But, of course, the lens still focuses slow as molasses ðŸ™‚

 I have no idea whether I'm gonna keep it or again sell it once the Olympus 25/1.8 (rumors now pretty much confirmed!) is available. In any case it was a bargain and it is guaranteed to either sell for at least what I paid, or to be worth its money if I decide to keep it.
