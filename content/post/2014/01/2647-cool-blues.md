Isn't this image cool? Way cool? Much too cool? ðŸ™‚

Yeah, it is, but interestingly enough it was boring until I intentionally used a much too low color temperature. Normally I don't do this. In a way I regard the effect to be below myself. You see, I can be snobbish. 

 Here it simply works for me, giving me the feeling of a cold winter day.

The Song of the Day is the Charlie Parker classic "Cool Blues". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1WKUDB49mM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
