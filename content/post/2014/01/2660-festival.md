There must have been some kind of festival in Pordenone. At least we saw a merry-go-round and someone selling balloons. Apart from that there was a small and rather bizarre demonstration of a neo-fascist party. Nobody seemed to care though ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Festival" from Francesco De Gregori's 1976 album "Bufalo Bill". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKHxmLYOeNo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
