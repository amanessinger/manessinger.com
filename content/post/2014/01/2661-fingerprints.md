Bloody fingerprints, that's what this wall in a cafÃ© in Pordenone reminds me of. Probably not the desired effect though ðŸ™‚

 "Death Of A Ladies' Man" is certainly not Leonard Cohen's favorite among his albums, but it has some songs that show him in a remarkably unfamiliar style. "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/fingerprints.html" target="_blank">Fingerprints</a>" is one of those songs. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG9zED01DuA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
