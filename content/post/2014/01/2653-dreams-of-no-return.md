This was the supermarket closest to my apartment in Vienna. It was replaced by a shiny re-incarnation a few hundred meters away. Now it waits for demolition, dreaming of its former glory.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/incredible_string_band/dreams_of_no_return.html" target="_blank">Dreams Of No Return</a>" from the 1974 Incredible String Band album "Hard Rope &amp; Silken Twine". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94A1Lj26ivo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
