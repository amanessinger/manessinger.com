Here are some more images from last sunny Sunday, taken at the cemetery of Sternberg, the church on a rock above the fog.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140112_151812_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140112_151812_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These are likely among my last pictures with the Panasonic Lumix G 20/1.7 ASPH. The new Olympus 25/1.8 is rumored to be presented on January, 29, first leaked pictures of the lens are online, and it seems to be a plastic lens, in build more like the 45/1.8 than the 17/1.8. Well, if it is comparable in quality, I will certainly buy it, and if it is not, there's always the Panaleica 25/1.4, waiting to be bought again ðŸ™‚

 In the meantime I don't care much. I'm back to the convenience of the 12-40/2.8 zoom, and apart from the fact that it is not as fast as the primes, it is second to none in quality.

The Song of the Day is "Double Cross" from Mary Coughlan's 1985 debut album "Tired &amp; Emotional". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU-XUeDDXE0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
