A few days ago I wrote about reasons to go B&amp;W. Well, here's another good example.

This image had some strong colors (the ad poster for the circus) and otherwise mostly pale ones. Contrasts were extremely uneven as well. This is an image that simply does not work in color at all.

 In B&amp;W I could use some violent local contrast changes of the type that breaks every color image. Not so here and I really like the result.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/richard_hawley/whos_gonna_shoe_your_pretty_little_feet.html" target="_blank">Who's Gonna Shoe Your Pretty Little Feet?</a>" from Richard Hawley's 2005 album "Coles Corner". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlGOZKuAWNc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
