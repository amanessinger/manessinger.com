I've taken this image before and I guess I will take it a few times more. It always happens when I return from Italy. That's the view from the highway before the valley closes in, and fortunately it is possible to pull over and stop the car. I love that gradient above the snowy mountains.

 The Song of the Day is "In The Cool Of The Evening" by the Nat King Cole Trio. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vd5dLk0B8E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
