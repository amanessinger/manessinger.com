The weather here is sub-par and the question should not be what lens I buy next, but instead whether I need a camera at all ðŸ™‚

Here is an image taken more than a week ago and immediately rejected. In fact I only kept it at all because it was the only image of that day and I like to have at least one image per day, regardless of how bad it is.

 In retrospect I think it is not so bad at all. Going to B&amp;W did it for me.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/part_of_the_machine.html" target="_blank">Part Of The Machine</a>" from the 1987 Jethro Tull album "Crest Of A Knave". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngP-jWKPCnQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
