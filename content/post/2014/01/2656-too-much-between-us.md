I have a weird kind of seeing. Well, I suppose that's what you get after taking images for so many years. Why I took exactly this image? Why I framed it exactly that way? I have no idea, but I know that when I went along that fence, the final image was right before my eyes.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/too_much_between_us.html" target="_blank">Too Much Between Us</a>" from the 1969 Procol Harum album "A Salty Dog". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TryShK9BM4c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
