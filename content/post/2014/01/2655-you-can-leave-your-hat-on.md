This image has been taken with a lowly <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcfz150" target="_blank">Panasonic DMC-FZ150</a>. It's a modest camera by today's standards. It pales against its successor, the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dmc-fz200" target="_blank">Panasonic DMC-FZ200</a>. Both cover an equivalent focal range of 25-600&nbsp;mm, both start at f2.8 on the wide end, but the FZ200 maintains a constant aperture throughout its range.

 Would this image have been any better if I had been able to leverage shallow DOF? I strongly doubt it ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/randy_newman/you_can_leave_your_hat_on.html" target="_blank">You Can Leave Your Hat On</a>", but neither Randy Newman's original nor the frequently heard version by Joe Cocker. Today it's Mary Coughlan on her 2002 album "Red Blues". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ8FBMV9Pz0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
