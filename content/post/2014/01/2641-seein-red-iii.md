Even on a cloudy winter day there's color to be found. You just have to look for it ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "Seein' Red" by Edmond Hall. I've already used it in "<a href="/2009/04/924-art-of-not-seein-red.html" target="_blank">924 â€“ The Art Of Not Seein' Red</a>" and in "<a href="/2010/11/1496-seein-red.html" target="_blank">1496 â€“ Seein' Red</a>", but at least that's long enough since, that you may have forgotten just as I did ðŸ™‚ 

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmIvTwK5nP0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
