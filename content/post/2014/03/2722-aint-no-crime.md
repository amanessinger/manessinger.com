What does it mean to take a photograph of a photograph that has been displayed in public?

This is a small crop from an advertising poster for the Cirque du Soleil show <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/kooza/default.aspx" target="_blank">Kooza</a>. Follow the link to see the original.

I believe I have created a work that's, although derivative, clearly distinct, a work that does not get its impact from any of the original work's main parameters. It's a small crop from a big picture, thus composition is obviously completely different, and if that were not enough, it's black and white, while the original is strongly based on its wild colors. What do you think? Crime or not?

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billy_joel/aint_no_crime.html" target="_blank">Ain't No Crime</a>" from the classic Billy Joel album "Piano Man". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccddnwWq-ZM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
