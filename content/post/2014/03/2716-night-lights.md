Today we have two images taken more than a week ago. I had just arrived in Vienna, the moon was full (you may remember <a href="/2014/03/2711-dust-n-bones.html" target="_blank">my inability to take an image of it</a>), and of course, right after leaving the Underground station, I began taking photographs.

I do this all the time and only a small part ever makes it to the blog or to Flickr.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140317_004026_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140317_004026_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The second image is from the door to my apartment down into the yard of the apartment complex where I live. As apartment complexes go, this is really one of the better. The roofs are interconnected with bridges, and if you take your time, you can spend half an hour making a round-trip.
