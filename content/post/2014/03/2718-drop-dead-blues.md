This image has been taken on the same day as yesterday's, five minutes later, in the light of the waning sun. The colors may not have been quite as saturated though ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/anya_marina/drop_dead_blues.html" target="_blank">Drop Dead Blues</a>" from Anya Marina's album "Slow &amp; Steady Seduction: Phase II". We've had her a few days ago with an interesting version of "Waters Of March". Hear today's song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH_hwJtSdjc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
