Vienna is a pretty nice city and where I live now, it is very near to the river. Even in winter it is possible to leave work and go down to the water for some last rays of sunlight. Naturally it is even better now. You'll see one more image of the series tomorrow.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/justin_nozuka/swan_in_the_water.html" target="_blank">Swan In The Water</a>" from Justin Nozuka's 2010 album "You I Wind Land and Sea". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMUmfcX275U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
