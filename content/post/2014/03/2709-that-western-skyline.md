As promised here is one more image from the new skyline along old river Danube. Won't look that impressive to most of you, but the tall building to the left is something like #8 in the list of the tallest buildings in Europe.

While I was there, a few minutes after I took this image, I saw two elderly gentlemen with heavy DSLRs on heavy tripods, L-brackets and spirit levels attached, and it really made me wonder ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "That Western Skyline" from the Dawes album "North Hills". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CRKGnTaF7A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
