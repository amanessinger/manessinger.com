OK, I already suspected it: "2692 – Waters Of March" should have been "2692 – Waters Of March IV". Today, just because the images cry for the title, I have one more.

<a target="_blank" href="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/13225775853_27a3a29b04_o_d.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140316_145812_lr_plain.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The Image of the Day and the panoramic (the link goes to the full size on Flickr) were taken in a fen on a flat mountain range south of Klagenfurt. Never before have I seen it fully submerged.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140316_152723_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140316_152723_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The final image is simply a meadow flooded by snowmelt. You can see a strip of snow along the upper edge.

The Song of the Day is again Jobim's  "Waters Of March". I'm still working through the many versions that I found three weeks ago. One example that's also on YouTube is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9OfLUN6UAg" target="_blank">Anya Marina</a> on her album "Slow and Steady Seduction: Phase II".
