Actually when I took this image it already was Spring, but I have nevertheless cheated - in a way. I have taken the image in the outdoor section of a gardener's shop in Villach.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/it_might_as_well_be_spring_lyrics.html" target="_blank">It Might As Well Be Spring</a>" from Stacey Kent's album "Dreamer In Concert". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UKRpEWT3CA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
