Photography-wise it's pretty desperate down here in Carinthia. Fog, dirty snow and rain, but not enough rain to wash away the snow. Therefore please let me give you another image taken last week, before sunset, when I was on my way down to the river to take yesterday's image.

The Song of the Day is "Before Sunset" by Cheryl Hodge, taken from her album "Original Article". See her perform live in a club on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcEwCT9H3RY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
