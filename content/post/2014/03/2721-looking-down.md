When taking images I often like to look up, but on occasion I like to look down as well.

Here we have an image of an Underground lift floor, taken as I arrived in Vienna, and another one of dirt below a tree, peculiarly arranged by the rain, taken as I was on my way back to Villach.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140324_162040_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140324_162040_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Both images have had their share of processing, for instance did I have to strongly enhance contrasts in the reflection, and the dirt looked much better with some vignetting.

The Song of the Day is "Looking Down" from the Flying Pickets album "Blue Money". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UxhObBQvLU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
