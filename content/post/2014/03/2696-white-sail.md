First day in Vienna after a weather-wise infernal weekend in Carinthia, what happens? High fog, clouds and light rain. Sometimes I think it's not the weather, it's me ðŸ™‚

Anyway. The sun sail over the terrace of the China restaurant in the backyard of our office building is already open, and as long as I avoid taking parts of the sky into the image, it could as well be spring.

"<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cowboy_junkies/white_sail.html" target="_blank">White Sail</a>" is a song from the 1993 Cowboy Junkies album "Pale Sun Crescent Moon". Thanks again <a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bill Birtch</a>, for pointing me in their direction.

Hear the song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OHAk0oNvec" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
