First World problems? Well, I've got three of them ðŸ™‚

The first problem is, I've got more images to post than days a week. Ok, I could do as other people do and just post more than one image per day. I've done it in the past and I do it today.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140313_171541_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140313_171541_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The second problem is, that I often find music on Spotify that I don't find on YouTube, and that makes it impossible for me to link to it. For this post I had a good song called "Slanted? Oh Yeah!!", but because I couldn't link to it, I've searched on and settled with "Oblique".

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140313_172624-2_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140313_172624-2_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Actually that's not entirely true. I could link directly to Spotify, and even without a premium account you could hear the songs - for free. The problem is, you'd at least need a Spotify account. Even worse, Spotify is available in only a few select countries, thus, if a song is not on YouTube, I don't play it.

The third problem? I have too much music in my inbox. Being able to choose the best title among millions of songs confronts me with so much new music, that I have trouble hearing all of it ðŸ™‚
