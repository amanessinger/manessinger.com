Cemeteries are melancholy places almost by definition, and when a cemetery is old and neglected like the immense Jewish part of Vienna's Zentralfriedhof, it is doubly so.

In this scene I loved the long perspective, the shadows of the trees, and without knowing I was extraordinarily lucky. Look at the <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/13041929083/sizes/o/" target="_blank">full size on Flickr</a>: There are two people in the far distance, exactly at the vanishing point, exactly in the right pose. I've tried a variant before and one after this shot, only a few seconds apart, but this is the only image with the two. I'm glad it was the best composition anyway ðŸ™‚
