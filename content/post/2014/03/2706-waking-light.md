We've just had a few beautiful days that I should have spent being out and around photographing. Instead I've spent some good time writing programs and a lot of not so good time talking about writing programs. Oh well!

Here's an early morning image. The shadow is of some fence post. Probably. Anyway, it caught my attention ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beck/waking_light.html" target="_blank">Waking Light</a>" from Beck's new album "Morning Phase". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ev5gip24SE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
