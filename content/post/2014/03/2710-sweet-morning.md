I've been using the Olympus 25/1.8 for a few days now, and although I have sold the Panaleica 25/1.4 and can't compare the two directly, the difference is nothing to get agitated about. If you have one or the other, there is no reason to change. Both are excellent lenses, and while the Panaleica is slightly faster, the Olympus is lighter and focuses slightly closer. A draw if there ever was one. Personally I love this lens. It feels perfectly familiar in my hands, just as if I had used it for years. That's how I like it.

This image has been taken in the morning in a side road in Vienna. Neat rows of small houses, a narrow onw-way street, no traffic, everything looking like in a toy village from the past. I wondered whether the cars are real or only dummies bolted to the ground. I didn't check though ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Sweet Morning" from the Tenfold Rabbits album "Travel The World". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87wKuDOito0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
