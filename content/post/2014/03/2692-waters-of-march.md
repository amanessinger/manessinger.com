The actual image was taken a few days ago but today is the first of March, so I guess using this title will be fine.

Now, streaming music, my workflow has completely changed. No longer am I restricted to what music I own (and sometimes I've bought music in order to use it on the blog), now I can choose freely from a much bigger collection, from Spotify's whole catalog.

Looking at the image and knowing the date, of course my first association was "Waters Of March". I own two versions of this Jobim classic, one by Holly Cole and one by Cassandra Wilson, and I am sure I have already used both of them more than once ðŸ™‚

Today I have heard 12 versions of this song that I didn't know before. One of them is by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wi-s8R9Gfc" target="_blank">David Byrne and Marisa Monte</a>, taken from the AIDS benefit album "Red, Hot + Rio". I like both artists, so this one was a given. The next one is a completely unusual and very dramatic rendition by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbGUaeEcuIk" target="_blank">Mina Agossi</a>, a singer from France with strong connections to Africa. Finally I have the charming duet between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZO3binphGI" target="_blank">Jamie Broza and his daughter Carmen</a>. There's more, but for now my "incoming" playlist folder on Spotify is full to the brim ðŸ˜„
