These images were taken last Saturday. It was the last day before the rain came. Sunday we even had some snow, but of course it didn't last.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140322_092915_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140322_092915_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The fence on these images is around Villach's humble soccer stadium, the blue plaque reads "Use of the site without exception only with express permission of the city of Villach". 

The Song of the Day is "Perimeter Probe" from the Nebular Spool album "Ruins". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvIO4SmAEdk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
