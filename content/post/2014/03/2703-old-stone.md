Times change and so do my problems. Can you remember my laments about always having to re-use songs? Well, since I am on Spotify, I don't have that problem any more. My new problem is, that I find new and interesting music at a faster rate than I can hear it ðŸ˜„

Therefore, instead of searching for something new, I just hear more of Laura Marling's album "Alas I Cannot Swim". Today it is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/laura_marling/old_stone.html" target="_blank">Old Stone</a>". Enjoy it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ofg1-HCD6wg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
