Two weeks ago I was again in my old hunting grounds, the seventh district, probably Vienna's most colorful, varied and interesting part, full of galleries ("<a href="http://www.westlicht.com/en/" target="_blank">Westlicht</a>" is here, a photography gallery with a strong <a href="http://www.westlicht-auction.com/index.php?id=3&L=1" target="_blank">auction business</a>), restaurants and shops of all sorts. I was there to buy something to hang between two windows and ended up with an old mirror from <a href="http://www.morton.at/" target="_blank">Morton's Art Palace</a>, likely my favorite furniture shop.

The actual image is the base of a shop window. Inside we see pink drapery and a price tag hanging from something we don't see. There's a blue wood panel on the wall below the window, and in the lower left corner we see pavement. This is my personal most favorite image from the last months.
