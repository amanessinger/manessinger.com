Yeah, really, how do I? This blog has been running without interruption since October 2006 and that's quite a long time. I don't know when, but it's been longer than half a year now, that I decided to make this blog less "daily", at least as far as I'm concerned. I write ahead and use WordPress' scheduling feature to make a post a day appear, normally at eight in the evening.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140531_161253_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140531_161253_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Only in a few cases I've had a post late in all that time, yesterday's accident was a rare exception.

And it works. I have decoupled taking photographs, processing them and using them in blog posts. I don't shoot much less than I used to, but I am more selective in what I use. I still may post the occasional complete dud, but at least at that time I don't recognize it ðŸ˜„

It's less real-time, it makes it harder to talk about current news and events, thereby making my content less interesting, but it is way easier to carry on that way.
