At the moment, while writing this and a couple of other posts, I am on my way from Carinthia back to Vienna. For another week I have brought my light zoom kit, consisting of the Panasonic 12-32 as my main lens, accompanied by the Olympus 9-18 and the very capable 40-150 with the plastic mount. Again I wonder when next I'll lust for the big, heavy and expensive 12-40/2.8. Maybe I should force myself to use it next week ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Reality And Fantasy" by the incredibly talented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Gualazzi" target="_blank">Raphael Gualazzi</a>, another artist I probably wouldn't have known without the convenience of trying new music on Spotify. Hear the song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxc4onRBSI8" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or - better - check out his albums "Reality And Fantasy" and "Happy Mistake". You won't regret it.
