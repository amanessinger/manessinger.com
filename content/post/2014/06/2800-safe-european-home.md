There is a fundamental difference between what we believe are our circumstances and what they really are. We do know about our deficits, but we compensate for them with hope. That's how the system works for those who have and that's why it is so stable. We always believe we just had bad luck or not the right opportunity. Not any old opportunity, no, the one that waits just for us. Our opportunity.

And instead of joining up for a revolution, we buy ourselves a ticket for the lottery.

Just one more time.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/clash/safe_european_home.html" target="_blank">Safe European Home</a>" from the Clash album "Give'em Enough Rope". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_6UTZb-_vI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
