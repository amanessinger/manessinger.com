One day too late. I hoped I would write a week's worth of blog posts during yesterday's commute from Vienna to Carinthia, but then the train was cancelled due to a storm in Germany and I decided to rent a car.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140529_145922_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140529_145922_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In the end I was one hour earlier in Villach than usual, but the more than three hours of driving had cost me all energy for the day and nothing got written ðŸ™‚

Here are the last two images from Sopron, two places to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvgN5gCuLac" target="_blank">your stuff</a> from, and if you don't need stuff, you can always go there for some color ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Stuff" from Miles Davis' album "Miles In The Sky". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jGSsNOhuUo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
