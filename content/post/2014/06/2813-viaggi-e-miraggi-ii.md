The former monastery of Santa Caterina del Sasso is one of the most famous sights of Lago Maggiore. It has been built into a steep cliff face and the normal way to approach it was by boat. Today there is a lift down from the top of the cliff and that's also the way we came.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140615_115936_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140615_115936_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The church is interesting, because due to the constraints of space it has a completely irregular floor plan. It was pretty dark inside, but that's where the OM-D E-M1 shines like no other camera that I've had before. The Image of the Day was taken at half a second, handheld, at ISO 200. 

The Song of the Day stays "Viaggi e Miraggi" by Francesco De Gregori. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2oH5tvaWfo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
