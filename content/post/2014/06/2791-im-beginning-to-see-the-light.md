<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopron" target="_blank">Sopron</a> is a city in Hungary just across the Austrian border. From Vienna by car it is not more than 45 minutes away, and still, it was only recently that I first visited it.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140529_140958_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140529_140958_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Having been destroyed by a catastrophic fire in 1676, the city was born again as a jewel of the Baroque age. After much neglect during the communist era, Sopron is becoming beautiful again and in fact so much so, that I was shocked. I just wasn't expecting anything like the layered structure of concentric, oval streets connected by countless passage ways and the incredibly beautiful walk along the old walls enclosing the historic center.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140529_144304_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140529_144304_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Sopron is one of those places that can't be confused with any other. It's crazy to have lived in its vicinity for 30 years and not to have known about its beauty. 

The Song of the Day is "I'm Beginning To See The Light" by Ella Fitzgerald. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bfW7cUtgXA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
