Carinthia is one of Austria's prime tourist destinations, and although there are higher mountains in Tyrol, at least as many lakes in Salzburg and much more culture almost everywhere, the mix is working outstandingly well.

We've got many of them and if you've ever asked yourself where they are kept while they are not needed, don't ask no more. Seltschach is the place and I was there ðŸ™‚
