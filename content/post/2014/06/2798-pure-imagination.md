Once we used to get rich on the basis of the things we produced, but now we've got a new thing. IP is the thing - Imaginary Property, as I like to call it. Just pretend you have invented something (buying with one click, making a product image using a white backdrop, sliding something to unlock) and pay politicians to make you laws that indefinitely secure your income. And don't forget to brainwash the 99% that it's in their interest. 

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lou_rawls/pure_imagination.html" target="_blank">Pure Imagination</a>" by Lou Rawls. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHz4KGnr4uA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
