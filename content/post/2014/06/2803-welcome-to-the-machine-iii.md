What could possibly be wrong with more snow cannons? This time we're looking right into them.

I've used the 12-40/2.8 PRO for these shots and while it's clearly the better lens than the tiny and light Panasonic 12-32, it's the opposite in any other regard. The lens is big and heavy, and I guess for my upcoming trip to northern Italy I'll happily take the 12-32. That's for that ðŸ™‚
