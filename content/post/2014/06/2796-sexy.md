Here's another image from the same walk through Villach as the two shown yesterday. I love the colors and I didn't want to stow it away among the B&amp;W images.

This is the window of some sex shop or peep show (or both?) and I like the contrast between the modern look of the font and the shabby decay of the surface.

The Song of the Day is "Sexy" from the Devil Doll album "The Return of Eve". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBWxgGAhP_8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
