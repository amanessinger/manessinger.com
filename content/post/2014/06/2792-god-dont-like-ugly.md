I'm not a religious man, to the contrary, the older I get, the more determined becomes my atheism, but that does not keep me from going into churches or, as rare as they are around here after Nazi barbarism, into synagogues.

The Image of the Day has been taken in the Old Synagogue, today a small museum. The other images are of two minor churches.

The Song of the Day is "God Don't Like Ugly" by Roberta Flack. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PShiC_Af-Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
