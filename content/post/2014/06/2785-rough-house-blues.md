I've been using the Panasonic 12-32 for quite some time now and I can still find no fault. <a href="http://www.photozone.de/m43/873_pana1232f3556" target="_blank">Photozone didn't like it</a> nearly as much as I do and their recommendation is to use the Olympus 12-40/2.8 PRO for anything serious, but as someone who owns both and has used both, sometimes in extremely dim light, I can say that the convenience of small size and low weight is not to be underestimated.

Yes, the Olympus is better, but for thrice the price and almost seven times the weight it really should be, shouldn't it? Is it so much better? Well, maybe for the few things that it can do and the Panasonic can't, yes, it's better, otherwise hardly ðŸ™‚
