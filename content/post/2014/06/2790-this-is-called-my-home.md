How about some color images for a change? I've taken this one in my apartment in Vienna. It is not what I recently have written about, not something created organically over a period of long years, but I still have spent plenty of time with the details in this one-room apartment. Colors were one important factor and the area near entrance is green with red Chinese furniture and a big gold framed mirror. I guess it's a photographically interesting place and I could show you more of it.

The Song of the Day is "This Is Called My Home" by We Are the Ocean. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dEAMbQqEFQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
