It was only a lamp in the garden of a nice restaurant in Villach. Actually the garden was much nicer than the food, but I won't complain. At least I ended up with an image.

<a href="http://www.bungalow104.com/" target="_blank">April</a> jokingly found it scary, and although that wouldn't have been my first association, I think I can relate to where it came from.

So now, here it is, the Song of the Day, "Love You Deadly" from the Nekromantix album "What Happens In Hell, Stays In Hell". If it just would ðŸ™‚

Hear the Song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XigoeKxWJb4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
