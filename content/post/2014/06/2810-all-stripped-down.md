You feel you've seen this fence with the torn posters one or two times before? You're right! Well, one has to work with what one has available ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "All Stripped Down" from Tom Waits' album "Bone Machine". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdRzunRwhE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
