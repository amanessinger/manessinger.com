By and large my new office building is well made. In the old office we have always suffered at the peak of summer, and I can't tell you how disappointed I was, when I heard, that the new building would be without air conditioning. 

The architect told us, the building would be built in a way that it would keep cool all by itself. Needless to say that I didn't believe a word - but it does. So, my biggest concern turned to be unfounded and I am absolutely happy.

On the other hand, if you look long enough, there is always something, isn't it? In this case it is what you're looking at. It's a connection between two parts of the office complex, shared by two departments. We call it the "Bridge" and it has a lot of smaller conference rooms. They have a peculiar wall pattern made of small, regular holes, spaced maybe one inch in between, completely regular, a raster pattern. Now, when you sit in a conference and look across the table, you have to be very careful to ignore the opposite wall. Fail to do so and you end up with something very similar to motion sickness. It's not only I either, almost everybody says that. That pattern makes you sick ðŸ™‚

Apart from that, well, when the sun shines in through the windows, you may get the bonus of the interference of the shadows of the grates with the pattern on the wall. It's crazy, but thankfully I don't have to spend much time there. The rest of the building has normal windows and normal walls ðŸ˜„
