Como, the city at the southern end of Lago di Como, has a large cathedral, one of the marvels of early Italian renaissance.

At least in my travel guide I found the same reference.

It did for a few minutes while we were inside, but as soon as we left, the rain was gone again and the sun came out. Quite welcome when you want to sit outside and have a drink ðŸ™‚
