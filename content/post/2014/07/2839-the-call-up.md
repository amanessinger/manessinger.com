My widest lens, the Olympus 9-18, is not wide enough. There was a light in the upper left corner that would have made a nice accent. I've tried to go all way down to the floor and include it, but then I lost the perfect angle on the stairs and I had to cut them without any viable option for the lower corners. Didn't work.

The Panasonic 7-14 that I sold last year would probably have been wide enough, and in this particular image, I would not even have had a problem with any lights in the frame ... unless of course I would have tried to include the light, that was the reason to wish for a wider lens in the first place ðŸ™‚

Olympus will have a 7-14/2.8 next year, I expect it to be free of the reflections that plague the Panasonic on Olympus bodies, but of course it will be large and heavy and expensive. Hmm ... nothing. Really ðŸ˜›

I guess the perfect lens for this image would have been my old Sigma 8-16, but that lens has gone as well. 

Reality is, I don't mind. Yes, once in a while I fail to make an image that I once would have easily made. On the other hand, guess how often I carried the Sigma 8-16 with me. Imagine how many images were not made because of that. And finally there are a lot of images that I am able to make, only <strong>because</strong> I have a wickedly stabilized camera with more depth of field than I once had. There are always two sides to a story ðŸ˜„
