Yesterday I said I'd close the chapter of my trip to the shores of the northern Italian lakes, but in the meantime I've processed this image. It was also taken on the closing day and it shows stairs leading down to the water of Lago Maggiore. So if you wonder what's that lake that you can't see in this image, Lago Maggiore is it ðŸ˜„

Twelve was such a nice, round number, I really had to choose another song. Here's "Post Scriptum" by Cristina Branco. Differently southern but southern as well. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qSbRiRiFK8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
