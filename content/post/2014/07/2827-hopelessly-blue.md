This is a house in Vienna's second district, once the center of Vienna's rich Jewish culture, today, well, just that, but on a much smaller scale. If you are in the business for kosher food, that's the place to go.

This house was reported to me as "The Russian House", and I don't know why. A Google search reveals that it has been sold recently as a luxurious city residence. Maybe it was sold to rich Russians, maybe the name dates back to the time of Russian occupation after WW2. I didn't ask and now Google won't tell me ðŸ™‚

In any case the image did quite well on Flickr, even got into Explore, although it only did so at the very end of the day and just rose above 1000 views that day, approximately double since.

The Song of the Day is "Hopelessly Blue" by Kat Edmonson. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12uCHi77gSs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
