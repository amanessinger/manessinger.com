Don't believe me? Just wait a little. All of them do. Babylon's walls did, Rome's walls did, Byzantium's did. They all do. In the long run, hiding behind walls is utterly pointless - but human. That's what we have to work on ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Walls Come Tumbling Down" from the Style Council album "Our Favourite Shop". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5HfOipwvts" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
