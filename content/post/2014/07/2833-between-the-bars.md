Same weekend as the last two posts, two more primes, 12/2.0 and 25/1.8, both used in a range where any lens would do. I didn't enjoy using those primes at all, but I also didn't want to give up so easily.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140706_114931_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140706_114931_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The weathered inscription on dark green background in the shop image reads "Weapons" on the left and "Fishing" on the right side, but I guess no animals were endangered by the shop's goods in a long time.

The Song of the Day is "Between The Bars" from Madeleine Peyroux' album "Careless Love". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyUv4k2wp0s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
