This image, taken in a church dimly lit through partly colored windows, had hopelessly weird colors. Going black and white elegantly took care of that.

It is also an image taken with a relatively expensive prime lens, the Olympus 12/2.0. Half a second handheld at f5.6. Dummy, you say, at that aperture you could as well have used your cheap Panasonic 12-32! Yup, correct. Or the expensive Olympus 12-40/2.8. Wouldn't have mattered either ðŸ™‚

I just wanted to play a little with primes again on that weekend. I did and ... found them somehow unrewarding. I found myself changing lenses all the time, obviously because using mostly zooms for almost half a year has fostered the habit of seeing focal length as variable. No wonder it was unsatisfying.

There were two ways I could go now. One was to go back to the zooms, the other was to force myself using primes. I know that this irritation normally goes away pretty soon, and then using primes, and mostly one prime all the time, makes me very creative. I decided to at least try it one more day and then decide.
