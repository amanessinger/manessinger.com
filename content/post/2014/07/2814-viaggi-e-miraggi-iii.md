The Image of the Day has been taken in Ispra, a small town on the east coast of Lago Maggiore, south of Laveno. The town is best known for housing the Institute for Environment and Sustainability, part of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. We only passed through and I didn't look for the institute, but what immediately caught my attention was this wall.

Somehow the streetlight and the top of the door look like a crown to my eyes. Add the extravagant color and you know why I call it the Queen's Club ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is still "Viaggi e Miraggi" by Francesco De Gregori. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2oH5tvaWfo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
