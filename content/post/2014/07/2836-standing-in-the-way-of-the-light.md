I don't really know why, but somehow I have less time for photography at the moment. This may be connected to stress at work, but it may also be simply due to the fact that I read a lot lately. I even have found pleasure in reading modern German literature. I haven't done that in a long time, maybe 90% of what I've read during the last 20 years was in English. Well, I won't run out of books either way ðŸ™‚

Here's another railway station image. I took it for the shadows and got the light as a bonus ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Standing In The Way Of The Light" from Birdy's 2013 second studio album "Fire Within". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biHfPEnFJRQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
