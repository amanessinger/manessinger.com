The street between Villach's main railway station and the main bridge across river Drau (and then on to the main square), is not exactly crowded but nevertheless enjoys a steady stream of pedestrians. It is marred though by a would-be construction site that has been waiting for years to become a shopping center. So far it didn't, and only the sketched crowd of happy shoppers on the canvas cover of the fence seems to believe in such a future. Meanwhile the canvas gets shabby and torn.

The Song of the Day is "Reasons For Waiting" from the Jethro Tull album "Stand Up". I have used it two times in the past, the last time 1829 days ago. That is a long time ðŸ˜„
