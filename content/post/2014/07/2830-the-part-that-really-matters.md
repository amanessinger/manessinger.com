When I took this image one morning a few weeks ago, I was on my way to see the doctor for a prescription. I used the car and I had passed that point pretty often by now, but at that time the light was absolutely magical. I had to stop the car and take an image.

At home, when looking at the image, all the magic was gone. The colors were flat, the shadows much too dark, the highlights already losing detail, it was a mess.

Days later I got back to the image because it was raining and I was bored. I tried a few things, completely altered the tonal distribution, changed color balance to bring out the reds, and suddenly, suddenly the magic came back. Suddenly I was able to see why I had taken the image in the first place.

This is not a matter of right or wrong. The camera may have recorded the image in a way that is more true to reality than my own version, but the part that really matters is, that I was there and what the camera recorded is not what I remember. What I remember is what I see now.

The Song of the Day is "The Part That Really Matters" from the Proclaimers album "This Is The Story". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87lcN1Ym1Fw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
