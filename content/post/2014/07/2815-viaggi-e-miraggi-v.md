Some places are beyond real. Isola Bella is one of them. This is one of the three Borromean Islands between Verbania and Stresa.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140616_163217_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140616_163217_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Basically the island is not much more than a palace and a garden, but what a palace this is, and the extravagance of the garden puts it high on the list of attractions you must have seen.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140616_144120_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140616_144120_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> We were lucky. Weather was fair, the sky was blue and only graced by a few scattered clouds.

The Image of the Day is one of the few that I made inside the palace, immediately before I was told that photography is forbidden. Well, sometimes it helps to ask whether a photo permit is available for some extra money, but in this case it was not. It's a little petty-minded given the steep price they asked at the entrance, but then, it's private property, unfortunately they can do as they want.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140616_105607_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140616_105607_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, the inside was not overly interesting anyway. Lots of people and most parts of the rooms not accessible, the furniture mindlessly arranged in a way that makes no sense at all, much of it covered under cheap looking plastic foil. I mean, yes, it's probably effective to prevent children from climbing into 400 year old beds, but even if the purpose is preservation, I have the feeling they could have done it in a more tasteful way.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140616_105702_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140616_105702_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Anyway, the most interesting part of the island is the park. There you have exotic plants, lemon trees with lemons bigger than you ever thought a lemon could be, fountains, white peacocks, rich sculptures in a lavish paradise garden, and everywhere you see the word from  the Borromeo family's coat of arms: Humilitas. Go figure ðŸ™‚

By the way, the last image shows the <a href="http://www.borromees.it/" target="_blank">Grand Hotel Des Iles Borromees</a>. This is where Hemingway stayed and, well, we didn't ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2oH5tvaWfo" target="_blank">Viaggi e Miraggi</a>" by Francesco De Gregori.
