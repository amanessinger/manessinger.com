Spring is great and life feels so easy now. This weekend I used a sunny Saturday for a short trip around Carinthia. The idea was to take images in two of our major churches, but in order to get there, I had to cross a lot of sun-drenched landscape. It was a pleasure ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Life Is So Easy Now" from Son of Dave's album "O2". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjk-mrOgUA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
