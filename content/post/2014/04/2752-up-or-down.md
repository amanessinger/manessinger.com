When I processed this image, I was puzzled. I strongly remembered that I had taken it looking down the stairs. But had I? This looks very much like looking upward, right? And indeed, that's the case. It's a different place, one that I had been in before taking the Underground, not afterwards. Sometimes even strong memories can be completely wrong ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Up Or Down" from the 2012 Quietdrive album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rnpyde61ZE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
