Well, sounds like bitterness but it ain't. I love to live round the corner from where I work, and when I want to go to town, you know, I always can. It's a short trip on the Underground when you do it for fun. It only gets a burden when you have to do it daily.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sid_vicious/something_else.html" target="_blank">Something Else</a>" by the Sex Pistols. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbP468JbCzI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
