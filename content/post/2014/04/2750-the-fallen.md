This is by the side of the road leading to our apartment complex in Villach. The fence fell victim to last winter's snow. By the way, this image also made it to Explore on Flickr. It didn't soar as high as the one in "<a href="/2014/04/2744-success-ii.html" target="_blank">2744 â€“ Success II</a>", but nevertheless, I take it as a sign that my number of followers has crossed a threshold. Ultimately it's pointless to think about it, but in a way it's interesting to see social media in action.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/franz_ferdinand/the_fallen_lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Fallen</a>" from the Franz Ferdinand album "You Could Have It So Much Better". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsXzLgPXlNE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
