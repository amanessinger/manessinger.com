While Carinthia had a meter of Snow in February (and in some places it's still around), Vienna didn't have much snow at all this year. Still, even if the winter was not hard, there is something magic in the coming of Spring. 

This is just a morning image without much of a subject. The image coming out of the camera completely failed to reproduce the warmth and radiance that I had seen and could remember, but I think putting it through careful post-processing I have come pretty near. By the way, this is Lightroom only. I can hardly use Photoshop any more ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Spring is Here" by John Coltrane. Really, why not instrumental this year? Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69MWVCFwvs0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
