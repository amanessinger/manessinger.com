This image was taken in the Franciscan church in Vienna. It was a little bit tricky to process because of high dynamic range and a completely different color temperature below the arc to the left. Actually I'm pretty proud of the result. Much better than reality ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/steve_harley_cockney_rebel/sebastian.html" target="_blank">Sebastian</a>" by Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel. A rock hymn if ever there was one. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRWNtxroU4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
