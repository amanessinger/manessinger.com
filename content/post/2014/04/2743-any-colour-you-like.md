Weather was cool and rainy in Carinthia, but hey, it's spring, there are always the flowers, right?

Or so I thought when I took the car and drove to a place in front of a church, a place where I had seen a multitude of beautiful tulips, red and yellow, among a host of daisies. I arrived, took a couple of uninspired images and quickly recognized that I was too lightly clad. Back to the car.

In the end the few flower images were embarrassingly bad, but when I converted this image of parking cars to black and white, I decided that there's hope to get away with it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Any Colour You Like" from the album "Dub Side of the Moon". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbqL5AJ5pfs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
