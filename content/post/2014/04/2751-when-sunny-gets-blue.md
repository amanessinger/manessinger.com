In general, Saturday was a sunny day, except for the two hours while I was out with the intention of taking photographs. In the end I spent the time shopping and mourning the sun through rain-splashed windows. Naturally, as soon as I was back home, the sun was again up in a clear blue sky. I didn't let it fool me once more though ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/barbra_streisand/when_sunny_gets_blue.html" target="_blank">When Sunny Gets Blue</a>" from the 1967 album "Simply Streisand". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTM8HZsw_Zo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
