Yesterday's cafÃ© is opposite Velden's casino, an establishment that I've visited exactly once in my life, almost 30 years ago. Roulette is not my game ðŸ™‚

Obviously some time has passed and the casino is being renovated at the moment. I was already on my way back to the car when I saw the tent at the entrance, and I didn't have to wait for long until I got a couple in the right position.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/casino_boogie.html" target="_blank">Casino Boogie</a>" from the classic Rolling Stones album "Exile On Main Street". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7ETn56GWHQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
