Imperial architecture in Vienna can be quite impressive. This is the cupola of the Natural History Museum in Vienna. It's the kind of faux historic buildings that was built along RingstraÃŸe after Napoleon had forced down the medieval walls, making place for Emperor Franz Josef's new boulevard.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20140421_105445_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20140421_105445_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In defense of our architectural honor I have to say that, although none of the representational buildings along RingstraÃŸe is from the era that it claims to be, the whole ensemble is pretty tasteful. 

If you remember a very similar image from "<a href="/2013/07/2456-big-stuff.html" target="_blank">2456 â€“ Big Stuff</a>", well, that was in the Arts museum, a twin building right across the square. I repeat myself, but only in a way ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Little Palaces" from Elvis Costello's 1986 album "King Of America". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyLwwM8v89Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
