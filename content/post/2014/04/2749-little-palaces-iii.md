I've squeezed one last image out of my visit to the Natural History Museum in Vienna. This is the lower flight of the central stairway, leading up from the entrance hall below the cupola. It was taken from one of the two symmetrically arranged upper flights. They lead from the first landing back up to the restaurant, also below the cupola.

The Song of the Day is still “Little Palaces” from Elvis Costello’s 1986 album "King Of America". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyLwwM8v89Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
