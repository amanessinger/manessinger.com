Do you know what a "velum quadragesimale" or lenten cloth is? It's kind of a curtain that used to be hung in front of a church's altar during lent. Luther did away with that custom in protestant countries, and even in the catholic parts of Europe it has become nearly extinct. There is only a small region in northern Germany where it is still alive and - where the tradition is most alive - that is my home country of Carinthia.

It's basilica is quite important though, and it has even been visited by Pope John Paul II. It's lenten cloth, to come back to the topic, is the oldest in Carinthia, dating back to 1458. That's only five years after the fall of Constantinople and 34 years before Columbus arrived in America ðŸ™‚

It still gives a good idea though.

Hope you enjoy it.
