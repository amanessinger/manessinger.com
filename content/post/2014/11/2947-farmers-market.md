"Ursulamarkt" is a traditional farmer's market in Klagenfurt, my hometown. Believe it or not, this year I've been there for the first time in my life.

It's, well, not very traditional any more. You see the usual fairground attractions, but still a few things remain. Inside of the halls it's obviously too expensive for selling handmade brooms and the like, so you'll only find professional traders there, mostly from northern Italy, but outside there are things on display that you won't see elsewhere.

That I still show you plastic toys, well, it is because they were too photogenoc to resist ðŸ™‚

As I look at the image now, I'd say the reds and yellows could be more saturated, and that is because I have processed the image on my old Sony VAIO laptop, a computer with unbalancedly vibrant reds. I normally didn't trust its display and I certainly shouldn't have for this image ðŸ˜„

Anyway. The Song of the Day is "Farmer's Market" by Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH0X_L2qCHU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
