The Image of the Day is my so far most successful image on Flickr. It made it into Explore early and ended up as #22 on November 12. The first day it drew 26,000 views, followed by 8,300 on the next day.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20141101_143710_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20141101_143710_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The second image has been taken with the same 12-40/2.8, this time on its long end. It also got into Explore, but only near the end of the day. Still, that made for 50,000 views in three days. Not that I particularly agree with the choice of images, but then, when have I? ðŸ˜„
