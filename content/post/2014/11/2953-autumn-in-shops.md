Pumpkins. As children we used to steal them from the fields, hollow them out and put candles into them. We just didn't call it Helloween. Today Helloween and Santa Claus, two aliens from America, hold Austria tightly in their grasp. I guess you could call that cultural coherence, but it feels more like colonization ðŸ™‚

Anyway. The Song of the Day is "Autumn In New York" by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50zL8TnMBN8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
