When I recently walked down to Donaukanal in search of the last sun, I was already too late. Yesterday's image was taken immediately after I had emerged from the Underground. Then the sun was away.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2014/20141014_165104_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2014/20141014_165104_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the other hand, there are subjects that don't need sunlight at all, for example colorful graffiti, and that's something you'll find there aplenty.

The Song of the Day is once more "The Walls Keep Talking" by Anita O'Day, recorded in her Gene Krupa days. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbgBJFu3_jM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
