It's cold while I write this and colder when you finally read it (unless you're a certain guy in Australia), but this was the end of one of the last warm days. I went down to Donaukanal, a channel once built to bring goods from river Danube into the city. This is a place where lots of people enjoy the sun during summer. Even in October you get a feeling for it, especially in this fading light, when people take in the last warmth of the sun.

"Warmth Of The Sun" by the Beach Boys is the Song of The Day. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmRzGxsexIQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
