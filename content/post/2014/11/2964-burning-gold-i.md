This time of the year it's a good idea to take advantage of every sunny day one can get. It's already three weeks since and it was a sunny afternoon when I left work very eary to go down to the river. As you see, the sun was already coming in very, very low, but sun it was and it poured joy in my heart ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Burning Gold" by Christina Perri. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aNxhQKAXxE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
