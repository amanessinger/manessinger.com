That's not exactly white, but it's white enough. This is a grill protecting the base of a tree in Znojmo, Czech Republic. I had to take out a few leaves and in earlier days this would have been a case of heavy photoshopping. Today I can do that pretty easily in plain Lightroom.

The Song of the Day is again "White Stripes" by Instituto Mexicano del Sonido aka Mexican Institute of Sound. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF0CYRJAFxc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
