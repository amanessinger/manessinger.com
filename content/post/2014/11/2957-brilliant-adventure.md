Winter often comes early in Carinthia. I had to wait for the tires of my car to be changed, and while I waited, I did what I always do when waiting: I took a few pictures.

The Song of the Day is "Brilliant Adventure" by David Bowie. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENHI3c4APTs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
