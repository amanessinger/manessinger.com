An ad poster praising the ubiquity and quality of Vienna's public transport. And they're right. I love Vienna's Underground lines, the cleanliness and the punctuality. Ask people in Vienna though, and they may complain and tell all sorts of horror stories, but that's nonsense. Public transport is really exemplary here and the Viennese are famous for complaining about everything ðŸ™‚
