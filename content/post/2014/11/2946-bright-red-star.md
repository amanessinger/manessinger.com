I am not satisfied with this image. It is not what I saw in reality and it is not what I set out to make of the image when I saw it in Lightroom for the first time. I don't consider it a bad image per se, but color troubles me. The green is not what I think it should be, while the red certainly is. It's not that I haven't tried different kinds of green, but somehow what I have looks still best to me, regardless of what I do. Go figure ðŸ™‚
