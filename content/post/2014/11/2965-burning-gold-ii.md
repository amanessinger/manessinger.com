A promenade shared by pedesterians and bikers runs along the river, flanked by small gardens. I suppose at one time they were to be had cheaply, but that time is also long gone. I loved the golden light on that painted garden gate with the full fire of autumn leaves behind. I may have exaggerated it a bit in processing, but hey, we need something to get us through winter, don't we? ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is one more time "Burning Gold" by Christina Perri. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aNxhQKAXxE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
