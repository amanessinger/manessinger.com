If you ask me why exactly I've taken this image and even devoted a post to it ... I don't know. Somehow it appeals to me. A neglected patch of land, waiting to finally be graced with an office building and - more important to the people living nearby - a supermarket. It's been like that for three years and nobody knows when construction work will begin.

The Song of the Day is "The Way It Is" by Bruce Hornsby. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOeKidp-iWo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
