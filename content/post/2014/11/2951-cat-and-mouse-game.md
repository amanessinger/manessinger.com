"Prater", the big amusement park in Vienna is only a few Underground stations away from where I live now. It was a cold night and I was in desparate need for some images, so I thought, heck, why not go for a place full of lights?

The Song of the Day is "Cat And Mouse Game" by Dr. John. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBk6tRwbXtQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
