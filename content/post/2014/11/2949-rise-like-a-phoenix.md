Here's the promised second graffiti. In this part of the city the "Underground" actually runs on pillars high above ground level. Directly below the station is a skateboard ground, completely covered in graffiti. This one is not on a wall but on a skateboard ramp. I had to use some Photoshop magic to get rid of the distortions.

The Song of the Day is "Rise Like A Phoenix", this year's winner of the Eurovision Song Contest by our own Conchita Wurst. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaolVEJEjV4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
