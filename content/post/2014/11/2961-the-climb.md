This is the stairwell of a pedestrian crossing over a railway line near to where I work. I had to hold the camera very low above the dirt, at the same time trying to avoid being in the shot. It took me about ten images until I had something usable. An ultra-wide would have helped, but the 12/2.0 was the widest in my bag ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "The Climb" by Miley Cyrus, aka Hannah Montana. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG2zyeVRcbs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
