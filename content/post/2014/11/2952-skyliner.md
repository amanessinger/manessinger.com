For a long time Vienna was pretty conservative when it came to high-rise buildings. The first of them, built right into the historic center to a whopping height of twelve stories, was actually shaped a little bit like a pyramid, at least what regarded its upper stories. The purpose was, to make the real height invisible from the narrow streets surrounding it. 

That time is long gone. Today skyscrapers are built in new quarters, the former outskirts of the city. The building to the far right is the United Nations complex. At its right, not on this image, would be a tall building with its top three floors rented by the US embassy. That's from where the US spy on the UN ðŸ™‚

The skyscraper with the funny facade in the center is (or was a year ago) something like Europe's fourth-tallest office building and the really not exactly dwarvish tower left of it is where lots of rich people bought in years ago, all in envious fury looking at the new tower right in front of their noses. Sometimes it is nice to have only small problems ðŸ˜„
