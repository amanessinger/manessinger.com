Here we are with an image taken in Znojmo, just across the border and into the Czech Republic. These yellow dots seem to be used to slow cars down. In any case they are decorative. The image was taken with the Olympus 12/2.0, another one of my hopelessly underutilized lenses. See why I was reluctant of shelling out 1600&nbsp;â‚¬ for the 40-150/2.8? Oh my!

The Song of the Day is "Connect The Dots" by Rabbit! By the way, the exclamation mark is part of the band's name ðŸ™‚

Hear the song on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPJttLFkoEs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
