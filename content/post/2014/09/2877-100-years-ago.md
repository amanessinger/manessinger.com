Well, really I am not sure about how old this derelict hotel opposite the also derelict old train station of Tarvisio, Italy really is. !00 years are something like an educated guess. I grew up in a house that's architecturally similar and that is about a hundred years old. 

Anyway. The best times of this hotel are over. Since the highway to Italy was built, Tarvisio, the border town, has lost its importance, and even more so, now that Austria and Italy have completely open borders. The town is still important for winter sports, but that happens in another part and in newer hotels near the slopes.

The Song of the Day is "100 Years Ago" by the Rolling Stones. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrciVFFw3iQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
