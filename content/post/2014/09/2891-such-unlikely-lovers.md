Seeking shelter from the rain in Villach, we made a stop at a caf√©. In front of it, while I smoked a cigarette outside (yes, I recently began smoking again), I saw this unlikely couple: a leaf, seemingly growing from a feather, both drenched in rain.

The Song of the Day is "Such Unlikely Lovers" by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K11ixyV1byg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
