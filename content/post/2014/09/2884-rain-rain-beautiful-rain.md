People around here generally agree that this was one lousy summer. I won't complain though and the rain can't keep me from making images. Here is one taken from the train ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Rain, Rain, Beautiful Rain" by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. If they somehow flew under your radar so far, you may at least remember them from Paul Simon's masterful album "Graceland". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz_uDRgoax8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
