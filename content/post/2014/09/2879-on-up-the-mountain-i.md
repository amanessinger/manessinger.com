This image has been taken on a short trip to one of the biggest mountains near Villach, Mangart, a peak right where Austria, Italy and Slovenia meet. I was not at the peak, just took the road to the highest parking lot at about 2000 meters. Still, with the help of wide angles I got some nice pictures for this and the next two posts.

The Song of the Day is "On Up The Mountain" by Jakob Dylan. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpkaI9jqZk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
