I've recently found that the best time for me to post images on Flickr is the evening. When an image gets lucky (such as the one in "<a href="/2014/09/2885-very-ape.html" target="_blank">2885 â€“ Very Ape</a>") it gets near to ten faves that evening, and then only one or two in the morning suffice to push it into Explore. By the way, that part of a poster for "Planet of the Apes" is my most successful image on Flickr so far. I peaked at 26,707 views and 141 favorites that day. Why exactly this image? Who knows ðŸ˜„

Today's image is a total loser on Flickr. Some views, not a single favorite. I like it though, and what I like most, that's the head of the street light peeking into the image from the lower left corner ðŸ™‚
