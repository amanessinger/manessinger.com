Same hotel as yesterday. Today we have a door that has been closed and won't ever again open.

Like in "<a href="/2014/02/2688-closed-today.html" target="_blank">2688 â€“ Closed Today</a>", the Song of the Day is "Closed Today" by Naked Lunch, a band from my home town Klagenfurt. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0dMlOuQzU8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
