I have no idea why one of the upper story windows of this house in Villach displays an advertising of a woman on a towel, likely taken in a Spa, but along with the shape of the old window it fascinated me ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Woman At The Window" by a group called Team of the Union. I suppose the Russian Union that is, at least I don't understand a single word ðŸ˜„ Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG_38vugTZ4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
