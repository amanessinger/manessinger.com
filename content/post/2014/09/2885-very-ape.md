I generally like Science Fiction, but I've never seen any "Planet of the Apes" movie. The new one has not been an exception so far. Is it any good? Or is it just another remake of a remake, spiced up with 3D effects?

I did see this advertising poster though. The sun falling through a fence left a grim pattern that I found strangely appropriate ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Very Ape" by Nirvana. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91yrS5PUJBY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
