Advertising posters frequently inspire me. I can't really tell why, but maybe it's the fact that hardly an ad comes without a lie ðŸ™‚

This ad is for a dating service.

The Song of the Day is "Disguises" by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzL8YFQGfgM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
