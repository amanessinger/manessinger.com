2900. Good. 

On the other hand, for the first time in an eternity I saw my Statcounter stats this morning, and it was, well, discouraging. I've just confirmed it now on Google Analytics: At the moment, and this moment seems to have lasted for at least a year, my blog draws around 20 to 50 visitors per day. Even over the last year there was a slow decline.

I remember when I did a few Photoshpo tutorials in between and when I was among the first who had a Nikon D300 review online, 250 per day was low traffic. Good posts, that I actively promoted, drew a few thousand visits the first day, and they constantly brought traffic over years.

I don't do all that any more. I don't even write daily. What you get these days is canned content, posted on a regular schedule. That of course makes it impossible to write about current news, because how should I know what will be current two weeks ahead?

Anyway, I don't complain, I am interested, thus a question to those who may still read this: Most of you are bloggers and I suppose you use Google Analytics, Statcounter or something like that, just as I do. Do you see a similar decline? Is this only a result of my lack of effort promoting the blog or go blogs out of fashion? Have they already done so and it's only I who has not recognized?

Not that it makes much of a difference. I'm stubborn ðŸ™‚
