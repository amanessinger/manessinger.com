I'm the first to say that the Olympus OM-D E-M1 is a killer camera, but as so many top cameras it seems to have a quality control problem. The most notorious case in recent times was the oil-splattering mirror of the Nikon D600. Olympus also had problems with display frames cracking under too much pressure of the mounting screws. You see it everywhere. It's part of the business of building ever more complex systems. Frequently it's software that fails, but hardware definitely has its share.

The E-M1's weak point seems to be its rear dial. Many people report it to be not (always) responsive. There's a thread about that <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/groups/om-d_user/discuss/72157642468118213/#comment72157646763452215" target="_blank">on Flickr</a>, but I've read about it long before.

I've always been mildly afflicted, but recently it got progressive. It's not that the rear dial does not respond sometimes, it is the rare occasion that it responds at all! 

The interesting thing is, that the dial feels just as it ever did: solid, precise, not in the slightest way different from the front dial. The problem does not seem to be mechanical. Maybe it's some kind of corrosion, at least that would explain the progressiveness.

In any case it seems that I'll have to send in my camera for service. If that is so, I'll be reduced to my old Panasonic LX5 for a few weeks. I suppose I'll get over it. That camera didn't get enough love in recent times anyway ðŸ™‚

And then: there is always my old D300. I still have the Sigma 20/1.8 and the Sigma 28/1.8 as lenses and, if I think of it, there is also a Nikon 24/2.8 AI-S. And a Lensbaby. Oh my ðŸ˜„
