There's an inn at the edge of Villach with a small brewery. In the garden stands a small wooden tower and therefore they call themselves the "Tower Brewery". These wooden discs are attached to the tower. One shows the Carinthian coat of arms, the others are engraved with reports of rafter's adventures.

The Song of the Day is "Stories, Trophies And Memories" by Randy VanWarmer. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf7edWkjleg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
