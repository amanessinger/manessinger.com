Given the fact that I work in a part of Vienna now, that a majority of Viennese would consider the end of the world, it's remarkable how much inspiration I find in the immediate vicinity of my office. 

This splotch of orange paint is on the pavement in front of the building, just where I always have to wait before I can cross the extremely busy street. The orange may not be just as orange and the asphalt may not be just as bluish in reality, but that's what post-processing is for. And besides, isn't reality terribly overrated? ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Song With Orange" by Charles Mingus. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7BPbDdsEzg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
