The local museum in Villach currently runs an exhibition of old pictures of the city, mostly early photographs some paintings and some early maps. It's pretty interesting to see, what the place where you live has looked like, one or two hundred years ago. 

Of course even ten years sometimes make a tremendous difference. Take for instance the part of Vienna where I live now. It's currently expanding like mad and it does so in a mostly positive way. In fact Vienna invests a lot in planning and infrastructure, in order to not repeat the sins of the past.

But I digress. The bust in the image is from the museum and it shows the emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria" target="_blank">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a>, commonly referred to as "The Emperor", just as if there never had been another monarch claiming the title ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "The Emperor" by Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXDaEs0WIS4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
