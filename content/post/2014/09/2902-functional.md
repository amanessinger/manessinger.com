I am a programmer and programming means to build something that nobody ever has built, following unclear plans to vaguely described places, often using tools that nobody ever before has used, and when you think you're done, the client tells you that the office building that he has ordered should in reality be a palace, but for the price of a stable.

That's not all though. The world is changing and in order to stay in business, to stay relevant, you better learn constantly.

That's what I do now. I've learned the whole JavaScript ecosystem last winter, found it lacking in many ways, and now I am busy learning Scala, a hybrid language bridging the paradigms of object-oriented and functional programming. Sounds involved but I enjoy it ðŸ™‚
