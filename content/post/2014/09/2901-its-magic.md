Hmm ... ok, so blogs have gone out of fashion. The interesting thing is, that blogs cater to a specificneed for communication. A YouTube channel or a Facebook page, they have completely different patterns of update and of interaction. I wonder what kind of medium fulfills this role in today's Internet?

And then there is the sort of blog where interaction still happens. <a href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Paul Lester</a> comes to my mind. I mean, Paul is just an extraordinarily nice guy - and he is a communicator. I'm not ðŸ™‚

Well, as I said, I won't stop blogging. I'm just wondering ðŸ˜„

Here's an image seen while walking through Villach on a sunny day. Triumph is one of the big old manufacturers of underwear around here and the "magic" advertised in the window is something about no wires. Well, whatever, but I found it funny to see the word magic in the same context as these "mannequins", magically reduced to a bare minimum.

The Song of the Day is "It's Magic" by Doris Day. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRp1LZOk05o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
