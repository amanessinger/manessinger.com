Everything is narrow here at the center of a castle. Imagine the
claustrophobic situation when the enemy has already entered the
outer courtyard. Once that happens, you know it's almost over. I
don't know if that ever happened here, but it certainly happens all
over the world all the time. Imagine living a quiet, ordinary life
in Syria or in Yemen or ...

A life like mine, a life like your's ... and ... then imagine how,
completely without your doing, your whole world shatters and falls
apart. If you're lucky you are a refugee - and that's not much luck
at all.
