Apart from the exhibition, the castle also houses a museum of "rural
life". You see clothes, furniture, tools and so on. I suppose those
things are in general not older than 120 years, but it does not make
much of a difference. While rapid change occurred much earlier in
the cities, rural regions just took up at about that time.
