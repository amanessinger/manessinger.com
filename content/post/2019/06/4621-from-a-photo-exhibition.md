This is clearly a copyright violation. I don't even know the name of
the photographer. What you see here are two photos of the same
person, one friendly, one aggressive. They are mounted on triangular
prisms, so that you see one photo when you look from the left side,
the other from the right side. I found it most interesting from the
front :smiley:

There is a couple of similar images, but this was the most easy to
photograph without excessive reflections. The photos alone are a
good reason to visit castle and exhibition.
