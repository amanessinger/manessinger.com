On the way to Vienna, Lockenhaus was on the way. They have a castle
as well, but I've already seen it and this time it was too late. I
had a look into the church though.

I didn't expect anything, and what I found was a dark and gloomy
building. Well, unless I exposed for 0.3 seconds. Honestly, I was
surprised myself :smiley:
