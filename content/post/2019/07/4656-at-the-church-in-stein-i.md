Of the two churches in yesterday's image, we are now in the nearer
one, the one that looked higher. 

It's slightly lacking in symmetry, but that is something frequently
encountered in old churches. And it's not even that they couldn't
build symmetrically. Often there are weird reasons, for instance a
window is positioned so that light falls on a certain point at a
certain time at a certain date. As a tourist you never would know,
and even the locals normally don't. We've lost our connection to
that kind of symbolism.
