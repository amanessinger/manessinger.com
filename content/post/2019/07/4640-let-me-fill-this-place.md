So that's what a spare room in a castle looks like.

Well, I'd have good use for it. Let's begin with the walls between
the windows. Don't they beg for book shelves? Walnut, probably? Even

blue. 

For instance a snooker table with blue instead of green cloth. I
always wanted my own snooker table - and the room for it :smiley:
