50 meters apart? Honestly, I don't know. Fact is, in old cities you
see that a lot. You have normal parish churches, churches of
monasteries, churches built to commemorate important events and
so on and so forth.

In this case the church on the hill has replaced an older church
first mentioned in 1081. I suppose the rock with the original church
has has given name to the town: Stein an der Donau means  Rock at
the Danube.
