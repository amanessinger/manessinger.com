Old towns have something organic, that is hard to achieve with
modern city planning. In olden days you didn't just use a ton of
explosives on a rock that happened to be in the way. You built with
and around the rock. Of course you also didn't build structures a
hundred meters high. The shape of a city was still defined by its
rocks and not by its buildings.
