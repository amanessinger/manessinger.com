I normally never post Images taken with my smartphone. Not because
it makes particularly bad images. It does not at all. It's just that
I almost always have a real camera and a couple of lenses with me.

Here I found a closed door and no opportunity to get my camera
through between the bars. I'd have had a problem if I'd had funbled
and let my phone slip, but thankfully I didn't :smiley:
