Overwhelmingly rich decorations in a church at the end of the world.
Well, it may not be the end of the world, but, as they say, you can
see it from there. Humanity has strange priorities. But then, if you
blame it on God's will, everything is possible.

Of course I've thoroughly enjoyed the visit, but nevertheless,
there's a dark secret behind all that beauty.
