We've already [been there](/tags/sonntagberg), but this time I've
brought proper gear: the OM-D E-M1mk2 and the 7-14/2.8. Fortunately
there was no service, the church was open for visits and few people
were there.

By the way: this is the probably first time in years that I missed
posting schedule by more than a few hours. One more post will appear
today. Sorry for that.
