I'm not entirely sure why this is a black and white image. I may
have tried in color first, but given that yesterday's image was
black and white as well, it is even possible I didn't. As I said,
they come in flocks :smiley:

And then, let's admit, most images work quite well both ways. You
have to go different ways processing them, and some may peak
differently. Sometimes I even like to explore a successful image the
other way. Just for fun.
