The maximum aperture of the Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95 is a bonus
in low light. Other than that, the lens is just a very good normal
lens. That's how I use it mostly.

In other words: I use this lens' capabilities according to the
situation. I don't select situations according to the capabilities
of my lens :smiley:
