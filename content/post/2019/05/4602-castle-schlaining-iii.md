We have quite a crisis in Austria at the moment. You may remember
our far-right "Freedom Party", the party that constantly insists on
being NOT a Nazi party. It's the former party of JÃ¶rg Haider, the
guy who greatly extended the range of "what can be said".

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2018/20180402_110433_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2018/20180402_110433_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Haider died behind the steering wheel of his 
luxury car in a foggy October night, when he drove far too fast and
with far too much alcohol in his blood.

At that time he had already split the party, but his attempt to take
over all the followers and leave the old party with all the debt,
this mostly failed. His new party was successful in the province of
Carinthia, where he was Governor, but nowhere else.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2018/20180402_110320_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2018/20180402_110320_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The original freedom party had a new leader, 
some Heinz Christian Strache, who likes to call himself H.C.
Strache.

Strache, while always having been a cheap imitation of his former
idol Haider, in the end had a surprising career as the so far
longest-serving leader of the party.

Until now that is. Last Friday at 6pm excepts from a video were
published by two respectable German newspapers. The video shows
Strache and his long-time close friend Johann Gudenus in a Finca on
Ibiza, meeting with the alleged daughter of a Russian oligarch.

The young woman claims to want to "invest" (actually launder) money
in Austria, to buy Austria's biggest newspaper and to financially
support the Freedom Party with illegal donations. With almost
incredible openness Strache offers to route federal business towards
companies controlled by the "investor".

It's something everybody has supposed to happen behind the scenes,
but never before has a politician been caught candidly discussing
corruption in such a shameless manner.

The video exploded onto the political scene, just a week before the
elections to the European Parliament. It is not clear so far who
made it, neither is it clear why it is used exactly now. The making
of the video was also clearly illegal and extremely expensive. The
involvement of foreign secret services is rumored, but whatever the
back story is, one thing is clear: It's Strache, and he talks
freely, boasting like a teenager, and almost everything is an image
of total moral and political corruption.

One day later, Strache was stripped of all his political functions
(Vice-Chancellor of Austria and Minister for Sports). A day or two
later, Chancellor Kurz, a populist himself, dismissed the Minister
of the Interior, head of the Police, because at the time the video
was made, he could impossibly not have known about the affair.
Kurz's argument was, that he can't investigate against himself. As a
consequence, the other ministers of the Freedom Party resigned and
the coalition broke.

How's that for a crisis, huh? And it seems to still go on :smiley:
