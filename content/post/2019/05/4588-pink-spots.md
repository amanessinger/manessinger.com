I love it to stroll through the inner city in the morning. I do that
rarely now since I've moved to the periphery. On the other hand, I
am too cheap to just take a day off from time to time. That's what I ought to do :smiley:

At that day I was in the center for some workshop, and I started out
early to have a bit of free photography time.
