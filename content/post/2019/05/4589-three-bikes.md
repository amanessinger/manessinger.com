The dark yellow bike in the middle is an "OBIKE". That's a Singapore
based bike sharing company. It flooded all Europe with cheap,
low-quality bikes that nobody wanted to use. When they stopped
providing service here, even they didn't want their bicycles back.

Funny how business fashions work. What a tremendous waste of energy,
time and money!
