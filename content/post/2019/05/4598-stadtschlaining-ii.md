Burgenland, "Land of the Castles", was invented after World War I.
At that time it was actually a Hungarian province with strong German
speaking majority. For centuries this wouldn't have made much of a
difference, because Austria and Hungary were united under the reign
of the Habsburg family. When the war was over and the emperor gone,
it was time to part. Not much love was left between the two states,
and each tried to cling to what it could get.

In the end Burgenland came to Austria. It is named after four cities
with names ending on "burg". Austria claimed all of them and got
none. Three of them ended up in Hungary, one, (Pre√üburg, today
Bratislava), was given to Czechoslovakia and is now the capital of
Slovakia.
