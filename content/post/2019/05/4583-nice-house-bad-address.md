Some time between 150 and 120 years ago, someone spent a big amount
of money to build this house. At that time the street was the second
circular boulevard around the center. A noble address, worthy of
fine architecture.

Today it is one of the most busy streets around, it's loud and you'd
better not jaywalk. Funny how ow times and places change.
