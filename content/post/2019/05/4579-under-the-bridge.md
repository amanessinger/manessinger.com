Complexity. Again.

Have you ever tried to switch your main computer from one operating
system to another? I've done it, when I went from Windows to MacOS
in fall 2014.

It was a mess, but not as bad as expected. Sure, I had to deal with
a strange keyboard with not enough keys, I had the usual troubles
with Ctrl/Command, Alt/Option and the fact that the Mac has a Ctrl
key as well. After some time I got sufficiently proficient and I
didn't have problems on Windows or Linux either.

All my main software is available on Windows 10 and MacOS. A switch
back to Windows might be relatively painless as well. Or not?

Macs are extremely expensive. It would be nice to have an option to
buy for instance a Dell XPS 15 or a Gigabyte Aero 15-Y9. Sure, they
are almost as expensive as Macbooks, but you get faster hardware
and/or better specs for your money.

The Gigabyte Aero 15-Y9 gets you 64 GB of memory, the fastest Intel
hexa-core processor, up to four TB of SSD, plus the Nvidia RTX 2080
Max-Q, the fastest notebook graphics processor money can buy, USB-A,
USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, there's even an SD card reader. You simply
can't buy that from Apple.

But ... do we really need 64 GB?

Well, actually I could make use of it :smiley:

And what if I don't like it? What if I don't like Windows? What if I
start missing the Mac?

In short words: I've bought a Windows laptop. It's an experiment. I
want to find out if I can work and live with Windows and still like
it.

It's not a top-of-the-line laptop costing 4000+. It's still
expensive though. I've bought a last year's ASUS ZenBook 15.
Quad-core i7, 16 GB of memory and 512 GB SSD. Slightly slower
processor than my current Mac, no Retina display, but otherwise
quite comparable. I'll use it for a while, make my experiments and
then sell it on with a loss. Still, it will be worth it.

I'll keep you updated on my experiences.
