Solingen, a city in Germany, once was a big name in steel. Maybe it
still is, but I suspect things have changed. This shop, seemingly
once owned by some Sylvia North, looks as if taken out of the 1930s.

Is it still open? I don't know. That morning it was not, but that's
no wonder. It was too early. I suppose it's still a shop though. The
district is too expensive to have shops closed for decades.
