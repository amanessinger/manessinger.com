This week I am in Vienna with my Mac. The Windows laptop is not yet
ready. I'll still need to install the necessary Lightroom plugins
and I am sure there'll creep up some other things.

The last week I missed my Amazon credentials, and therefore I
couldn't upload images to my Amazon S3 bucket. You find such things
out once you try them, but if you do that only once a few weeks,
chances are, that you miss something anytime you try anything - and
that for weeks :smiley:
