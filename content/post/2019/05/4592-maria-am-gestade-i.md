[Maria am Gestade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_am_Gestade)
is one of the two or three oldest churches in Vienna, and it is one
of the few, that have survived in their Gothic form. Baroque was the
fashion when Austria's had its last big time of power. Most churches
were almost rebuilt in Baroque style. This one and a few others are
different.
