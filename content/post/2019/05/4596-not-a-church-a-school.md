Here we are in a small village in Burgenland. What a nice small
church, I thought. I stopped to make an image, just to find out that
it is not a church at all.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2018/20180402_104532_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2018/20180402_104532_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's an elementary school. This explains the
small size of the main building but not the tower. I have no idea
what the story behind it is, but I'm sure there is one.
