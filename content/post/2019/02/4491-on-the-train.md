In a way the square is a much more abstract aspect ratio than the
camera's native 4:3 or 3:2. Maybe this is due to the fact that
square images have no "natural" direction. With a rectangle I always
feel the tendency to align that "natural" direction with features in
the image. The square eliminates all this.

You read lots of opinions about why electronic viewfinders are
better or worse than their optical counterparts, but for me the
probably most important feature is the option to compose in
different aspect ratios, and that's where Olympus cameras excel: you
compose in square, but you get a full 4:3 image. In Lightroom I see
the RAW image in a square preview, just as I've envisioned it, but I
can always change my mind later.

This is helpful with two problems: The first is, that I'm sometimes
slightly off. No problem, select "Crop" and you get the full image,
with the crop overlay showing the original square. Sometimes just
moving the overlay a few pixels is enough to fix it.

The other problem is, that I sometimes change my mind. I often look
at the full image, and it happens that I see an interesting
different crop.

That's it: the best of both worlds. The EVF allows me to see what
the image in the intended format will look like, and I still have
all options left. For me that's priceless.
