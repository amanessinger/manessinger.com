Klagenfurt, my hometown, has a more or less regular structure. Not
exactly a chess board, but not far from it. Normally this is a hint
that the town has either been built from scratch (usually during
Renaissance, like for instance
[Palmanova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmanova)) or that it had
to be re-built after a catastrophe. In our case the catastrophe was
a big fire in 1514.
