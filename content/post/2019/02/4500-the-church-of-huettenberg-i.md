Hüttenberg in north-east Carinthia once was a big mining center.
This time is long past, but you still see buildings of a size and
expensive construction, that you wouldn't expect in a small market
town out in a remote valley.

I am not sure what happened to the church's choir and why it is
without any paintings now, but the architecture is still impressive.
