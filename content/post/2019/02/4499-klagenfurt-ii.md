I can't say I particularly care about Klagenfurt. The world of my
childhood is long gone. When I go there, I do it because I have
business there. Since the death of my father, my mother lives in
Klagenfurt, alone in a big spooky house. I've asked her to come to
Villach, but she simply can't imagine leaving the house where she
was born. Well, so once a week I drive down from Villach, buy what
she needs, we talk half an hour and I drive back.

No sentimentality towards Klagenfurt. A place where I have spent the
first years of my life, but neither the biggest part nor the most
happy days. It's just a place.

How do you feel about your home town or whatever place you come from?
