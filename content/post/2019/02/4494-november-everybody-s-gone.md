I bought the Mitakon Speedmaster for its low-light capabilities. At
"normal" apertures it behaves like any other decent normal lens,
though with tendencies for uncivilized ghosting, when strong lights
are in your frame. We'll see an extreme example in a few days.

Of course the lens is manual focus only, but it is small, light and
still fully metal. Of the three(?) 25/0.95 lenses for Micro Four
Thirds it is the smallest, lightest and cheapest. For that it offers
sensational value.
