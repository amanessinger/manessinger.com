I would have thought it to be easier to sell an iPad Pro, WiFi only,
with 256 GB. True, so far I have only one ad running at Austria's
premier classified's site, but the market really seems to be flooded
at the moment. The ad has been up for a week, the price is slightly
below of what most people ask for, and I still have no single offer.

Quite unexpected.
