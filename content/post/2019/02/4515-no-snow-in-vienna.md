Vienna is north of Carinthia, but it is lower (about 200 meters).
Therefore it gets less snow in normal years. 2017 was no exception.

Btw, if you wonder if I'm contemplating the new Olympus OM-D E-M1X,
no, I don't. 

The money? Yes, it's a lot, but I've spent money on more stupid
things. 

No, it's the weight. This image was taken with the OM-D E-M1 II and
the 12-100/4 PRO. It was one of the rare occasions that I took this
combo to Vienna. Normally I use the PEN-F for Vienna, along with
three primes, and all in a very small bag.

I find it funny how people flock to the likes of Nikon Z, Sony A7 or
that new, unfinished thing Canon has. Even Panasonic seems to
abandon MFT. Yes, the images are a bit bigger, DOF is a little
shallower (whether you need it or not), but the lenses are so much
bigger and heavier. I would hate it to see Olympus go away, just
because everybody wants to break their necks :smiley:
