Today the fabulous Olympus 12-100/f4 PRO is my most favorite lens on
the OM-D E-M1 II. It works reliably and with almost insane image
stabilization.

I sometimes would need something longer, but I can live with that.
Still, what I always have in my small PRO bag, that is the 7-14/2.8.
I don't need it often, but when I do - I do :smiley:
