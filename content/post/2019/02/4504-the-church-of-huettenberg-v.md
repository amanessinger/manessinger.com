Formally this image is very similar to yesterday's, only here we
have a few more lines going straight into the corners. Nothing
special, but quite typical for what I do and how I compose. 

Most people would have stepped aside to get rid of that angular
thing in the right upper corner. For me it was just another set of
aggressive rectangles creating tension.
