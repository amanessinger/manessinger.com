Did I mention I was in Italy? I'm back now :smiley:

The weather forecast for the Umbria region in mid-Italy had been
rather unpromising. Out of 8 days there should be rain on 5 or 6.
Didn't happen though.

Yes, we had three incidents of rainfall, one of them the worst
rainstorm that I've ever seen, but none of them took longer than
half an hour. All were extremely local. There might have been a lot
more incidents all over Umbria, but none of them bothered us.

When we returned, we had strong rain from just south of Venice up to
Carinthia, and it was cold. Slightly depressing :stuck_out_tongue:
