If you ever come to that church, forget about shooting JPEG or
hitting a good white balance in-camera.

Actually, apart from being hard to balance, the colors are pretty
unusual for a church. I've seen similar churches, but not that many.
The much bigger [Saint Nicholas in
Leipzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Nicholas_Church,_Leipzig)
comes to mind.
