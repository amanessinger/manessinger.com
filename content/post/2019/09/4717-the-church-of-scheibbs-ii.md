Like often when I am in Vienna or on a trip from Vienna, I was using
the PEN-F and the three metal lenses, the 12/2.0, 17/1.8 and 75/1.8.
When I like it really, really light, I use the 12/2.0, 25/1.8 and
45/1.8. The latter two are not as beautiful as the two metal lenses,
but they are lighter and have equally brilliant optics.

In a church such a triplet of lenses is sometimes limiting. I'd wish
for the 7-14/2.8, but that is rare. Here I was forced to use the
diagonal. Did not harm though :smiley:
