Our house was on a big road out of Klagenfurt. We had a fence, but
nothing like this noise barrier, that now blocks most of the view. 

In my youth there was plenty of traffic, after all this was one of
the six main streets leading into Klagenfurt. It wasn't so bad
though. 

Sometimes in the 1990s, the northern highway bypass was completed,
and one of the three main exits for Klagenfurt suddenly connected to
our street. My uncle, living on the first floor, got all the noise,
my parents got caged behind a wall.

The pictures were taken two months after my father's death.
