This small river runs 500 meters from our house. In my childhood it
was hopelessly polluted, in my mother's it was crystal clear. In the
meantime the main polluter has partially closed, partially changed
its methods. As a result the water is said to be quite acceptable
again.

I crossed the river to fetch some medication for my father. He was
not well but still alive then. It was only a month later we learned
that it was hopeless and coming to an end.
