During the time our old office building was dismantled, I spent 
each Wednesday in an office directly opposite. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20171025_175520_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20171025_175520_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I was surprised how long it took. Clearly 
the building was solidly constructed, and due to the short
distances, the use of explosives was out of the question.
