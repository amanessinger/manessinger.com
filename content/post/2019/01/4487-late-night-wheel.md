In reality the Mitakon Speedmaster 25/0.95 has a rather brutish
bokeh, far from the "feathered" bokeh of the Olympus 25/1.2 PRO, but
in almost no case does it matter to me. Once you get near enough to
your subject, everything in the background gets creamy anyway.

Specular highlights, especially near the corners, that's where you
see the difference. Well, so what? It's not the perfect "canonical"
bokeh, but it is no less interesting or aesthetically pleasing.

Which does not mean that I wouldn't buy the 25/1.2 any time. If I
only took more images. As it is, I'd rather buy a new computer.
Currently it's money better spent :smiley:
