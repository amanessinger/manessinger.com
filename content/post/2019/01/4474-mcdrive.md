We live in strange times of no compromise. Did you know that
McDonalds just lost the trademark for the BigMac in Europe?

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2017/20171029_075551_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2017/20171029_075551_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> OK, they're going to appeal, but isn't this 
pretty unheard of? Looks like a rebellion of the european vassals. How dare they!

Well, if the Donald wouldn't cultivate the "Ugly American" to the
extend he does, I think there would be much more sympathy for
American interests in Europe and in fact all over the world. Just
like we had it for the last 70 years, even when it hurt us at times.

We see about the same in Europe's relations to the UK. When the UK
joined the EU, they got a better deal than everybody else, and
Thatcher later stronghanded the EU into something even more
advantageous.

Today, after this endless farce that is Brexit, our compassion with
our fellows on the island comes to an end. Brexit is probably the
greatest disaster to the UK since they lost their Empire. We know
it, half of their population knows it, and the other half will soon
know as well. But what can we do? The UK is plagued by the worst and
most ineffective government in a lifetime, combined with a torn and
directionless opposition.

Strange times indeed.
