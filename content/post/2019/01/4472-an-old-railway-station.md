Funny. I first had the title "At The Inn" for this image. I remember
an inn that looked very similar (or at least that's what I
remember), but this is a railway station near Klagenfurt. 
 
The station doesn't house much more than ticket machines these days.
There may be an office upstairs, but nothing accessible to the
general public. No snacks, no shop, no nothing. Toilets I hope
