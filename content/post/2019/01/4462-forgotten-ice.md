My cache of images from 2017 is coming to an end and I have just
started the Lightroom catalog for 2019. This is a good time to look
back and - find a few forgotten images. Therefore: before we go on
with the last few of 2017 chronologically, let's catch up with the
forgotten ones.

This one is from my first session in 2017. I've already milked it
extensively, but actually I like this composition, so here we go.
