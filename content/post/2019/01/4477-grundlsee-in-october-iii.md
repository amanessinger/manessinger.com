Did I mention that I am not entirely satisfied with my iPad Pro? I
hate it how my tablet feels different from my phone, I hate the lack
of a proper Back button, I hate that I have to go into the browser
for buying a new eBook, instead of being able to just shop from the
Kindle app. There's more, but let's keep it at that.

Some days ago I finally decided to do something about it. I bought a
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.

Better? In some ways. Mostly not. First of all I got it with a
security patch level August 2018. OK, at the very same evening it
was updated to December 2018. After the update it also feels faster.
The first impression had been "Much slower than the iPad", now it's
still slower, but you have to be very attentive to feel the
difference.

Obviously the user interface is what I was looking for, especially
as I can run the same launcher app on tablet and phone.

As to the aspect ratio: the Samsung is narrower and taller. That
means it's less usable in landscape mode, at least in you don't use
it for viewing video. The iPad's 4:3 aspect ration is more
comfortable for everything that counts for me.

A big minus is the screen. It's colors shift strongly with the angle
you look at it. As a photographer it makes you cringe, although in
general it is much better than Samsung's OLEDs used to be. No
oversaturated reds any more. My own images look acceptable.

The lesson learned is: Apple's prices for tablets are outrageous,
but at least on the hardware side you get what you pay for.

The original plan was, to immediately sell the iPad. I guess I'll
wait a few days though. Who knows? I may sell the Samsung again,
keep it as I intended or even keep both. We'll see.
