Ahh, the Mighty Mouse, the root of all evil copyright legislation
:smiley:

The funny thing is, that patents and copyrights are always portrayed
as measures for protecting and fostering creativity. Nothing could
be further from the truth! 

Capitalism does not crave creativity and constant change. It hates
and tries to inhibit competition, it converges towards monopolies or
sometimes duopolies. It tends to always produce more of the same. If
it is not regulated, it is the exact opposite of what creativity
needs. So are endlessly extended copyrights and broad patents.
