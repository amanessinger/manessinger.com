I like the looks of this kind of architecture. It's unnecessarily
ornate, it's a triumph of form over function, but still ...

Not that I'd like to live in such a building. From inside I prefer
modern architecture, and in most functional aspects I prefer it as
well.

So, what is it then? I think it's looking at it. There's more
variation and more attention to detail than you normally find in
modern architecture.
