Do you crop your images? I do it all the time. When you make
keystone corrections, it is mandatory anyway. There'd have been more
than one way to tackle this image, but as unsatisfied the unbalanced
lantern in the lower right curner makes me, cutting into the right
window was worse. Sometimes there are things you can't fix in post.

Well, of course I could simply shift the lantern right into the
corner using the clone stamp, but after a few thousand posts on this
blog I am not as desperate any more :stuck_out_tongue:
