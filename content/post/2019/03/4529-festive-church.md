This is the church of the [Maltese
Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta)
in Vienna. Quite a long history that brought them from Jerusalem via
Rhodes to Malta, Rome and indeed also Vienna.

The church was full like it always is. It's on a typical tourist
path in Vienna. I still found a way to take an image without people
and my second attempt was actually successful.

It was 1/6s, something that I normally can hold any time, but all
stabilization can help only so far, once you hold the camera high
above your head, composing on the rear LCD :smiley:
