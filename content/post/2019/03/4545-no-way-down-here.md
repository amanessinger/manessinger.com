That night I read something really, really interesting and ...
missed my stop. At that time this can be a terrible mistake.

I was lucky and had one more train that brought me back. I live on
the fringes of Vienna. Underground stations are far apart and when
you miss the last train, you're in for exercise. Not funny after
midnight :smiley:
