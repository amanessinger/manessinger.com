Steffl is a department store in Vienna, and not just any department
store. It is named after the nick name of Vienna's cathedral, it is
positioned in one of the most prominent and expensive parts of the
city and it is kind of a symbol. Think "Harrod's", only smaller
:smiley:

Of course it had better days, like all department stores. We see a
massive change in consumer behavior, and the reasons are completely
obvious. The total number of products on sale gets bigger all the
time, and even the most desirable products are not made "here" any
more, for any "here" but China.

It's the age of the dying giants. It's the age of the Internet. Try
to get something only slightly exotic locally, and in most cases
you'll gladly return to Amazon. It's not that I don't try ever
again, but the result is almost always depressing: "No, we don't
have it, but we can order it for you!". Yeah, so can I :unamused:
