This was a day when I wanted to go ultra-light. My long lens was the
fabulous Olympus 45/1.8. It's a lens that I use rarely. 

Normally I tend to select the 75/1.8, and although it is even
better, it is also much heavier. If you don't mind even more weight,
there's a 45/1.2 PRO as well. So far no interest here though
:smiley:
