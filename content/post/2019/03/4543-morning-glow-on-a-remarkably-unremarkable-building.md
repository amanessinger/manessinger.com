Welcome to ... last year :stuck_out_tongue:

Seems seems like I can close my catalog of 2017 and recover some
space on my Macbook Pro. How much space would I need on my laptop to
keep all my photos? Well, we're already there. You can buy laptops
with an SSD of 2 Terabytes. It costs you north of EUR 2500, but
we're there. Of course with my meagre 512 GB I'm always struggling,
but I know today, that my next laptop will solve my problem. That
will be in about two years (I'll keep the Mac as long as it gets
updates), and then we'll likely be able to get 4 Terabytes as well.
Thankfully I don't make videos :smiley:
