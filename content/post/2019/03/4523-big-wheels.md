It's always interesting which images draw views on
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/). The only
constant is, that they are not the images that I expect to.

On the other hand, currently any spikes would drown in an anomaly.
Two weeks ago I had a spike of 156.000 views on a single day, 99%
from Android devices. I think my maximum in a day so far was between
20k and 30k. 

If you ask me, this looks more like a run-away Flickr app than real
interest in my photos. I can only hope for the poor viewer that he
had a generous plan :smiley:
