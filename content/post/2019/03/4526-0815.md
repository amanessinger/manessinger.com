08/15 is used in the German speaking corner of the world to describe
something totally ordinary. 

The term comes from a [machine
gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_08#MG_08/15) and it was
popularized by German author Hans Hellmut Kirst's book of the same
name. He wrote about his suffering as a Wehrmacht soldier in WW II.
The story was also a big success in the movies.

It was not a good machine gun :smiley:
