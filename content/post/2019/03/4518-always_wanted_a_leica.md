I never did. A camera is a tool. In my experience from other fields
(mostly technical), old tools may sometimes still be usable, but
they never generally beat new ones.

Anyway. See the two vertical rods on this Volvo caterpillar? You'd
have to click the image for a bigger size, but it reads "Leica
Geosystems", with the familiar Leica logo added on to :)
