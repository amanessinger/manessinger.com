For some reason I've been in Vienna's center that morning. The image
timestamp is from 8:49, but of course it was an hour earlier. It
always takes me months to realize that the cameras don't
automatically adjust, when daylight saving time ends. 

Wouldn't that be an innovation? Hey, they are computers anyway, they
have WiFi anyway. How about syncing time in your home WiFi? How hard
can that be?
