And now we're in. It's one of those churches, that were built at the
end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. A rapidly expanded city needed
spiritual guidance for the masses of workers.

Those churches are big, normally in a fake Gothic style, made of
bricks, and somehow you see, that they are not the result of
centuries of organic growth.

Changes not a thing for me :smiley:
