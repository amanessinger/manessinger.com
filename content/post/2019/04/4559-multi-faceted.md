When I looked at this image, I was unsatisfied. Why does it not
glow?

And then I could remember. I tried to make it glow as yesterday's.
Didn't work. I could choose between more vivid colors and texture
detail. Take one, not both.

Yes, there are HDR monitors that can give you both. I could possibly
afford one. The problem is, it doesn't matter if I see it. The
viewers must see it and I must be able to predict what they likely
see. It's not perfect with today's mainstream technology, but it
works quite well.
