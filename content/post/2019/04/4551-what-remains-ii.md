Will Olympus stop building cameras and lenses? The rumour mills
consistently hint at it, Olympus consistently denies any intention
to do so. It does not help, and although I believe them, there is at
least the remote possibility that the rumours further damage their
business. Such self-reinforcing effects are not uncommon in our age
of social media. Honestly, who would have expected the insanity that
is Brexit? Or a President Trump??

Confident as I am, what would I do? The answer is clear: my
lenses would instantly become unsellable, so I would buy two bodies
of the then highest class. Still, not necessarily the E-M1X (still
too big), but two more E-M1 mkII, E-M1 mkIII or whatever at that time
is the top model among the bodies that I'm ready to hold.

So, how confident am I? Well, confident enough to have ordered a
"Sigma 56/F1.4 DC DN Contemporary". It's not an expensive lens, but
there are no expensive lenses left that I want to buy.

Sure, there is the 300/4 PRO, a gorgeous lens, but why would I need
it?

The 1.2 primes? More likely, but they are heavy for the PEN-F, and
that's what I prefer in Vienna: the PEN-F with a set of three small
primes. In Carinthia I use the OM-D E-M1 mkII, where they are a
better fit, but there I use my PRO zooms.

The PRO fisheye? C'mon! I have a fish and use it once in two years
for a few days :smiley:

Let's see what the 1.4 Sigma lens can do. There is a 16/1.4 and a
30/1.4 as well. At least they don't completely overlap with what I
have. The 16/1.4 is a bit big and heavy (they are available with
E-mount as well), but the 30/1.4 is definitely interesting.
