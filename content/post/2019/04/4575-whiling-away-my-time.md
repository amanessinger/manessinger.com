It's been 24 years now  of commuting between Villach and Vienna, 23
of them by train. Scary!

Scary also how time goes by and how much one forgets. Yes, I
remember the old railway station in Vienna ... but do I? Details?
Everything's pretty much gone. 

The new railway station is no architectural marvel. It's better than
its predecessor, but that's mostly because the old station was cheap
architecture from after the war. Artistic quality had not been a
priority then.
