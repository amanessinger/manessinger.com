What's a "K채sekrainer"?? Well, let's start with "Krainer". That's a
kind of sausage originating in Krain, today a part of Slovenia, up
to the end of the monarchy a part of southern Styria. "Krainer" are
the typical sausages from there, served fried at Vienna's
characteristic sausage booths called "W체rstelstand".

As to the taste, don't expect anything like the German "Bratwurst".
"Krainer" are smoked. Other than that, both are pretty fat and not
the healthiest of food :smiley:

A "K채sekrainer" is an especially opulent variant thereof,
additionally filled with cheese, that melts while frying.
