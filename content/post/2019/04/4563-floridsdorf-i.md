And here we are at the center of Floridsdorf, the only other
district north of river Danube. Two neighboring districts, it
shouldn't be too far from home, but at the periphery all ways go
through the center. It's not that there are no tangential lines, but
if the two endpoints are near Underground stations, you're always
better off radially.
