Now that I think of it, I still have used the 12-40/2.8 in Chioggia.
These times I rarely use it, and neither do I use the 40-150/2.8.
The 12-100/4 has replaced them almost completely. 

Yes, sometimes the higher magnification at the long end would be
welcome, and in a few cases the faster aperture might be of
advantage, but in practice it hardly makes a difference. Weight beats them all :stuck_out_tongue:
