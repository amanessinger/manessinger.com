Wow, this was a hard-to-ptocess image. What can I say, I botched it
while shooting. On the other hand, that's the only exposure from
that position and I want to keep it.

I didn't want to rotate it too much, because I needed both sides. In
the end I used Photoshop's "Edit / Transform / Skew". It took three
attempts over the course of a few months, but now I am willing to
accept it. It still looks wrong, but much less wrong :smiley:
