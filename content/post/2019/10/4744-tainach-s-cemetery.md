I'm just hearing an album by [Lyambiko](https://www.lyambiko.com/),
a German jazz singer. The album is a mix of American standards and
German songs, most of the songs from roughly the same period, the
1930s.

It's interesting: the American music of that time has defined the
music of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The German music is almost
exotic with a negative connotation: Nazi music.

Which is wrong, but still. It's hard to under-estimate how a lost
war, and especially the war of such a shameful r√©gime, distorts a
culture for generations.
