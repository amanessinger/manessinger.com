Sure, some images lend themselves strongly to black and white, some
less so. In many cases you can go either way. You get different
images developed to different characters and moods. It all depends
on what mood **you** are in.

Personally I lean to color. It's the way I see. And when I happen to
create something in black and white nevertheless, and if it pleases
me, I might try it more often and a short series of black and white
images may develop. And then it ebbs off.
