I'm writing this on the train to Vienna. Today is Sunday, September
29, Austria's general elections are over and the result was
surprisingly positive. In my opinion, at least.

The Green Party is back in parliament, with a whopping 14% and their
best result ever. Sebastian Kurz' populist "New People's Party" (the
old conservatives in disguise) has won the expected landslide
victory, the Social Democrats have been decimated for basically
nothing, and the extreme right Freedom Party got their well deserved
punishment.

The Freedom Party was the reason why we ran into early elections at
all. Two years ago, the party's leader and his deputy were invited
to the spanish island of Ibiza, seemingly by the niece of a russian
oligarch. In their talks, Mr Strache, the party leader showed an
unprecedented openness for corruption.

Strache basically offered the country's biggest newspaper and
massive business opportunities in government projects in exchange
for money for the party and illegal financing of election campaigns.
They consumed lots of alcohol and there were tracks of white powder
on the table.

Unfortunately - for Mr Strache - it was a trap. Seven hours of video
were taken, and some of the juiciest scenes were finally published
by two german newspapers in May. Mr Kurz' government fell, and since
then the stream of scandals around the Freedom Party did not cease.

It turned out that Strache, quickly replaced as leader, allegedly
had lived a luxury life on party funds, official and unofficial. For
a party that sells itself as the stalwart and honest defender of the
common people, this did not run down too well. Still, in the end 16%
gave their votes for a party of compulsive liars, corrupt zombies
and nazis -  and I mean "and", not "or" :smiley:

In the end we have an interesting situation. Kurz can choose from
three partners for his next government: again the disgraced Freedom
Party (which people wouldn't understand), the Social Democrats (they
hate each other from decades of paralyzed coalitions) and the Green
Party.

None of these possible coalitions looks like an easy win. All those
pairings are unpopular in both parties' electorates. The People's
Party would have preferred the neo-liberals, basically a modern
version of themselves, but the Neos are too weak.

Greens and Social Democrats would prefer each other, but even with
the Neos in a challenging coalition, they would not reach a
majority.

The Freedom Party has almost begged for an extension to their former
coalition with Kurz, but, apart from themselves, nobody can imagine
them in a government any more.

I see interesting times coming.
