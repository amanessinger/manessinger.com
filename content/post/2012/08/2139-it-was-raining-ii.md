Michael visited yesterday and left again late this morning. When I brought him to the railway station, it poured down like it since has most of the day. I needed some bread, and so I decided to drive to one of the super markets that are open on Sundays during the tourist season. 

 What I expected was to have trouble to find a parking lot, but that turned out to be painless. What was painful though, was to get out of it again ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "It Was Raining" from the 2003 Devil Doll album "Queen of Pain". We already had it in "<a href="/2011/06/1694-it-was-raining.html" target="_blank">1694 â€“ It Was Raining</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP0Plw3NHik" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
