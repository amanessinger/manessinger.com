Heavy rain had been predicted, heavy rain fell.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120831_174457_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120831_174457_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Basically it rained all day. I didn't even bother to go out. The two images were taken at and from our terrace.

Btw, I have bought a new device, a Network Attached Storage system (NAS) with four hard drive bays. I have installed 4 drives with 2 TB each, configured in RAID 5, thus it gives me about 5.5 TB effectively. That's more than I need for a long time.

 At the moment I am not sure how I'm gonna use the device. The first plan was to make a backup of my two image drives, slightly more than 2 TB. And here I encountered a problem.

 It was slow. Damn slow. 10 MB/s slow. Pretty exactly 10 MB/s.

I knew that the NAS was not fast, but the 10 MB/s strongly pointed at my network. And really: the LAN switch in my ADSL modem / router is only 100 Mbit/s, which gives you a net speed of pretty exactly 10 MB/s, protocol overhead included. Ouch!

I didn't want to replace the provider-supplied modem and bother with Internet connection settings, thus I just deactivated WiFi, placed a Netgear WiFi Gigabit router behind, and now data rates are at 30-40 MB/s. 

 Still not fast, but excatly what I paid for. This will cut the time for a full backup from 47 hours down to about 15 hours. Pretty OK, given that all other backups will be incremental. 

So far I can recommend both devices highly.

The Song of the Day is "Drop Down Low" from the 2003 De-Phazz album "Plastic Love Memory". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0oG1kHaE8Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
