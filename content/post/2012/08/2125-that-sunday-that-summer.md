A rather stressful weekend, but in the end I managed to get to our place at lake Keutschacher See and swim a round.

 Here's a view back across the meadow towards the entrance of our place. I loved the pattern of the shadows on the grass.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/natalie_cole/that_sunday_that_summer.html" target="_blank">That Sunday That Summer</a>" from Natalie Cole's tribute album to her father "Unforgettable: With Love".
