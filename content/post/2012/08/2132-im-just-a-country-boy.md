The first thing I did this morning was to process another one of yesterday's images. This kept me relaxed, I knew, if all else failed I'd still have an image for today's post. It turned out out I wouldn't have had to worry.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120819_164052_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120819_164052_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Driving to the lake I stopped the car near Rosegg, slightly before the power station that we had recently. It's just a place at the edge of the forest, situated in a double bend, an opportunity to hold the car, but only if you know the place. At normal speed it's normally too late to react. You see an interesting place from the corner of your eye and say to yourself "next time". 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120818_184428_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120818_184428_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, this time was it. After having driven by a few hundred times, I was finally aware of the spot in time, stopped and found - nothing. What had looked interesting from the corner of the eye looked plain when I stood there. But then, you have always the option to focus on the sun shining through the trees, or you just look up to the canopy and marvel at nature. Really, time and place are not so important, it's what you do there.

 The last image, the free standing tree in the pasture, framed by overhanging branches of the tree under which I was standing, that's the image taken yesterday.

The Song of the Day is surprisingly again by Jimmy Witherspoon. Hear "I'm Just a Country Boy" on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpk5DgldJEE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
