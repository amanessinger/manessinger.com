B+w is not my primary target. Never.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120810_185301_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120810_185301_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Sometimes I see an image, of course I take it in color, and whatever I do, it just doesn't work. Then it's often a good idea to try b+w. Not so here.

 I was absolutely satisfied with the color version when my mouse by chance happened to hover over Lightroom's "Blue Hi-Contrast Filter" preset. Normally I don't look at the miniature image in the "Navigator" palette, this time I did, and when I saw what the preset did, I was fascinated. I saw two entirely different images.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aimee_mann/how_am_i_different.html" target="_blank">How Am I Different?</a>" from Aimee Mann's 2000 album "Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo".
