I saw this girl's shoe today when I went home from work. I really had wanted to go directly to the train, but in the end I returned home and took a big paper bag with mostly empty lens boxes. As I said, I'll get rid of all my Nikon gear (with the likely exception of the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro), and as I already have most lenses in Carinthia, it is a good idea to have the boxes in the same place. Otherwise I'll never sell them ðŸ™‚

 For the second time the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_weller/pink_on_white_walls.html" target="_blank">Pink On White Walls</a>" from Paul Weller's 1995 album "Stanley Road". The first tiem we had it in "<a href="/2009/05/955-pink-on-white-walls.html" target="_blank">955 â€“ Pink On White Walls</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlgmFro0P7E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
