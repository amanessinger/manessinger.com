This was the first image that I took today, directly in front of the house. I was in a hurry and this mix of two very different reddish colors came convenient ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/how_deep_is_the_red.html" target="_blank">How Deep Is the Red</a>" (admittedly not that deep) from Elvis Costello's 2009 album "Secret, Profane And Sugarcane". I wonder why I've never used it, but probably it has not been available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj7P074waPk" target="_blank">YouTube</a> until now.
