Every time I drive to the lake for swimming, I pass by a church in Augsdorf, a small village, the church standing a little off the street, always tempting, but for some odd reason I've never been there.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120804_191647_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120804_191647_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It is a typical rural Carinthian church, nothing out of the ordinary, merely a nice specimen of the ordinary.

Yesterday I decided to make some images there. I had just left the car when suddenly the sun vanished behind a not so big but surprisingly stationary cloud.

 Well, I changed my mind and took photos of the cloud. The second image is of another cloud, an hour later, when I drove back from swimming.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/neil_young/change_your_mind.html" target="_blank">Change Your Mind</a>" from Neil Young's 1994 album "Sleeps With Angels". See and hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45qX1VYONds&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. It's almost a quarter of an hour but time well spent ðŸ™‚
