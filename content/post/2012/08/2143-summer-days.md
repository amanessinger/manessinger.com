This image is a week old, but it can perfectly stand for yesterday. After work I drove down to the lake for swimming, and although I managed to catch some last rays of the sun while swimming, for photography the race was lost.

 Heavy clouds, as predicted, rushed in from the west, pulling a cover over the sun and my inspiration. But then, that's what old images are for ðŸ™‚
