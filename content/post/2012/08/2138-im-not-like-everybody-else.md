Right? Wrong? Wrong!

I surely am. I see something that I like, I respond to it, in my case: I take a photo. Just like everybody else. 

I am not everybody else though, I am I and only I. What I see may have been seen by everybody else (like this incredibly popular view on the church of Maria WÃ¶rth), but just as I don't partake in everybody else's riches, I don't partake in their experiences. I must, may and can make my own.

 Iconic? Kitsch? Maybe for some imagined collective consciousness that does not bother me the least. This image may be the hundred thousandth version out there, for me it's the first. My version.
