Yeah, I know, the sun is male in English, but then, it was still female for Chaucer, just like it is in German.

 This is another image taken Thursday, I made no images on Friday. Well, actually I did, a one minute night shot of our terrace, lit by a full moon, but it's boring and just looks like in daylight ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window" from Joe Cocker's "Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen". Why not The Beatles? Well, they have sold out exclusively to iTunes (still no Beatles downloads from Amazon) and I don't link to Apple. Cocker is better anyway ðŸ˜„
