When I saw the two bikes cuddled together, I wondered how to best show the sense of unity that they gave me. 

Well, you know, only that the relation of two objects in three-dimensional space gives a certain impression to the viewer, does not necessarily mean that the same impression is obvious after projection onto a two-dimensional plane. This is the angle that I ended up with.

 Not completely perfect, the small wheel is slightly off center, but in glaring light, composing on the back LCD and being in a hurry, this is what was possible ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/x/xtc/hold_me_my_daddy.html" target="_blank">Hold Me My Daddy</a>" from the 1989 XTC album "Oranges &amp; Lemons". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzhY662xuFc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
