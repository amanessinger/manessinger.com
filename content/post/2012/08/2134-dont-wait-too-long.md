It's Wednesday evening, I'm on the train from Vienna down to Carinthia and it was just pouring outside. It's always pouring in Styria, the part of Austria that I have to cross. Styria is kind of the Ireland of Austria. There's a reason they call it Austria's "Green Heart" ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madeleine_peyroux/dont_wait_too_long.html" target="_blank">Don't Wait Too Long</a>" from Madeleine Peyroux' 2004 album "Careless Love". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTvpCep2QtE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
