As I've said a few times, Carinthia is famous for its wayside shrines. This is a pretty beautiful one that I discovered today.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120818_182325_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120818_182325_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Driving to the lake, this time coming not from Villach but from the other side, from Klagenfurt, Carinthia's capital, I saw this oak tree by a side road, a few meters from the main road. It was not standing freely, but I figured it would probably look good from below. Guess it does. As I already was in that side road, I decided to follow it, and that's how I finally discovered the shrine.

 Btw, two days ago I listed my Olympus E-P2 with EVF and 17/2.8 at eBay. It took five minutes and then it was sold for the "Buy It Now" price of 400 â‚¬. I guess I should sell more of my old equipment ðŸ™‚
