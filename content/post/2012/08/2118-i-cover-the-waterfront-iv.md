Oh how time goes by! It's already Wednesday and I have just sat down to write Sunday's post.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120805_195827_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120805_195827_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These are images taken shortly before sundown.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120805_200109_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120805_200109_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I have already shown some images of the place where I swim in summer, but most of them were taken standing at the shore or in shallow water, looking out on the lake. 

This time it's different, this time I wanted to show the shore and the wonderful reflections of the setting sun on the leaves.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120805_195647_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120805_195647_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Ideally one would have an air mattress or at least an inflatable pillow to rest the camera upon and to make sure it does not get wet. Lacking such an instrument, I had to find an alternative.

And it works marvelously. Not for a single second was there any danger for the camera.

 The Song of the Day is "I Cover The Waterfront", this time in the moody rendition of Terence Blanchard on his album "The Billie Holiday Songbook". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYVOZ7Ort1c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
