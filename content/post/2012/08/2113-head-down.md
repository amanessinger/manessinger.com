The river Drau is the main river of Carinthia. It runs through Villach and then, near Rosegg, it enters Rosental, the valley where I lived for more than 20 years.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120731_190156_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120731_190156_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Slightly west of that, at a power station, the river splits into what amounts to a canal and the old river bed. See the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=204121167874582797123.0004c63a0db13177de128&msa=0&ll=46.588527,14.006828&spn=0.030584,0.066047" target="_blank">left marker on my map</a> for the exact place where I stood and made yesterday's images. From there the old river runs down to Rosegg and in a loop back to the main stream, joining at the next power station.

You see a marker on the right side of the map, that's the bridge in Rosegg, from where, looking west, I've taken "<a href="/2009/10/1093-dream-river.html" target="_blank">1093 â€“ Dream River</a>" and some other images. 

The power station is hard to see from the road and not at all from the bridge, thus I've never noticed it until a few days ago.

Yesterday I finally went out to take some images there. I had not looked at the map beforehand, thus I didn't know exactly what to expect, but being there I found it quite interesting.

 What fascinated me most was a ladder down one of the steep walls. Instead of looking down myself, I just held the camera, pointing it down, composing with the tilted LCD. I didn't feel vertigo while I was there, but at least to me vertigo is induced by the perspective in the Image of the Day ðŸ™‚

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA9vLHZFrcs" target="_blank">Youtube</a>.

EDIT: <a href="http://jstrongphotos.com/VSBlog/" target="_blank">John Strong</a> made me try a B&amp;W version of the Image of the Day and I like it. Of course, as always, there's more than one way to do it. This is mine ðŸ™‚
