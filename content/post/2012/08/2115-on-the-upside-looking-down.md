Remember the power station in "<a href="/2012/08/2113-head-down.html" target="_blank">2113 â€“ Head Down</a>"? Well, I was back two days later, this time trying to find out if it's possible to get up on the wall.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120802_171114_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120802_171114_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> You see, it was. With the wall facing eastward, it would probably also be a good idea to try this spot early in the morning, but the late afternoon sidelight on the wall textures is definitely nice as well. Hmm ... let's see if I can convince myself next weekend ðŸ™‚

Alas some of the more interesting spots on the wall are not accessible. On the other hand, I can understand it, they don't want people falling down the wall or being mashed in the turbines ðŸ™‚
