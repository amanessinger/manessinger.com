Not that there is a general dearth of bicycle images on this blog, but we didn't have that many in the last weeks either.

I just saw the boy, his father was somewhere on the other side of the street, out of sight, and I hesitated, you know, photographing children has become pretty much of a taboo these days, but in the end I liked the image of the forlorn boy too much and I took it.

 The Song of the Day is "Low Rider's Blues" by Blind Willie McTell. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsMQA31r6Co" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
