Why this title? Really, I don't know. It's just an association that I had. 

 I had already seen this particular configuration of chimneys last week, and when I saw it again Monday morning and when I still had some minutes to spare, I mounted the Olympus 40-150 and snapped a series.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nina_simone/lonesome_cities.html" target="_blank">Lonesome Cities</a>" from Nina Simone's 1993 last studio album "A Single Woman". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q709r54-KGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
