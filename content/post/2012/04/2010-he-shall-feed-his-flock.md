We wanted to go to the circus today, but as it is already the third week, there were not enough people and the show was canceled.

 I got to see some animals  though. Somehow I love it how their humps rhyme with the tents ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day could have been "Wild Billy's Circus Story", but we already had that, and so we go two centuries back in time. William Christie's "Messiah" is and has always been one of my most favorite recordings of Handel's oratorio. Hear Andreas Scholl and Barbara Schlick on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9rw3RLv9AY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
