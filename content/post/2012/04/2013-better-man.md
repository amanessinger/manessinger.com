I've got a new camera and this will make me a better man and a better photographer and ... or will it?

Of course it won't. It's already back to normal. Customizing the OM-D was quickly done, because its menus are very similar to those of the E-P2. I could even keep <a href="/2012/04/2009-aint-heavy.html" target="_blank">my small bag</a>, I only had to rearrange the separator tabs to accommodate the hump with the viewfinder. There's even enough space for the small flash that comes with the OM-D. Perfect ðŸ™‚

 This image was taken from one of Villach's bridges, looking back to the center with the main church. This was Saturday around noon. Saturday the weather was much better than predicted, and in the afternoon I could even lie in the sun on our terrace.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/robbie_williams/better_man.html" target="_blank">Better Man</a>" from the 2003 Robbie Williams album "Sing When You're Winning". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OZlhDonTJM&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
