Today was a good day. An upgrade to Ubuntu 12.4 on my computer and an upgrade to Android 4 "Ice Cream Sandwich" on my Galaxy S2, and all at the same day.

  All went well with one tiny exception: my Kindle app on the phone had lost all its books in the process. No big deal, I just downloaded them again, but if you happen to have Android and an upgrade is available for you and you have not yet upgraded: heed their recommendation, back up your data ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/walkabouts/good_luck_morning.html" target="_blank">Good Luck Morning</a>" from the 1994 Walkabouts album "Setting The Woods On Fire". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHj3C6bghuo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
