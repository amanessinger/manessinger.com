Recently I bemoaned the fact that so many of my songs don't lend themselves as titles and that, apart from blue, color names are rare and most of the yellows are submarines.

 Well, who would have thought that I've never used "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/coldplay/yellow.html" target="_blank">Yellow</a>" from the 2000 Coldplay debut album "Parachutes"? Absurd but that's how it is ðŸ™‚

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdVAqxNLXiw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
