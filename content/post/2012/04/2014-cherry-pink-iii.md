Haha, just minutes after I made my <a href="/2012/04/2013-better-man.html" target="_blank">"back to normal" post</a>, <a href="http://oneowner.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ken Bello</a> commented on "<a href="/2012/04/2012-happy.html" target="_blank">2012 – Happy</a>", saying that <blockquote>the pressure is on now to produce great images</blockquote>No, it's not, at least I don't feel it. I just make the same pictures as I made with the Panasonic LX5 or with the Olympus E-P2, only that the new camera does some tricks that so far only the D300 could do. Exposure bracketing for HDR is such a thing.

 Well, in "<a href="/2012/04/2005-cherry-pink-ii.html" target="_blank">2005 – Cherry Pink II</a>" I said that "you can find thousands of images with pink blossoms on a blue sky background". Here's one more 😄

The Song of the Day is again "Cherry Pink”, aka “Gummy Mambo” or, in the version of Austrian brass superstars Mnozil Brass, “Gummimambo”. It’s from their 2004 album “Wenn der Kaiser grooved”. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxFwJxlAGW8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
