Well, I have no idea what the image would have to look like, but the best title for today would of course have been "2001 - A Space Odyssey". Alas no image lent itself, thus I just carry on with my current series of colors.

 Some tree's leaves are big enough now to cast shadows, and I really liked the effect on the wall and those red fins.

The image is from yesterday, not because I didn't take photos today, but simply because I like the image and wanted to use it. Maybe you'll get today's images tomorrow ðŸ˜‰

The Song of the Day is Eric Clapton's rendition of the Robert Johnson classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/theyre_red_hot.html" target="_blank">They're Red Hot</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRENNux7Q_Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
