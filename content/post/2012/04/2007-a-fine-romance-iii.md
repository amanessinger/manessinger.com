No rain today, no sun either, everything is dull and gray. I thought I could as well try the E-P2's "B&amp;W Art Filter". I did and in the end I decided to do my own conversion ðŸ™‚

 Well, I've also made some prettier images, but I found the sign together with the backside of this hotel rather ironic. Sorry, couldn't resist ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is one more time "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/a_fine_romance.html" target="_blank">A Fine Romance</a>", this time by Billie Holiday. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXray5quYXo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

Btw, I was surprised that I have used the song not only <a href="/2009/11/1131-a-fine-romance.html" target="_blank">once</a> but <a href="/2011/06/1701-a-fine-romance.html" target="_blank">twice</a>, and both time for the same, completely different subject.
