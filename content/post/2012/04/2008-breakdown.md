Broken roof tiles in a container in front of the neighbor house. I suppose the yellow spot is some thermal isolation material.

It's mid-April and there's still no trace of the Olympus OM-D. Well, actually there are traces all over Asia, but nothing here. Not that I can't await it, but I am happy that I did not follow my original resolution to sell the E-P2 by mid-March. 

I've really come to like this camera. It's not as fast as I'd like, it has some user interface quirks, but in general it works very well and very reliably so. Even changing lenses feels much more natural than it ever did with the D300. Everything is small and I literally can change lenses while walking. With the Nikon I always had to put one lens down, detach the other from the camera, put it down as well, take the new lens, attach it, ... 

 Here I have the camera in one hand, secured by a hand strap, the two lenses and the back cover in the other, and I can do it all all without ever needing a table or anything to put something down. OK, I have big hands, but it's amazing anyway.

The Song of the Day is the Tom Petty cover "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_petty/breakdown.html" target="_blank">Breakdown</a>" from the 1980 Grace Jones album "Warm Leatherette". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guldNfDwRxc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
