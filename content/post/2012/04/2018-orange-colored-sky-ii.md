Here's yesterday's sundown, orange painted on a blue sky. Art? No, not really, at least not my own ðŸ™‚ 

 I've omitted the white border and the image links to a full-size version. Feel free to do as I did and use it as a wallpaper.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nat_king_cole/orange_colored_sky.html" target="_blank">Orange Colored Sky</a>" from Natalie Cole's tribute album to her father "Unforgettable: With Love". Hear a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekaBInhlSz4" target="_blank">live version</a> on YouTube, and while we're at it, you may know it but I didn't, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wHNySlNyuM" target="_blank">Lady Gaga</a> performed it also and I like it as well.
