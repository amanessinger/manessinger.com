It was much cooler today and it will cool down even more. Rain is predicted for the Easter weekend. This doesn't bother me, I had plenty of sun these last weeks and the earth really needs it.

 This afternoon I walked through one part of Villach that I rarely visit. It's interesting how locally centered we live our lives. On days like this, when I get out rather late, I like to explore such parts of the town unknown to me. You may well see more images during the next days. Yes, yes, I know, <a href="/2012/04/1992-tanglewood.html" target="_blank">I'm a wimp</a> ðŸ˜„

The title of the Song of the Day is &ndash; by chance &ndash; another color. After yesterday's "Yellow" it's "Green" today. Here's Shirley Horn on the 1993 release "Light Out of Darkness (A Tribute to Ray Charles)". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A4wbSStIyI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
