After all that rain we had an incredibly clear day.

 I took this image of Villach's most iconic landmark, the mountain "Mittagskogel" ("Noon Mountain" because it is exactly south of Villach at the border to Slovenia), using my Sigma 150/2.8. It'a an unwieldy combination, but on the Olympus E-P2 this lens really excels. I didn't have to lug the lens around either, I just stood on our terrace.

The Song of the Day is "Misty Mountain Hop" from the 1971 fourth Led Zeppelin album. I've already used it in "<a href="/2009/08/1045-misty-mountains.html" target="_blank">1045 â€“ Misty Mountains</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUvkxz1nHMM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
