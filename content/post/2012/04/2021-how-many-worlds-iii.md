Using a long lens with very shallow depth of field (this is the Sigma 150/2.8 wide open), especially when focusing near, gives you a unique view into a world that you normally don't see: a world of mystery, of fantasy, and the fascinating thing is, that it changes completely every time you change focus.

 You look at a thin slice of reality, and everything in front or behind vanishes in a mysterious veil.

By the way: the RAW Converter of the Day is Lightroom 4.1 RC2 ðŸ™‚
