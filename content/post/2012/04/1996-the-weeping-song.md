Today, on April 4, Tonto has passed away. He was the most wonderful, the most lovely cat in the world. He was our cat. He was a charming coward, a joker, a lover and our most beloved.

I like to stress the fact that I don't believe in gods or afterlives, but when death strikes, it is so incomprehensible and so cruel, that despite of all my denial I can't help but wish him to eternally lie on soft pillows, basking in the warm sun. He is in our hearts and there he will always be, together with Lambda, who left us the year he was born.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nick_cave_and_the_bad_seeds/the_weeping_song.html" target="_blank">The Weeping Song</a>" from the 1990 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album "The Good Son".
