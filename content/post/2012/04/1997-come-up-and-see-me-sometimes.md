This image was made on the same afternoon walk as "<a href="/2012/04/1995-green.html" target="_blank">1995 â€“ Green</a>". I wanted to post it yesterday, but then Tonto's death changed my plans.

 Although I made some images yesterday, today I didn't. We had rain most of the day and it's supposed to go on like that for two more days.

The Song of the Day is "Come Up And See Me Sometimes" by the great Ethel Waters. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me6-E1bO_Yg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
