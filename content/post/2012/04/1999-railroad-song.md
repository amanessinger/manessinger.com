It's again cool and rainy, again I serve you leftovers, and this time the theme is "railway".

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120403_170414_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120403_170414_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> And the first image is already an exception. It's one of those pass-along images that happen when I suddenly see a pattern, a light effect or whatever. People may have wondered why I take an image of the side of a truck, but really, wondering what people may think is the direct way down the drain. Just don't do it ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120320_120027_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120320_120027_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, at least the truck stood in front of Villach's main railway station, thus I've decided to include the image.

The small bridge over the railway track is outside of Villach, the image was taken two weeks ago on one of my trips to see the doctor. Since then it has been waiting and today is the day ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120403_170716_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120403_170716_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Both the Image of the Day and that of the red locomotive have been taken from the same road bridge across Villach's main station area, the one with the locomotive facing east into the station, the Image of the Day looking west, into the late afternoon light.

All images have been taken with the Olympus 40-150, except the Image of the Day, that was the optically much superior 45/1.8.

You may have noticed that I haven't used my Nikon F mount primes in a long time, and in fact the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro is a much sharper lens than the slow 40-150, but in this case there was plenty of light and I was not out for subject isolation. To the contrary, both the locomotive and the railway tracks cry for depth of field.

 Still, I expect to use the Nikon F lenses much more often with the OMD, once it's there, and that's because focusing and composing with long lenses is much, much more convenient with a stabilized preview/viewfinder. That's what the OMD has and that is one of the features that I await most eagerly.

The Song of the Day is the "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lynyrd_skynyrd/railroad_song.html" target="_blank">Railroad Song</a>" from Lynyrd Skynyrd's 1975 album "Nuthin' Fancy". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bxIuX8I2Mg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Hmm ... probably not the refrain, but the rest of the song could have been by the Stones as well ðŸ™‚
