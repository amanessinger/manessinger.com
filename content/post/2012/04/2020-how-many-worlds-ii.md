The Olympus 40-150 is a cheap lens and it is not a macro lens, but using it near minimum focus distance is pretty nice, and even more so with the new viewfinder stabilization of the OM-D.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120428_163022_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120428_163022_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I made these images yesterday afternoon, under a bright sun burning from the sky, thus even though the lens is slow and the blossoms moved in the breeze, shutter speed was high enough to freeze any motion.

We have kind of a heat wave at the moment, after taking these images I was swimming in the lake. The water is still pretty cool, but it's already warmer than in October when I swam the last time ðŸ˜„

 Just as in "<a href="/2008/05/561-how-many-worlds.html" target="_blank">561 â€“ How Many Worlds</a>", made ages ago, the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/brian_eno/how_many_worlds.html" target="_blank">How Many Worlds</a>" from Brian Eno's 2006 album "Another Day On Earth".
