We have unpleasant weather again today. Around noon, when I was shopping, it just didn't rain and I made this image of the side wall of a shopping center.

 At reduced size the image is impossible to display without considerable moir√©, thus I have linked to the full size original.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dexys_midnight_runners/there_there_my_dear.html" target="_blank">There, There My Dear</a>" from the 1980 Dexys Midnight Runners debut album "Searching for the Young Soul Rebels", easily one of the best albums ever recorded. Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npZFHthhq54" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
