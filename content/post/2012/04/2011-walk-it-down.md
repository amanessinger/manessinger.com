I really ought to show you Keith, but it's late now and I don't want to process another image. Tomorrow maybe. Tomorrow it's supposed to rain anyway.

 This image just happened. I wanted to take an image of the bicycle, and then that man walked into the frame. I could have waited until he was gone, or maybe release the shutter with the guy right in the middle.

I did both, and because the second image was just a tad sharper, the Image of the Day is a composite of the two versions.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/talking_heads/walk_it_down.html" target="_blank">Walk It Down</a>" from the 1985 Talking Heads album "Little Creatures". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3oRS1-VDLQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
