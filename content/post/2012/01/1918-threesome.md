We had snow on Tuesday and I had a day off. When I saw these guys, they were obviously involved in a lively discussion. I didn't want to disturb and went on..

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/melissa_etheridge/threesome.html" target="_blank">Threesome</a>" from Melissa Etheridge's 2007 album "Threesome". See her perform on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_LW4vBxBuk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
