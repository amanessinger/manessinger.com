Working with the Sigma 150/2.8 on an Olympus PEN feels slightly unbalanced. It's a very capable combination though.

I used only the 150 and the results were few and mostly mediocre. These two are the best. I guess I could get used to the angle of view, but due to the heavy weight and the slow process of focusing manually, it's probably too tiresome to be worth it, except for very special occasions when I need a fast, long lens. Hmm ... I guess that means never ðŸ˜„
