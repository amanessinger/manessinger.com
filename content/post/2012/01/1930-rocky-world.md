I don't know why, I just use the LX5 again and I'm happy with it. Sharpness and resolution are OK, tonality is something you can work on in Photoshop (high contrast snowy landscapes are always a challenge), and when I look at this image, I can't help but be satisfied - <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/understanding-series/everything_matters__it_is_all_about_the_small_details.shtml" target="_blank">although it's not from a medium format back and although it has not been taken from an expensive tripod with an even more expensive head</a>. It's fine anyway ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/daniel_lanois/rocky_world.html" target="_blank">Rocky World</a>" from the 1993 Daniel Lanois album "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_beauty_of_wynona" target="_blank">For The Beauty Of Wynona</a>". You know, the one with the censored photograph by the great <a href="http://www.saudek.com/en/jan/uvod.html" target="_blank">Jan Saudek</a> (if you follow the link, be aware that much of the content is not safe for work). Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgPWiwPvWes" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
