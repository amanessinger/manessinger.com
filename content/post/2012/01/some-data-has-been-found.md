Hi everybody. Last night I've managed to get at the current data of my blog, i.e. the contents of the MySQL database. Of course restoring from the dump does not restore the images. Thus you see the posts but not the pictures, which is admittedly awkward for a photoblog.

This is still not my server, I suppose as soon as JustHost has their record straight, they will switch back to the the correct server, and that server will also have the pictures. Everything done on this server (including this post) will be lost, thus commenting is still turned off.
