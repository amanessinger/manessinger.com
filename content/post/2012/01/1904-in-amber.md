You think that's a funny bokeh? You're right, but otoh it's what makes the image. This is a detail from a very dirty red car at night, wet with dew. I kinda like it.

 The Song of the Day is "In Amber" from the 2000 Lowgold debut album "Just Backward of Square". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4jWlRfDa6k" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
