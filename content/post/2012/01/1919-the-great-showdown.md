Gordon had tracked down that robot for weeks and now he had him cornered. Things were not so easy though. Maybe he should have called out for reinforcements first, but now it was too late. He had to face this metallic monster all alone ...

Well, I'm reading Asimov, no doubt, and although the robot in my little fantasy is probably going to violate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics" target="_blank">First Law</a>, it is not so uncommon. Think of it: They didn't send robots into Fukushima, as everybody had expected, but on the other hand, military ponders the use of robots for securing borders. First Law is not in fashion these days.

  The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billy_joel/the_great_suburban_showdown.html" target="_blank">The Great Suburban Showdown</a>" from Billy Joel's 1974 album "Streetlife Serenade". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qwEtA_yx-g" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
