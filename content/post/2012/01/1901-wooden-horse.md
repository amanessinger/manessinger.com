Looks uninviting and overly minimalistic as a children's playground? Well, it is mandatory in Austria to dedicate a certain percentage of the total area of newly developed housing estates as playground, and obviously this is taken pretty lightly by the investors.

 Try to imagine you're a child again. Think back. How would you feel on a lonely horse, right in the middle between a fence, a power pole and the garbage containers? Mind you: this was take with a wide-angle.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/suzanne_vega/wooden_horse.html" target="_blank">Wooden Horse</a>" from Suzanne Vega's 1987 album "Solitude Standing". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZyD9igjyNE">YouTube</a>.
