I've been in Carinthia one day earlier today, because I had to bring the car to a car repair shop. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120120_152812_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120120_152812_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The appointment was for 8:00, thus I started out early and also made some images. The Image of the Day with its perfect alignment of moon and the mountain Mittagskogel was one of them.

I used ISO 640 and by accident I kept ISO at that for the whole day. That's the kind of stupidity that you end up with when a camera does not have reasonably intelligent auto ISO ðŸ™‚

 Oh, by the way, you may remember that I wished Nikon would implement auto ISO in a way that takes focal length into account. Good news: wish granted. Bad news: so far only on the D4 ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/annie_lennox/fingernail_moon.html" target="_blank">Fingernail Moon</a>" from Annie Lennox' 2007 album "Songs Of Mass Destruction". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrPancpNJQ0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
