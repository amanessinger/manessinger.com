Well, don't worry, that's not about me. It's just that the title seemed to fit.

 Why those colors? No idea. Probably because automatic white balance on the PEN does not produce good colors with the Nikon 24/2.8 AI-S, at least not in bright sunlight. Whatever. I fiddled around for some time, did strange things with color layers and blending modes and opacity and masks and ... and this is what I ended up with. Doesn't look completely wrong to me.

The Song of the Day is "Lost & Defeated" from Sarah Blasko's 2010 album "As Day Follows Night". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vybwS3sfh0A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
