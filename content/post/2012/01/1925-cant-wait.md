This is where the LX5 meets its physical limits. ISO 320 is not much, but this image was fairly pushed in the shadows and it shows. 

 The image was taken in 16:9 aspect ratio and after processing I had already uploaded it, but somehow it felt unbalanced and didn't satisfy me. I reconsidered, cropped heavily from the bottom, and as an extreme panoramic it suddenly works. In a way ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/cant_wait.html" target="_blank">Can't Wait</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1997 album "Time Out Of Mind". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4ItV7hO4O8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
