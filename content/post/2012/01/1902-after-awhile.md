Images taken with shallow DOF (this one with the Nikon 50/1.2 AI-S wide open) are always a playground for your imagination. No, these are not tombstones in an old cemetery, but they could be. Or anything else.

 I have just finished Garth Nix' "Shade's Children", a sci-fi novel set in a clever variation of the all-too-familiar post-apocalyptic world. After the "Change" there are no adults any more. Children are raised in prison-like dorms, and at their fourteenth birthday, aka "Sad Birthday", they are taken away to the "Meat Factory", their brains and flesh to be used as raw materials for creatures used in war games of the "Overlords". This is a book about the fates of four escapees who join the rebel group led by the artificial intelligence Shade.

 In the sci-fi genre, "Shade's Children" is innovative just as Garth Nix' "Abhorsen" trilogy was in the fantasy realm. And it captures you. Took me three days through the book, last night I went to bed at 4:30, five hours later I was reading again, and at 11:00 it was done  ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "After Awhile" by Jack Teagarden with Bud Freeman & His Famous Chicagoans. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPn4uYFBCeE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
