I took and processed these two images on Wednesday, but I didn't manage to write the actual blog post. Yesterday was not better, thus here I am, two days late, writing from the train to Carinthia.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120125_092653_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120125_092653_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> At the moment I'm pretty occupied with a new project. Our company will move to another part of Vienna, pretty much across from where I live now, and thus I'll move as well. I've already found an apartment in a house that's being built right now and that will be ready in about a year, just when I need it. From there it will be only a five minute slow walk to work. Contrast that with 50 minutes on two underground lines, and that twice a day. Adds up to a lot of life time ðŸ™‚

 Now I have to decide about options, colors, tiles, floors, where I want to have electric outlets,etc, and all that greatly depends upon how I'm going to furniture the apartment. I have some pieces that I want to take with me, but of course things like a kitchen have to be custom-built. Thus I've spent almost a week now creating a 3D model with <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Sketchup</a>, trying to get feeling for the size of the rooms and how I'll be using them.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/all_down_the_line.html" target="_blank">All Down The Line</a>" from the 1972 Rolling Stones album "Exile On Main Street". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LzgoRyxxVY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
