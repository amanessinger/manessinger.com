The last time that I used this title was in summer 2010, and that time it was <a href="/2010/07/1373-hanging-around-ii.html" target="_blank">laundry hanging from Italian windows</a>.

 This time it's a bike that I saw yesterday, and even if you don't like this image, for instance because you think that selective color really got old ages ago, it still touches an interesting question: Does this image infringe upon someone's copyright? I saw it, I took it, I processed it, but <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/2012/01/25/Imitated_Image_Copyright_Case" target="_blank">how can I know</a>???

Sick? Oh yes.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/stranglers/hanging_around.html" target="_blank">Hanging Around</a>", originally from the 1977 Stranglers album "Rattus Norvegicus". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si2kis6lWRg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
