My time was extremely limited today. I spent countless hours with Google Sketchup, and when I realized that time was running short, I grabbed the LX5 and took the car, venturing into the unknown parts of Villach.

 By all means, this image is stretching the dynamic range of the LX5, and yes, there is some noise coming up in the shadows, but then, this is, among other techniques, a composite of two versions from the same RAW, two EV apart, thus I was surprised by how well it turned out. And, by the way, did I say this camera is light ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is the Cream classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cream/train_time.html" target="_blank">Traintime</a>" from "Wheels Of Fire". Enjoy it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdxxSBVwRYg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
