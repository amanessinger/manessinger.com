Although I've made a few images on Tuesady, none proved to be really usable. I may try to take one of them again next week though. 

 Instead I show you one more image from my walk in a rainy styrian park ten days ago. I have a few more, but I guess you've already seen the best.

The Song of the Day is one more time "Walking In The Park" from the 1971 Colosseum album "Live". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5PpGlZsnlg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
