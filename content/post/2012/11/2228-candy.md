I had a terrible day today, a lot of work that essentially came to nothing, and what's even more frustrating, it will go on like that tomorrow. But let's forget about that, let's talk about real problems ðŸ™‚

I've been selling Nikon gear for a while now, and the two Panasonic pancakes have been sold as well. So far I've sold for about 3500â‚¬, even 4000â‚¬ when I include the Olympus E-P2, and there is still a potential for about 3000-3400â‚¬. What to do with that money? First world problem? You guess. 

But really, all that money would not suffice if I wanted to buy every desirable MFT lens currently available. It really shows how good MFT is as a system.

I have contemplated the VoigtlÃ¤nder Nokton 25/0.95, but that is a big, comparatively heavy lens that can only be focused manually and that does not cooperate with the camera at all. I have tried focusing manually with Nikon AI-S lenses mounted via an adapter, and honestly, I don't like it. 

The coming Olympus 17/1.8 is a lens that I will buy, even if reviews are a very mixed bag indeed. I will also need the Panasonic 7-14/4, or there won't be any more <a href="/2011/02/1595-frozen.html" target="_blank">images like this</a> ðŸ˜„

Olympus is supposed to bring a 40-150/2.8 sometime next year. I guess I'll want that as well.

As much as I have wished for a 12-35/2.8, now that it is available, I really don't care for it. I'd probably care for the 35-100/2.8, but if I can get a 40-150/2.8, I'll gladly take the Olympus. Why should I want a stabilized lens for a stabilized body? Stabilization adds just one more part that can break.

It will be a good idea to save some money for the next body (that one will come for sure), but there is still one lens that I may be interested in, and that is of course the Panaleica 25/1.4. I guess that will be my next purchase. Desirable, available and I have the money. Deadly ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_nutini/candy.html" target="_blank">Candy</a>" from Paolo Nutini's 2009 album "Sunny Side Up". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3xYXGMRRYk&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

Btw, the young man has not made anything new since then. Somehow that makes me nervous ðŸ™‚
