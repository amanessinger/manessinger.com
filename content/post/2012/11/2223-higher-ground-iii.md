Saturday I was driving from Carinthia to Styria, its eastern neighbor. The highway avoids the first of the two mountain chains in between, but it crosses the second one at a height of almost 1200 meters. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121117_121705_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121117_121705_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Just before the highest tunnel, the fog gave way to sunshine and I decided to take the exit to the old pass road, trying to look for a side road that would lead me up to sunny meadows amid frost-covered trees.

And really, I was lucky, a small road went up the mountain into a frosty forest.

Inside of the forest it was as if snow would fall, and at the same time the sun came through. Magic!

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121117_121751_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121117_121751_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's interesting how rarely we follow our dreams and desires. I have crossed that pass so often, quite a few numbers in the same weather conditions, frequently wondering if I should take the exit and explore the area. Until now I never did.

 Like yesterday, the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/barbra_streisand/higher_ground.html" target="_blank">Higher Ground</a>", but this time interpreted by Barbra Streisand on her 1997 album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYkrIB_P3n0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
