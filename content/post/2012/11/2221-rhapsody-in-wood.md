No images made today, sorry. I've refactored a lot of code, made a resolution to buy the Olympus 17/1.8 (see <a href="http://robinwong.blogspot.com/2012/11/olympus-mzuiko-17mm-f18-review-street.html" target="_blank">Robin's review</a> to know why), and I have sold two lenses and my Nikon macro flash kit. I guess this is enough for one day ðŸ˜„

 The Image of the Day is from last Sunday. I took it with the excellent Olympus 75/1.8, wide open at f1.8. A pretty unusual way to shoot landscapes, but beautifully rendered by this remarkable lens, it works well for me.

The Song of the Day is "Rhapsody In Wood" by Woody Herman. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Ngl8BsswI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
