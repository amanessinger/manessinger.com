The last time that I've used this title, it was in Spring and for a <a href="/2012/03/1991-in-the-morning.html" target="_blank">sunrise in Villach</a>. Technically it was made in urban area as well, although that was not obvious.

Today it was in Vienna and completely off nature, but some golden November morning light can easily make you forget about that.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/norah_jones/in_the_morning.html" target="_blank">In The Morning</a>" from Norah Jones' 2004 album "Feels Like Home". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL6hEhpDYBo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
