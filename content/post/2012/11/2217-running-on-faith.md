This image pleases me mightily, in just the same way and for similar reasons as "<a href="/2012/11/2210-stardust-ii.html" target="_blank">2210 â€“ Stardust II</a>" does. Both have been taken with what Mike Johnston likes to call the "<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2012/11/d800e-haptics.html" target="_blank">World's Most Perfect Lens</a>", the Panasonic Lumix G 20/1.7 ASPH.

This was the last image that I have taken with that lens, I'm going to sell it.

Why? Why would anybody sell the World's Most Perfect Lens? 

Well, I've seen some images taken with the upcoming Olympus 17/1.8, due in December, and as far as I can tell, it is not a bit worse than the 20/1.7. To be honest, it is not better either, but it is an Olympus with the same kind of build as the 12/2.0.

I want it. I need it. I will get it.

And then? 12, 14, 17 and 20mm? Seriously?

Nope! The two Panasonic pancakes will go, and while I'm at it, the Olympus 40-150 will go as well. This frees two slots in my shoulder bag (the tiny 14/2.5 had already been crammed into a pouch meant for storage cards). One slot will take the 17/1.8, the other one the 60/2.8 macro.

 Still, selling the 20/1.7 while the 17/1.8 is not yet available means, I'm running on faith. But then, what else can a poor boy do? ðŸ˜„
