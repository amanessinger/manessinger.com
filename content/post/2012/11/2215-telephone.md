It was foggy until noon today, but when the fog dissipated, a bright sun in a blue sky was revealed. That was about the time when some problems crept up at work.

I had originally intended to do as I did yesterday, to take an hour or two off while the sun was bright, but instead I was swamped until four, and then the sun was already gone. What a pity.

I currently have the <a href="http://www.ebay.at/itm/281014883280?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649#ht_500wt_1414" target="_blank">Nikon 50/1.2 AI-S up on eBay</a> and I'll have to ship it on Monday. Thus I was at the post office and bought some more boxes. In front of the post office, just before I went back into the car, I saw this phone booth. The impulse to take the image was the same as with the <a href="/2012/11/2211-listen-learn-read-on.html" target="_blank">two blackboards a few days ago</a>.

 Sure, the OM-D does not have the same dynamic range as a Nikon D800E and the Olympus 12/2.0 is not as fast as the mighty Nikon 35/1.4G, but then, <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2012/11/more-experiments-on-the-virgin-mary.html" target="_blank">Mike may enjoy holding 1.5 kg in his hands</a>, I actually prefer slightly more than a third of that. Oh yes, and for the lesser quality at high ISOs I make up with the shutter speeds enabled by this camera's excellent in-body image stabilization. How about half a second? Handheld ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Telephone" from Captain Beefheart's 1980 album "Doc At The Radar Station". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjHuiV3DPGo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
