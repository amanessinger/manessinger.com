We had a lot of rain here in Carinthia last weekend, and the next weekend is predicted to be equally wet, but at the moment we have wonderful autumn weather.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121108_134141_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121108_134141_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Today I was working, but when after some stress in the morning I hit a spot where I had to wait for other people, I figured I could as well take two hours off and go photographing. 

I took the car and headed for a church on a hill, but when I saw the golden leaves of a forest not far from home, I stopped to take a few images. It turned out to be a good idea, because when I had finished, a veil of thin clouds began to blunt the bright sun and the colors grew dull. Still, I was satisfied, and instead of driving on to the church, I returned and continued working.

In my opinion two of the images make for pretty neat wallpapers, thus I have omitted the usual white border. One of them, an image I had to crop vertically anyway, now even comes in two formats, 16:9 and 16:10. 

 I have linked the thumbnails of the wallpapers to the versions on my Flickr stream. As usual, all images on my photostream are available in original size.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/golden_autumn_day.html" target="_blank">Golden Autumn Day</a>" from Van Morrison's 1999 album "Back on Top". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73PrxdAfZ2A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
