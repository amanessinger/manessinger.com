Sometimes I simply forget where I live and how privileged I am.

Remember the last post? I had posted an image from last weekend, because it was foggy and gloomy all day and I had no desire to go out and take images.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121116_151740_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121116_151740_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, we had the same situation on Friday, but this time I took two hours off in early afternoon and drove up Dobratsch, one of Villach's two nearest mountains.

What a difference it was. At about 1200 meters the fog started, and somewhere above 1500 meters it gave way to bright sunshine. Really, you can't imagine what a difference in mood it makes.

 The Image of the Day was taken in the same place as "<a href="74 â€“ Out of the Fog" target="_blank">74 â€“ Out of the Fog</a>" and 
"<a href="/2010/02/1210-solid-rock.html" target="_blank">1210 â€“ Solid Rock</a>", only this time I was just a tad below the upper limit of the fog.

Like in "<a href="/2009/01/810-higher-ground.html" target="_blank">810 â€“ Higher Ground</a>", the Song of the Day is one more time "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/vanessa_williams/higher_ground.html" target="_blank">Higher Ground</a>" by Vanessa Williams, and this time I can link to a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2B5ZwYdtv0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

By the way, nice number of this post, ain't it ðŸ™‚
