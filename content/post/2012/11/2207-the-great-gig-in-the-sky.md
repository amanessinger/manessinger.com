Interesting: about two weeks ago I forgot to mention that this blog had its sixth anniversary. Six years, one image per day, not always taken that day (but mostly), not always posted that day (but frequently).

 Today we had a mix of rain and snow, it was cold and unfriendly, thus I have tried to stay inside. The Image of the Day was taken from the terrace and most of the time I have spent photographing Nikon equipment to put it up for sale. It's tedious ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is a blasphemous Reggae version of Pink Floyd's "The Great Gig In The Sky", taken from the 2003 album "Dub Side Of The Moon". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiDC3GUdrCI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. And if you can't stand it, there's always the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3zwKgz8hsI" target="_blank">original</a> ðŸ˜„
