The motto "one image per day, shot that day" had always implied "posted that day", and I am afraid this has not been true in a long time. Basically I tend to pile up posts from Monday to Wednesday, posting them when I am on the train to Carinthia. 

 So it is this week, here's the post for Monday, an image shot Monday night in front of a garden center in Vienna. Something in the arrangement of the two blackboards appealed to me.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/deep_purple/listen_learn_read_on.html" target="_blank">Listen, Learn, Read On</a>" from the 1968 Deep Purple album "The Book of Taliesyn". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IMhvRn4_r8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
