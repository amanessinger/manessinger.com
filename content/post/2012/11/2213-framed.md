In a way it always surprises me how much I like fixed longer focal lengths. It surprised me with the Sigma 70/2.8 on the Nikon D300, it surprised me with the Olympus 45/1.8, and it surprises me now with the Olympus 75/1.8. Somehow I always expect to have a problem with the narrow field of view, but really the opposite is true: I greatly enjoy walking around, seeing through this small frame, cutting details out of a big scene.

 Apart from this simple pleasure, this image is also a good example for the fantastic image stabilization of the OM-D: I wanted some depth of field, thus I've stopped down to f8. Doing that on a gloomy day either forces ISO up or shutter speed unreasonably down. I chose the latter, and at an equivalent focal length of 150 mm, I happily held 1/13s and got a perfectly sharp image. Scary, huh?
