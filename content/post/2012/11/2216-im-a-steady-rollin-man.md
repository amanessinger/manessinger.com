In <a href="/2012/11/2215-telephone.html" target="_blank">the last post</a> I've shown you an image taken with the Olympus 12/2.0, handheld at half a second. It was perfectly sharp.

 Today's image is sharp, but not as sharp as the lens can do. Still, it's at least as sharp as most lenses can do. One third of a second, handheld, with the Olympus 75/1.8. That's 150 mm effective focal length. Cool, huh?

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/robert_johnson/im_a_steady_rollin_man.html" target="_blank">I'm A Steady Rollin' Man</a>", the Robert Johnson classic, interpreted by Peter Green and Nigel Watson with the Splinter Group, taken from their album "Hot Foot Powder". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRGaQOT7ouI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
