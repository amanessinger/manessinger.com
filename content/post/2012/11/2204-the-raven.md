We have "normal" time again, the days have become extremely short. This is an image that I took on Monday. A sign post at a tramway stop in KaiserstraÃŸe in Vienna's seventh district.

 The Song of the Day is "The Raven" by Lou Reed. Yes, THAT raven ðŸ™‚

Well, it's not exactly a song but excellent nevertheless. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrys8knY53I" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
