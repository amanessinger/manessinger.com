You see me pretty satisfied with this lens. The Olympus 75/1.8 clearly restores my ability to produce shallow depth of field. It's different, I still have to get closer than I had to with, say, a Nikon 85/1.4, the working distance is longer than with most fast lenses that I had for the Nikon system, but I suppose you agree, the result is not worse at all.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/deep_purple/shield.html" target="_blank">The Shield</a>" from the 1968 Deep Purple album "The Book of Taliesyn". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swZQdVem5TY&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
