Like all past weekends I've been in Styria again, and like all past weekends I have made images there and failed to post them ðŸ™‚

 I'm going to make up for it now, while sitting on the train back to Vienna. This time I'll stay till Friday again.

The Image of Saturday is a bunch of dead leaves on a grate. They are the stuff next Spring's greens are made of, and that's how the endless cycle goes.

In <a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/reed_lou/endless_cycle.html" target="_blank">his song</a> from the 1989 album "New York", Lou Reed speaks of another cycle though. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKaYF_TcYzE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
