Yes, this day went on like the last had ended. I really love being successful, not merely documenting my defeat, but that's what happened today. 

When I had finished working (or rather given up), I just wanted to go out and make some images. I did, no big inspiration came my way, but I soon began feeling much, much better.

 "Shutter Therapy", that's how <a href="http://robinwong.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Robin Wong</a> calls it, and he's right ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Dazed And Confused" from the self-titled 1969 Led Zeppelin album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auDv6cf2PBM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Oh, and: Music helps as well ðŸ˜„
