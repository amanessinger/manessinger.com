I was pretty sure I wouldn't make any images today, but when I went to the car to drive back to Carinthia from Styria, the moon's lightness in relation to the sky was exactly right. I just couldn't resist.

 For the second time, after a rather awful "<a href="/2007/09/351-moon-is-mine.html" target="_blank">351 â€“ The Moon Is Mine</a>", the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/fairground_attraction/the_moon_is_mine.html" target="_blank">The Moon Is Mine</a>" from the Fairground Attraction debut album "The First Of A Million Kisses". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKH3evjgkBc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
