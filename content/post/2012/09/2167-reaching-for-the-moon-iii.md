Today's weather is cloudy with some high fog, it's cold and does not look promising. Astronomically summer's gone and it also feels like that. 

I've decided I won't take images today, I have work waiting for me anyway. Here's a Thursday moon for you.

 Like in "<a href="/2009/03/873-reaching-for-moon.html" target="_blank">873 – Reaching For The Moon</a>" and in "<a href="/2010/04/1268-reaching-for-the-moon.html" target="_blank">1268 – Reaching for the Moon</a>" (the mountain in the latter is also Mangart, as in today's image) the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/reaching_for_the_moon.html" target="_blank">Reaching For The Moon</a>", but today it is not Holly Cole, today it's Ella Fitzgerald. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvjEC7fEcEI&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
