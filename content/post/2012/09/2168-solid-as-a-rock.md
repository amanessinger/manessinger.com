Today the conspiracy theory that DXO rides a vendetta against Olympus just crumbled.

You may remember, ages ago, maybe even two months ago, DxO posted on their DxOmark site that the Olympus OM-D E-M5 was "strange". People wondered what that could mean, and when no review by DxO happened in a long time, suspicions arose.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120924_010041_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120924_010041_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> All needless. Today <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/News/DxOMark-news/Olympus-OM-D-E-M5-The-best-of-the-micro-4-3-cameras" target="_blank">DxD published data on the OM-D</a> and, according to them, the OM-D is just a little bit better than the Leica M9 and as good as the Canon 7D.

Of course this is rubbish. I mean, it may well be so, but even if, it is more or less meaningless. The OM-D is just "Good Enough<sup>TM</sup>" and that's sufficient.

Today I read a question on Photo.net, a question of someone who asked if going from DX (APS-C) to FX (35 mm frame) would help with his landscape photography. No, I answered, it would not. FX is fine for shallow DOF (which you don't need in traditional landscape photography) and high ISO (which you don't need either). I also mentioned that I had gone in the opposite direction, from Nikon DX to Olympus OM-D and ... was ignored ðŸ™‚

Anyway. I think the direction things move to is clear, but that's not even my point. For me the OM-D is all about weight and image stabilization.

 Take for instance today's images. Both were taken with the Panasonic 20/1.7, a lens that is something between a moderate wide-angle and a so-called "normal length".

Both of these images were taken in extremely dim light, both were taken with shutter priority ("S-mode") and both were taken at 1/3s. Handheld.
