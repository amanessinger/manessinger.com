Monday. This is in a place I pass by almost daily and it's the at least second attempt to take an image there.

 The Song of the Day is "Lets Talk About Us" by Van MorrisonÂ´and Linda Gail Lewis, taken from their collaboration album "You Win Again". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu2dcFfUP-8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
