Yesterday I got a contact request on Flickr from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bengt_carlsson/" target="_blank">Bengt Carlsson</a>, a photographer from Sweden. As usual, before making him a contact myself I had a look at his images and ... was totally struck!

I've never experienced anything like that before. There is someone who obviously thinks and feels about images exactly like I do. It's almost spooky to see images that you totally agree with, to a degree that you wonder if you've taken them yourself. So many images that I see and, had I been in that situation, would have taken myself, and not just the subject but also the composition. It's even a very familiar sense of humor. 

You know, there are thousands of ways to make a photo in a particular situation. Some choose this, some choose that, but it's odd to see how someone regularly takes that way that you yourself would go. It's a strange feeling of brotherhood, and again, nothing that I've ever experienced before.

And he's a very good photographer as well. But just see for yourself and at least browse through his "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bengt_carlsson/sets/72157621030526111/" target="_blank">Own Favorites</a>".

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/captain_beefheart/the_thousandth_tenth_day_of_the_human_totem_pole.html" target="_blank">The Thousandth And Tenth Day Of The Human Totem Pole</a>" from Captain Beefheart's final album "Ice Cream For Crow". It's pretty peculiar like most of his work, so let's say this is one for the refined taste ðŸ˜„
