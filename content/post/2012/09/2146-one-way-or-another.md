I took this image today shortly before noon. I should probably have waited. It's mid-afternoon now, the rain has stopped and a timid sun comes out. Oh, wait, it's gone again, so maybe this image is OK ðŸ™‚

 I've omitted the white border because I have used it as a wallpaper. As always, the full size of the image is on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/7913445062/sizes/l/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. 

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/blondie/one_way_or_another.html" target="_blank">One Way Or Another</a>" from the 1978 Blondie album "Parallel Lines". Music from my youth, more powerful than I had remembered. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFerLNdpwO4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
