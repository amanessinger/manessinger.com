It would have been pretty hard to choose any other title. I have not even tried ðŸ™‚

Finally this is an image taken today. I stopped working one hour earlier, using the bright and sunny day to go swimming. Those opportunities will be rare soon.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/the_long_and_winding_road.html" target="_blank">The Long And Winding Road</a>". We already had the Beatles version in "<a href="/2008/01/458-long-and-winding-road.html" target="_blank">458 â€“ The Long And Winding Road</a>". This time it is interpreted by Italian singer Mina on her album "Mina Canta I Beatles". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqICvTxUZFM&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. 

And while you're there, why not hear into my most favorite version of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kivY8BEjsyo&feature=relmfu" target="_blank">Hey Jude</a>"? I heard the song on a gas station north of Florence, Italy, and that's what made me buy the CD. Oh fond memories!
