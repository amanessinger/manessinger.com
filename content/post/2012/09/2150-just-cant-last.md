Tomorrow noon I guess I'll take two or three hours off.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120906_191848_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120906_191848_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Today I have worked until 5:30 pm and then waited an hour more before I finally got out. The problem is, I've expected a package and DHL failed to deliver.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120906_192001_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120906_192001_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The contents? A small light tent with two spotlights included. I'll use it to take images of the lenses that I'm going to sell.

When I left home at 6:30, I fully intended to go swimming. I just wanted to head over to the computer store and buy a WiFi repeater first. I did that, I was back to the car as quickly as I had hoped, but it was already too late for swimming. The days are already painfully short. Well, not winter-short short, but short nevertheless.

 In the end I headed for a place where I knew the sun would last slightly longer, hastily took some images, and that was it. Thus it will be swimming at noon tomorrow ðŸ™‚
