Here's an image taken Monday afternoon in Vienna's seventh district, the center of alternative lifestyle.

 I'd really love to have an image without that cup, but when I tried in a second attempt, a woman arrived by bicycle and slowly began to fasten it to the railing. I was in a hurry and couldn't wait, thus we have to live with the cup ðŸ™‚

Just like in "<a href="/2011/08/1758-the-pink-cart.html" target="_blank">1758 â€“ The Pink Cart</a>", the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/cartwheels.html" target="_blank">cartwheels</a>" from the 2004 Patti Smith album "trampin'". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1WlmTN3Rck" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
