Weather was predicted to be bad and bad it was indeed. The mountains around Villach are all snow-capped, I'd estimate the snow to go down to about 1700 meters. That's pretty bad for mid-September ðŸ™‚

 We had rain down here, I just left the apartment to buy some food and my new Asus/Google Nexus 7 tablet. 

Yes, I know, I didn't need one. It's just so, so ... enticing ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„

In reality I don't even have a use for it. The preliminary plan is to learn programming for Android. Somehow I'm interested in sexy direct manipulation GUIs for boring corporate back-end systems. Maybe it's only to stay in touch with current technology. It's so easy in my job lose the connection to not only the bleeding edge, but if you don't take care even to the mainstream. Suddenly you end up being the equivalent of a Cobol programmer ðŸ™‚

 Of course I did not take images today. Not a single one, but here's one taken yesterday instead. It looked unbalanced in color, but using B&amp;W and lightening up the blues extremely did the trick. Suddenly I had a nice distribution of tones to play with, instead of a dark blob on the left side.

The Song of the Day is "A Little Bit Later On" by Ella Fitzgerald. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSLqSE4g9vg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
