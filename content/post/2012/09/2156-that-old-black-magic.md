Today is Wednesday, it rains and I am on my way down to Carinthia. Weather for tomorrow is predicted to be bad, but other than in Vienna it will likely recover during the weekend. I expect to be swimming again the next days.

Today I didn't make any photographs, thus I'll show you one more from the series in "<a href="/2012/09/2151-wild-water-blues.html" target="_blank">2151 â€“ Wild Water Blues</a>". Somehow I just love how far you can go in black and white without breaking the image. Here I have pulled back the highlights as much as possible, lightened the shadows, darkened the sky, and it all still looks natural. Do that to the same extent in color and you've got all sorts of problems.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/that_old_black_magic.html" target="_blank">That Old Black Magic</a>" from Ella Fitzgerald's "Ella In Rome - The Birthday Concert". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWTyLkeWTgw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
