I suppose you know those places. Places you pass by so often, frequently thinking you should stop the car and take a photo, but you always drive on, because there's no place to stop.

 This was made in such a place, a shed on a patch of land between a highway exit, the highway, the big street that the highway exits into, and ... the small street that I took today and where I finally was able to stop and park the car. It's a strange place, a remnant of the past between all those new traffic lanes. An anachronism, almost as unreachable as the past of our memories. Almost.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/somewhere_in_between.html" target="_blank">Somewhere In Between</a>" from Kate Bush's 2005 album "Aerial". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HiDZ1MqWo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
