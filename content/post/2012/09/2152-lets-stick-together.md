Well, I should write intelligent and witty things now, but instead I am only very, very tired. Spare me the effort, will you, please ðŸ™‚

 This tree caught my eye in the morning.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/lets_stick_together.html" target="_blank">Let's Stick Together</a>", today in the interpretation of Bob Dylan on his 1988 album "Down In The Groove". Funny, I never liked the album, but now that I hear it again, I have no idea why ðŸ˜„

All instances of this song on YouTube are "blocked in my country", but the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B6DC43X5IU" target="_blank">whole album</a> is not. Funny, huh?
