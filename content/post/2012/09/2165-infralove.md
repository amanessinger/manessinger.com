Between Photoshop CS3 and Lightroom 4.1 the guys at Adobe have improved their faux infrared B&amp;W conversion a lot. 

Of course this is not only fancy curves applied, this is negative clarity and faux grain as well - and it works.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120921_172749_lr_plain.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120921_172749_lr_plain.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I wouldn't go as far as to claim that this looks like the "real" thing, but that isn't at all important to me either. What is important is, that it pleases my eyes and that it doesn't look faux at all. 

 Btw, the toning is not part of the standard effect, that has been added by me.

Why at all? Sorry, I don't know. I just tried what I never try - and it worked ðŸ™‚
