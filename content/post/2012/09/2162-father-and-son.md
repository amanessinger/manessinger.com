In reality it's Thursday night, but here on the blog it's still Tuesday.  

 In reality I've been working in Carinthia all day, here on the blog we are still in Vienna where I found this guy with his father, all life still waiting for him, still a promise, vague but sweet.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cat_stevens/father_and_son.html" target="_blank">Father And Son</a>" from Cat Stevens' 1970 album "Tea for the Tillerman". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFMbSa1MD9c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
