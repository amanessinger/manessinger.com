To be precise: it looks like Spring, it's warm like Spring, but I have that certain feeling that Winter will at least try a return.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120318_143805_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120318_143805_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It was mostly cloudy today, some patches of blue sky and short periods of sun, certainly not as beautiful as yesterday, but at least today I did go out photographing.

 It's not breathtaking what I returned with, but still, it's good to see green again, good to see blossoms, good to go with only a sweater.

The Song of the Day is "It Might As Well Be Spring" by Stan Getz. Hear the 1951 recording on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DibAb-RUgbE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
