Dammit! What a wonderful chance missed! Why couldn't Saturday have been one day earlier ðŸ™‚

Yesterday we were down in sunny Italy. To be hones, it was just as sunny at home in Carinthia, but there's still a feeling that the light is brighter in Italy.

 This image was made in ancient Aquileia, in Roman times an important city, today a sleepy town. I guess we'll see more of that in the days to come ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rickie_lee_jones/on_saturday_afternoons_in_1963.html" target="_blank">On Saturday Afternoons In 1963</a>" from Rickie Lee Jones' 1979 self-titled debut album.
