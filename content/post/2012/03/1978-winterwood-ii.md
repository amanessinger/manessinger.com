On a beautiful day like yesterday I wouldn't have expected this to be my only image made, but in the end I was mostly busy shopping, cooking, and in the end it was not even worth the effort. Cooking, I mean. I tried something, experimented, and although it was not inedible and although it was certainly nourishing, in retrospect I should have spent an hour taking photographs instead. 

 Well, you can't help it, that's just how some days are, but that's also what makes better days better days, right?

It's getting increasingly hard to find usable song titles that I haven't used before. This one first appeared in "<a href="/2010/01/1205-winterwood.html" target="_blank">1205 – Winterwood</a>", but I thought it would not be wasted on a stack of snow poles either. Don McLean sang it on the 1972 album “American Pie”. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RqJNpe6otk&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
