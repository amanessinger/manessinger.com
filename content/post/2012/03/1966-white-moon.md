I know, I promised more images from Italy and I've already processed and uploaded them. I will post them as soon as I'm in need for an image again, but for yesterday and for today at least I have images that I sufficiently like. 

 This is the cemetery of Meidling, a district in the south-west of Vienna. I had an appointment in the vicinity, and instead of taking the Underground straight home, I decided to catch some late light on the graves. The moon was definitely a bonus ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "White Moon" from the 2005 White Stripes album "Get Behind Me Satan". A great match if you ask me, but hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7XywuICl64" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
