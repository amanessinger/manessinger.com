Here's one more image made yesterday. Although I drove to the Doctor's once more, today I was in a hurry and didn't have time to make a single image. It's a real pity, because until noon we had a clear, bright and sunny day.

Turns out the Helleborus niger of yesterday are also called Christmas Roses in English, and that I already knew that when I wrote "<a href="/2008/02/498-where-wild-roses-grow.html" target="_blank">498 â€“ Where The Wild Roses Grow</a>" four years ago. Here's where I made yesterday's image.

I like this image, because it pretty much looks like I wanted it to look, like I saw it when I was there, only that the JPEG from the camera was blown out in the background. It's only natural, it was around noon in bright sunlight and the contrasts were extreme. 

 This is a merger of two versions from the same RAW, along with some Photoshop magic to better balance the distribution of tones and contrasts. Surprisingly enough the RAW held full detail in the background, yes I even had to desaturate the roof of the building in order to make it less dominant.

To be honest, I wouldn't have thought that the E-P2 has enough dynamic range for such a trick, but really it does.
