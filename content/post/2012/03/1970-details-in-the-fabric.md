This is one of the few images made today, looking at and through a mesh, through the window of the Underground, in a place where the Underground is not under ground.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jason_mraz/details_in_the_fabric.html" target="_blank">Details In The Fabric</a>" from the incredibly good 2008 Jason Mraz album "We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things."

This album is also a reason why I don't buy plastic any more. I bought the de-luxe version with bonus disc, only to find out that my copy, while indeed coming with two CDs, had two identical copies of the main disc. Well, I didn't bother to return it ðŸ™‚

Hear the Song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdIw6tEjyEg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
