Not much of an achievement, but I think in post-processing I almost made something of this drab shot.

 But still, it was nothing until I fond the title, and in the end I'm satisfied, even if it's mostly for the fact that I can present you a glorious 2009 performance of this song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUTPsRJ6e2k" target="_blank">YouTube</a> ðŸ™‚

One of the comments there is "<em>and on the eighth day God made Bruce...</em>". 

Amen, brother!
