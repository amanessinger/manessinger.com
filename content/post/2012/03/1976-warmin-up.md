I left work early today. I was tired, weather outside was gorgeous, and when I looked down on the street and saw the pattern of the reflections on the buildings across the street, I simply had to go down and take a picture. The old man seemed to enjoy it as well.


The light I mean, not me taking a picture ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Warmin' Up" by Roy Eldridge. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z1FN-KUHXw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
