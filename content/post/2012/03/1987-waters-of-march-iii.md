Today I was back at Lake Ossiach, this time in Ossiach on the southern shore. 

Ossiach has a monastery and originally I went there for architecture, but in the end the most interesting images were of reflections in the lake. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120326_154348_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120326_154348_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> For the Image of the Day I made generous use of my <a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/artistic_license.shtml" target="_blank">artistic license</a>, at least as regards colors, the other one is pretty as it was ðŸ™‚

 As in "<a href="/2011/03/1601-waters-of-march.html" "target="_blank">1601 â€“ Waters Of March</a>" and "<a href="/2011/03/1609-waters-of-march-ii.html" target="_blank">1609 â€“ Waters Of March II</a>" the Song of the Day is "Waters Of March".

Weather you prefer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5esq7Z2C2kI" target="_blank">Cassandra Wilson</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQj0dWr9Vs" target="_blank">Holly Cole</a> is a matter of taste. Both give this Antonia Carlos Jobim composition a distinct touch.

 You rather want to hear the master himself? No problem, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFGQtGJZto8&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has that as well.
