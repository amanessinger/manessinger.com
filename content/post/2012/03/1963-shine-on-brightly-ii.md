We had lousy weather this week and only this afternoon the sun came out. I took this image when I left work today. 

 I'm still a little bit slow with the 45/1.8, but then, I have hardly taken any images during the last days. Apropos slow: I really look forward to the OM-D, because the E-P2 focuses extremely slow with this lens. It works, but it is not a pleasure.

Like in "<a href="/2010/03/1261-shine-on-brightly.html" target="_blank">1261 â€“ Shine On Brightly</a>", the Song of the Days is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/shine_on_brightly.html" target="_blank">Shine On Brightly</a>" from the 1968 Procol Harum album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E12YAuAYjLQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
