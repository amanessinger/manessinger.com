There are still 26 more posts to go, but Wordpress informs me that, due to a number of administrative posts over the years, this is post #2000 on this blog ðŸ™‚

 Back again to bicycles. It was a dull day, but from tomorrow on the sun is supposed to come out and we shall meet an early Spring. Let's see, I won't have much time before the weekend anyway.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/suzanne_vega/straight_lines.html" target="_blank">Straight Lines</a>" from Suzanne Vega's self-titled 1985 debut album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jVzJYgz68" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
