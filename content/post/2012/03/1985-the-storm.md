Today I was pretty satisfied with the idea to take one of yesterday's images, the fence with the yellow stone and post. I knew I wouldn't have much time for photography and I didn't have a problem with that. After all, there are still some images from Aquileia, Italy waiting to be posted, two others taken this week, and I really could use a break as well.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120324_184207_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120324_184207_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's supposed to stay warm and sunny, only today some rain was forecast and rain we got. Not as much as the thirsty earth would need, but enough to give us an interesting spectacle in the sky.

 More than three hours are between the Image of the Day and the rainy day sunset. Both images have been taken from our roof terrace, the first with the Olympus 45/1.8, the second with the Panasonic 20/1.7.

At first I was not sure if I should take them at all. I mean, from the terrace? And what's the subject anyway? Turns out I very much like them both; like them for the light, like them for showing how it was. After all: that IS a quality ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "The Storm" from Marcia Ball's 2003 album "So Many Rivers". Great music, hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7fuWzatydo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
