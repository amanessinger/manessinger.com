I've been in Velden today. Velden is a townlet at the western end of Wörther See, with a length of about 20 kilometers Carinthia's biggest lake. Originally I was there for reflections. You know, that kind of reflections as in "<a href="/2012/03/1987-waters-of-march-iii.html" target="_blank">1987 – Waters Of March III</a>".

 I may have something along these lines and I may post it later, but somehow I can't help but post the image that I post. 

In Austria the hare is a symbol of easter as much as the egg. This café in Velden is decorated with both.

The Song of the Day is obviously "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/easter.html" target="_blank">Easter</a>" from the 1978 Patti Smith album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2lSyE86qM8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
