The weather was slightly overcast most of the day and I really had no intention of going out photographing. When it cleared up in late afternoon, I couldn't resist though.

 This image more or less happened. I stood there, not even half convinced, taking an image of the landscape, when suddenly this girl ran into my view. I was lucky and in the end I think it became quite a nice Spring picture.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/corrs/so_young.html" target="_blank">So Young</a>" from The Corrs' 1999 "Unplugged" album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8rUZHbsnUQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
