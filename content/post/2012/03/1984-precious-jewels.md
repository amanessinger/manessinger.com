Here are three pictures that I made yesterday. I had taken the chance to get out for two hours, and the plan was to take images of a certain fence.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120323_154800_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120323_154800_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I did so, and when I already wanted to drive home, I suddenly saw what you see in the Image of the Day:

Another tattered fence leading to a group of bushes, and below them there was a multitude of small white flowers. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemone_nemorosa" target="_blank">Wood anemone or windflower</a>, BuschwindrÃ¶schen in German. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120323_152953_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120323_152953_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> To make the image, I had to go down on my knees, below the twigs. What you don't see in the picture is the incredible number of spiders down there. It's beautiful, but from the perspective of an ant it must be very much like Mirkwood ðŸ™‚

 Of the images of the original fence only one remained. Normally I would have been tempted to keep it for today, but then ...

The Song of the Day is "Precious Jewel" from the 1997 collaboration of Charlie Haden and Pat Metheny, "Beyond the Missouri Sky". See them perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar-CmypmRNg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
