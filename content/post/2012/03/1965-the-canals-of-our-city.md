Here are two more images from Aquileia, down in sweet Italy, It's not far from home and it's almost by the sea.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120303_140558_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120303_140558_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In fact once, in Roman times, it was, but since then the big northern Italian river, the Po, has deposited enough sand to cut Aquileia off. There's still a yacht harbor though, connected with the Mediterranean by canals.

 Yesterday's trip to Aquileia was my first outing with the complete kit, consisting of the Olympus E-P2, the 14/2.5, 20/1.7, 45/1.8 and the 40-150. I've bought a small Sony shoulder bag that can take all five pieces, at least as long as I have one of the pancakes mounted and the EVF taken off. Pretty convenient, about 1 kg of weight and no size.

On that short trip I have made use of all four lenses, at least one of the images taken with the 14/2.8 will follow soon.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beirut/the_canals_of_our_city.html" target="_blank">The Canals Of Our City</a>" from the 2006 Beirut album "Gulag Orkestar". Amazing how well this music fits into an Italian setting. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcuKsH6GLY4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
