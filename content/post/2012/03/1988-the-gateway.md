I did go out today, but only to buy breakfast ðŸ™‚

 The Image of the Day was taken yesterday. It is an HDR of three exposures, taken handheld out of the entrance of the former monastery of Ossiach.

The Song of the Day is "Gateway" from the 1993 Henry Threadgill album "Song Out of My Trees". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPbJn-uThX0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
