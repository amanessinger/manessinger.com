"Non-Places" &mdash; I think the difference between a place and a non-place is pretty arbitrary and the term is a contradiction in itself. After all, even non-places are places, they only fail to get that recognition. When I do recognize it photographically, I try to convert a non-place into a place. 

Hmm ... it's all very complicated ðŸ˜„

As I said yesterday, non-places are fantastically useful artistic devices, exactly because they "<em>do not hold enough significance to be regarded as places</em>". They do not come with pre-attached meaning, they are vessels open and willing to accept any meaning I fancy to pour in. They are perfect raw material.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/shoplifters_of_the_world_unite.html" target="_blank">Shoplifters Of The World Unite</a>" by The Smiths. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fltYX-fI0Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

Oh, by the way, I took the liberty to remove a pair of price tags from the picture above ðŸ™‚
