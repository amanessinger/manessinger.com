Another good idea for what to do on a rainy or foggy day is taking images in shopping centers. It does not need to rain though. 

 It suffices that you are there anyway, for instance because in a sudden burst of inspiration it became obvious to you that a resolution of 1920x1200 is not enough and that TN panels just don't cut it. 

 Sure, such inspirations may later lead to inquisitive questioning and long discussions, but ... sometimes there's no way around that ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/patti_smith/whirl_away.html" target="_blank">Whirl Away</a>" from Patti Smith' 1997 album "Peace and Noise". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgjLTg4DaYw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
