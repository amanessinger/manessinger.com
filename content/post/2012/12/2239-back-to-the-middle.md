Here we have two images originally shot in B&amp;W, and that's also how they ended up on the blog.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121203_084902_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121203_084902_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image of the scooters was shot almost while on the run. Monday morning I was late, I finally missed the nine o'clock deadline at work by two minutes, but this image was not the reason. As I said, I made it almost while walking.

 The Image of the Day is different. Here it is night, I've just arrived in Vienna, it's 1/20s at ISO 1600, so you know it was dark ðŸ™‚

For obvious reasons the Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/indiaarie/back_to_the_middle.html">Back To The Middle</a>" from India Arie's 2001 album "Acoustic Soul".
