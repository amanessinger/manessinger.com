OK, today's images are a mixed bag. I could have thrown in some more, but let's leave it at that, it is late enough anyway ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121216_124502_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121216_124502_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The first three images were taken with the 75/1.8. Now that I am almost through with buying lenses, I can get back to actually using them ðŸ˜„

It is completely sharp at f1.8, actually sharper than most lenses at their best aperture.

I had the Panasonic 25/1.4 mounted, the camera set to B&amp;W, and even though it was foggy and dull, the pattern of the leaves immediately caught my attention. It doesn't have to be color all the time.
