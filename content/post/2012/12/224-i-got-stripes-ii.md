Using digital cameras didn't make me a B&amp;W person either. In reality digital cameras are color devices. Well, the Leica M Monochrom is not and some CCTV cameras are not, but whatever we normally buy is meant to take color images.

Of course we can convert to B&amp;W, many of us do, I frequently did in the past (or probably not <em>that</em> frequently), but there is some element of randomness in it. Starting with a RAW file you can simulate any kind of filter, any kind of development, and what you get is very much a function of your mood at the time you do the conversion, in fact much more than that at the time you took the image.

When I used digital SLRs I never saw B&amp;W. Granted, the same is true for HCB and his Leica, but at least for me it makes much of a difference how I see the image while I frame it.

And here we are. Electronic viewfinders make the big, crucial difference. Suddenly I see in B&amp;W, frame in B&amp;W, suddenly I deeply enjoy making B&amp;W images, and now the difference is, that I don't only enjoy processing color images to B&amp;W, but instead enjoy <em>taking them as B&amp;W</em>.

 Today's image is another one taken Wednesday in Vienna.
