Most of today I've spent refactoring one gigantic C# program, but in the early afternoon I took two hours off to get an image and stuff from the supermarket. The image was quickly done, but shopping was pure hell. It's that season, you know ...

 In case you wonder, this is a toilet wagon parked under a highway bridge ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_conte/dont_throw_it_in_the_wc.html" target="_blank">Don't Throw It In The W.C.</a>" from Paolo Conte's 1995 album "Una Faccia in Prestito". Wonderful music, you really got to hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ozLFRjkc0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
