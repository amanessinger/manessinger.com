I'm in Styria, it's December, the weather is bad. Very bad. Remember "<a href="/2012/10/2202-walking-in-the-park-i.html" target="_blank">2202 – Walking In The Park I</a>", "<a href="/2012/11/2208-wild-leaves.html" target="_blank">2208 – Wild Leaves</a>", "<a href="/2012/11/2209-stardust.html" target="_blank">2209 – Stardust</a>", "<a href="/2012/11/2217-running-on-faith.html" target="_blank">2217 – Running On Faith</a>" and "<a href="/2012/11/2212-walking-in-the-park-ii.html" target="_blank">2212 – Walking In The Park II</a>"?

Well, I was in the same park again, but now everything looks dead and almost completely drenched of color. Browns are to be had and it is wet and cold. Being asked what I wanted to photograph on a day like this, I hesitated for a moment and then said that I would set my camera to B&amp;W. And so I did.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121201_135851_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121201_135851_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> When importing the images into Lightroom, they show up B&amp;W for a short moment, but then Lightroom begins to render them in color, and when I saw the result, I immediately re-applied the B&amp;W "Orange Filer" preset - for all images but one. This one. Everything else looked better in B&amp;W. No wonder, the images had been seen and taken in B&amp;W.

The Song of the Day is "Stuck In The Middle With You" by Michael Bublé. Today there is no link to Amazon, because I was unable to find the song. It's on an extended extra version of the album "Call Me Irresponsible", and that version does not seem to be available any more. One more example for the bizarre ways of the music industry. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cA6uYpkDlDc" target="_blank">Hear it on YouTube instead</a>.
