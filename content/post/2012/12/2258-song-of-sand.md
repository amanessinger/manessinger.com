I really would have liked to take some images today. Even weather was passable, the only problem was my total lack of time.

 Therefore all you get is another image made on Thursday. It was taken at the frozen shores of river Gail, right around the corner ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/suzanne_vega/song_of_sand.html" target="_blank">Song Of Sand</a>" from Suzanne Vega's 1992 album "99.9 F". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4Ci1VrvD74" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
