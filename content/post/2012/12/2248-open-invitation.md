Wednesday I had to pass this park in the heart of Vienna, Volksgarten, and I found these signs on the open door gave me a confusing mix of informations. One of them says the park is open from 6:30 am to 7 pm, and the other tells me that "due to storm the entire park is dangerous".

 Fortunately I escaped the lure of the park, call me a coward for that, but at least I live to tell you of my adventure ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Open Invitation" from the 1993 New York Voices album "What's Inside". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crbpfmXd94s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
