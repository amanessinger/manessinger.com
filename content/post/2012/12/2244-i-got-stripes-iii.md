This is the post for Saturday, but the only image actually made yesterday is the one made on the highway.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121208_123253_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121208_123253_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Just like last weekend we had snow, only this time I couldn't avoid it while driving. 

The Image of the Day was taken in Styria today, for a change on a bright, cold, sunny day. You'll see more of that tomorrow.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121209_112301_lr_plain.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121209_112301_lr_plain.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> For today I have only this architectural pattern, and if you're interested in what the hell this is, I've uploaded a more conventional view for your illumination ðŸ™‚

I've worked with the 75/1.8 at f11, and still there was not enough depth of field. It's a compromise, but I really like the image.

 The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/johnny_cash/i_got_stripes_live.html" target="_blank">I Got Stripes</a>" from Johnny Cash' "At Folsom Prison" album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LRpCv7siI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
