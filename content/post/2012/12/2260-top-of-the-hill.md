We had the warmest Christmas Eve since the beginning of weather recordings in Austria. It didn't help though weather-wise, it was cloudy and hazy, but I didn't have much time for photography anyway.

 It was much better today, a warm, sunny day with bright blue sky, therefore you'll get two posts with today's images.

For some subjects an ultra-wide lens is best, churches on top of hills are frequently among them. That's what I bought the 7-14 for ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Top Of The Hill" from Tom Waits' 2004 album "Real Gone". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23sy-RGe4c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
