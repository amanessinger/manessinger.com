This is the same church as in the last post, this time taken from inside out. The main church is closed, this is really only a small anteroom, but of course at 7 mm and focused near, all proportions are greatly distorted.

 The Song of the Day is "Candlelights" by Bunny Berigan. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPw3XxVR6DU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
