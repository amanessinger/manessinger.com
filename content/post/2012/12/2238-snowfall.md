Well, this is funny. I began shooting in B&amp;W today, but after a few pictures I switched to color again. Finally this images ended up in B&amp;W again, although it is a more complicated conversion based on "Green Filter" and a few local and many global adjustments.

 You see, it's December and we have snow, Short sights, low contrast, so I decided to try my luck in a nearby forest. I like what I got.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/manhattan_transfer/snowfall.html" target="_blank">Snowfall</a>" from the 1992 Manhattan Transfer "Christmas Album". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WouGmkkXp4Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
