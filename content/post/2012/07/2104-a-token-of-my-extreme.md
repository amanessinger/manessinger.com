Today was just like yesterday: too cold for the season, rainy in between, and in the evening the sun came out.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120722_144137_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120722_144137_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These three images were taken early afternoon. It was just beginning to drizzle when I saw some trucks in a parking lot, each carrying amusement park equipment. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120722_144016_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120722_144016_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The bright colors were a welcome distraction from the otherwise dull vistas and so I took a series of images.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_zappa/a_token_of_my_extreme.html" target="_blank">A Token Of My Extreme</a>" from Frank Zappa's 1979 opus "Joe's Garage".

 I think it's amazing that it is not available as digital downloads, and even the CDs are only to be had at obscene prices. Can someone please tell the industry that keeping digital downloads in stock does not eat up warehouse space?
