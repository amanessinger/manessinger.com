I had a tough choice between those two images. 

Late yesterday afternoon I noticed that the moon was right above Mittagskogel, the mountain south of Villach. At that time the mountain was clearly visible but due to some clouds in north-west it was in shadows. I took some bland images and decided to wait until the setting sun comes out.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120729_195729_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120729_195729_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It did and I even managed to put myself into a place where I had the same constellation again. The moon directly above the mountain, slightly shrouded by clouds.

 Then I drove a little further, nearer to the mountain, and there I took what would become the Image of the Day. Although the constellation was very different now, I like the position of the moon as well. It's less margrittesque, more of a conversation between moon and mountain. What would you have chosen?

The Song of the Day is "When The Doom (Moon) Comes Over The Mountain" from Lester Bowie's 1981 album "The Great Pretender". Hear at least the beginning as soundtrack to what seems to be an ad for an apartment on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aDbro-Mq9Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
