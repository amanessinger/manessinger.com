All these images were taken on Tuesday, and they were taken along with a hundred other exposures.

Imagine me, sitting in the water, only head and shoulders above. There was no wind, hardly waves, but the motion of the water was still enough to make taking pictures a challenge.

Is enough of the sky in the picture? Is the sun in the middle?

My intention was to shoot as low as possible. In the two pictures with the ducks I already was at f11, and still I was getting only very little depth of field. Of course there was no way of getting ducks and background equally in focus, thus I settled for the ducks..

The sky glowed a little, the cloud pattern was interesting, but it never became really colorful.

 The Song of the Day is "Duck &amp; Cover" from the 2010 De Phazz album "Lala 2.0". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNyePSgP2Oo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
