Friday when I went to work it was raining. I took a few very low shots of colorful shops reflected in wet manhole covers. Don't know what gave me the inspiration, I just tried, and this is the image that I like best. Of course colors and contrast are pushed a little, but it's still not overly exaggerated. 

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/willie_nelson/rainy_day_blues.html" target="_blank">Rainy Day Blues</a>" from the 2008 album "Two Men With The Blues" by Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis. I've already used the song ages ago in "<a href="/2009/01/837-rainy-day-blues.html" target="_blank">837 â€“ Rainy Day Blues</a>", but really, it shows no wear ðŸ˜„ 

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdFsEGblqU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
