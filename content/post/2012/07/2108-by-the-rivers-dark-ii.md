I have no images for Thursday. Thursday was nothing but stress, the only images that I took were documentary, actually images of documents ðŸ™‚

It's funny, for me photocopiers are a thing of the past. Want a copy of some paper? Take an image.

 The Image of the Day, taken on Friday, is actually not of a river but of a fountain. Going near and wide produced the effect.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/by_the_rivers_dark.html" target="_blank">By The Rivers Dark</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 2001 album "Ten New Songs". We already had it <a href="/2009/12/1170-by-the-rivers-dark.html" target="_blank">a long time ago</a>. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3sBuolUkA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
