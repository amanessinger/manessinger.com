No images for today. When I went out, the sun was already gone. It was still nice weather for swimming, but for photography it didn't inspire me at all. 

 No problem, I have a lot of older images that I have not used on the blog. Here is one of them, taken at the same time as the one in "<a href="/2012/06/2068-here-it-is-again.html" target="_blank">2068 â€“ Here It Is Again</a>", only this time I used the 45/1.8.

 The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/here_it_is_again.html" target="_blank">Here It Is Again</a>" from the 1992 album "0898 Beautiful South". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5ys0S1g2N4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
