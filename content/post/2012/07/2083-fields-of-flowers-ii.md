It's hot, really hot, it's summer and photographically it's a rather silent time. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120701_100905_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120701_100905_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> At least I managed to take these images. It was around noon (did I say it was hot?) and I considered taking the images later in the evening. I'm glad I didn't, because when I passed the spot again in late afternoon, all the flowers were closed ðŸ™‚

 

The Song of the Day is one more time "Fields Of Flowers" from the 1984 album "Pure Fantasy" by Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe10cpnYdGo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
