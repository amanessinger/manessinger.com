I don't exactly know why, but this image made trouble. I tried to process it in Lightroom only, but after two attempts I gave up, took my best version over to Photoshop and finished it there. Sometimes choice is fine 🙂

 The Song of the Day is “Deep Forest” by Earl “Fatha” Hines. I have it on disc 77 and disc 136 of “The Ultimate Jazz Archive”, a great collection of 168 CDs full of classic Jazz. I got it for 99€ some years ago, and now I see it from an Amazon Marketplace dealers for $398.99. Oh well 🙂
