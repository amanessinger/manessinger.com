I really gotta catch up. It's already Friday and this is Wednesday's image. Every time I go swimming, I have to drive a narrow way through a small glade, and every time the sun shines through like this, I think I ought to capture this light-flooded wilderness. I never did.

 The image links to a full-size version without white borders. This is my current wallpaper. Try it, you may like it. I certainly do ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/manhattan_transfer/the_jungle_pioneer_viola_violar.html" target="_blank">The Jungle Pioneer</a>" from the classic 1987 Manhattan Transfer album "Brasil". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpUJbq3fc4w" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
