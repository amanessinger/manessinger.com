Late after work I went swimming, just in time to get some images of the setting sun.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120718_203013_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120718_203013_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I don't know why, but making this kind of image never tires me. This is so much summer and I love summer so much. Maybe it tires you seeing these images though ðŸ™‚

 Well, it was not really sultry. It has cooled down quite a bit and the rain of the past week has raised the lake's water level by about 20&nbsp;cm. The water is slightly cooler as well and that's fine.

Still, the Song of the Day is "Sultry Sunset" by Duke Ellington and his Orchestra. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyH5ye2xn38" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
