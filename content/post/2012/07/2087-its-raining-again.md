Yesterday morning I saw a thunderstorm in the west. It must have rained on the other side of Villach, but on our side the fair and hot weather held until I ... stopped working. Oh well!

 I didn't go swimming, I made only two images of the same subject and that was it.

The Song of the Day is "It's Raining Again" by Joe Williams and Count Basie. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9qavDaeXRM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
