No images today. And not only that I didn't make images in the morning, now, in the evening, it is also raining.

 The image was taken on March 3 in Italy. Yesterday we talked about uniformity. Well, some places are different and in some parts of Italy the mail boxes are not even boxes ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Moving" from the 1990 Redbox album "Motive". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgBcaf9pI_4&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
