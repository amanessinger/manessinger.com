This is a bad image, or at least it is completely irrelevant. I probably should use one of my spare images made yesterday, but then, it happens to other people as well.

Take for instance the good Mr Asimov. I just finished "The Stars Like Dust", the chronologically first of his "Empire" novels, a book that he himself considered his probably worst and, what shall I say, he was absolutely right ðŸ™‚

It's rare that a book of an otherwise good author is so complete and utter rubbish, a waste of time, a disgrace to the author's name, but unfortunately in this case it is all true. The plot is absurd, the characters are bad templates, everything is declared and nothing is shown. If you don't need to read it for any weird reason, do yourself the favor and skip it. It does not contribute anything essential to the history of the "Foundation" universe anyway.

 To add insult to injury, the book is even in conflict with the other books in how it explains Earth's radioactivity. Just forget it.

Last night I have started "Pebble In The Sky", last of the "Empire" books, actually the first one written. Let's see how this one turns out.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/martha_reeves_and_the_vandellas/nowhere_to_run.html" target="_blank">Nowhere to Run (Nowhere to Hide)</a>" from Ruby Turner's much criticized "Motown Songbook". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0G00Yl0cU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
