I'm on the train to Carinthia again, this is the post for yesterday.

While the image of the scooter has really be taken on Thursday, the Image of the Day is one day older. Somehow I liked it too much to fold it into Wednesday's "<a href="/2012/02/1947-the-lair-of-the-green-monster.html" target="_blank">Monster</a>" post, and I thought I might need it for Thursday anyway. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120216_082038_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120216_082038_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Fact is I didn't, the scooter with the red ribbon would have been OK as well. I could have postponed the image even further, on weekends for instance I'm frequently in need of an image, but then, I like it so much that I'm eager to get it out. 

 The Song of the Day is one more time "Waste Of Words" from the 2005 De-Phazz album "Natural Fake". I've already used it in "<a href="/2011/12/1891-waste-of-words.html" target="_blank">1891 â€“ Waste Of Words</a>" with an image taken at the same place. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qQZeZbLuFM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
