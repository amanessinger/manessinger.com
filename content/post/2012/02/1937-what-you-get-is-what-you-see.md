Today is Sunday and it began cold, sunny and beautiful, but I still didn't go out.

When I finally considered it, weather had deteriorated considerably, and instead of taking photographs, I finished "The Naked Sun" by Isaac Asimov ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120204_155357_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120204_155357_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I had two images left from yesterday though, two images that I like and that somehow didn't fit into the last post. Well, here they are, a look at some colorful ads through a snowy windshield, and a street sign that seems a little bit out of context.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tina_turner/what_you_get_is_what_you_see.html" target="_blank">What You Get Is What You See</a>" by Tina Turner. See the official video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0GVixJvt-g" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
