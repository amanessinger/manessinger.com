I'm on my way to Carinthia again. Until I left work, I had exactly zero images for today, thus I left some minutes earlier than usual, and in the end I had a handful to choose from.

 In the meantime I have finished Asimov's "The Currents of Space" and I've learned that his own chronology from the foreword to "Prelude to Foundation" is wrong: "The Currents of Space" is really the second "Empire" novel, "The Stars like Dust" is the chronologically first. Oh well, thankfully and in contrast to the Elijah Baley novels, the order in "Empire" seems to be not so important.

By the way, I'm on the train and we just cross the eastern alpine ridge. As so often there is an incredible sunset outside and not being able to make photographs is really, really irritating to say the least ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Li Ma Weesu (As In A Mirror)" from Youssou N'Dour's 2002 album "Nothing's In Vain". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyk2HxnIVUQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
