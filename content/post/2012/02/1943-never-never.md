Today we had something like snow most of the day. Not that it was really snowing, but it pretended to. Tiny flakes that amount to nothing, falling from a sky that never intends to keep its promise.

I was outside, made an alibi shot and then drove to the supermarket for the ingredients for dinner. No inspiration, not for photography at least. Dinner was fine ðŸ˜„

 The image was made in the morning, through the window of our study, through a fly screen, out on the terrace. It's not focused, so am I, and this is quite a pleasant state to be in. 

The Song of the Day is "Never, Never" by Dinah Washington. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACdnqMI1fU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
