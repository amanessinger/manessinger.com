Public phone booths are definitely a thing of the past. They still exist, but in an age of omnipresent cell phones, they look like the ultimate anachronism.

 Like Isaac Asimov's robots and Multivacs. Once they were a definite option, now we know that we have moved into a totally different direction.

Btw, I'm still reading and enjoying Asimov. From a pirated (because not available for sale) "Complete Robot" I have moved via "Caves of Steel" to "The Naked Sun", both novels bought (because available).

The Song of the Day is "I Wish I Were Twins" by Coleman Hawkins. See a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzVU9fad-B0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
