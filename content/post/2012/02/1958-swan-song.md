The sun is setting right now, it will be spectacular again, but I won't take images.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120226_122923_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120226_122923_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I went out at noon, to the center of Villach, and I took some images of swans on the river and of modern architecture along the shore.

In the end I processed five images, and I have decided to save the two architecture shots for another day. I like all of them and I wouldn't want to bury either.

For all of you considering the new Olympus OM-D E-M5,  I'd like to recommend a blog that I recently found, of someone who currently has the chance to actually hold and use this new camera. Yesterday Pekka Potka from Finland made some tests of the new <a href="http://www.pekkapotka.com/journal/2012/2/24/olympus-e-m5-5-axis-image-stabilization.html" target="_blank">5-axis image stabilization</a> (finding it impressive), and today he looks into <a href="http://www.pekkapotka.com/journal/2012/2/26/olympus-e-m5-dynamic-range.html" target="_blank">dynamic range</a> (with equally promising results). 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120226_123029_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120226_123029_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I suspect he is still under NDA regarding image quality, but maybe not. In any case I'm eager to follow his blog. It makes waiting a tad easier ðŸ™‚

 By the way, the OM-D's user manual is already <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_support_manuals.asp?id=1583" target="_blank">available for download</a>, for instance from Olympus' US site, although it does not look entirely finished. Bracketing specs are still dubious, but seemingly it will be possible to change aspect ratio with one of the function buttons. That's good news, because I miss it on the E-P2.

The Song of the Day is "Swan Song" from Marc Almond's 2010 album "VarietÃ©". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgoCKcBk1fI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
