The days get longer and on my way from work (I left early at 16:15) I was able to use the 40-150 for a few shots. When the light began to fade, I switched to the new Panasonic 14/2.5, and this is what the Image of the Day was made with.

 An equivalent focal length of 28 mm is only moderately wide, but the lens is tiny and I like that.

The Song of the Day is "Twilight Song" from the Charlie Haden / Kenny Barron collaboration "Night And The City". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s858XbdhWa4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
