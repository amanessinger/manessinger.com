I hope you didn't expect an image made with the new Olympus 45/1.8? Nope, although with 40 mm the focal length is not that far off. As I said yesterday, weather here is Vienna is severely lacking at the moment ðŸ™‚

 Last Sunday I had two images left that I didn't want to use <a href="/2012/02/1958-swan-song.html" target="_blank">along with the swans</a>, here's the first of them.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/jacobs_ladder.html" target="_blank">Jacob's Ladder</a>" from Bruce Springsteen's 2007 album "Live In Dublin". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb4Q2-GhfaU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
