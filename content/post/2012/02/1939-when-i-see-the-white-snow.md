The weather forecast for yesterday warned of a snow storm. It all sounded like some historic blizzard would bury the city under 15 feet of pure white snow.

 It did not happen. There is a tiny amount of snow and it's cold enough for it to stay. Nothing more.

The Song of the Day is "Quant je voi la noif remise (When I see the white snow)" from Gace BrulÃ©. Hear an instrumental version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZGFnGF6bu4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Oh my, I was surprised there's anything at all. Not precisely pop music, at least not these centuries ðŸ™‚
