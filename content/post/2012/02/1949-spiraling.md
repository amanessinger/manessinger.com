I'm still on the train and I'm almost in Carinthia. I've got to hurry now ðŸ™‚

Normally I would have been perfectly satisfied with the disapproving look of this cat, but then I read Mike Johnston's posts of <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2012/02/bw-through-the-years.html" target="_blank">yesterday</a> and <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2012/02/deconstruction.html" target="_blank">today</a>.  

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120217_072005_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120217_072005_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Of course I've sent him my own take at his image, and working on it I found it interesting to do a little B&W again. The image of the staircase was the obvious candidate among today's images, so here we go.

 On the other hand, if you are really interested in staircases, nobody does them better than <a href="http://www.sediama.de/" target="_blank">Karin Buerschaper</a>, aka <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/sediama/" target="_blank">Sediama</a> on Flickr. It's incredible what she does not only with staircases but with architecture in general. I enjoy every single image of hers.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/antony_and_the_johnsons/spiralling.html" target="_blank">Spiralling</a>" from Antony And The Johnsons 2005 album "I Am A Bird Now". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufmJo_OBWyM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

Oh yes, the Image of the Day has been taken with my new lens, the Panasonic Lumix G 14/2.5 ASPH. Got it today ðŸ˜„
