This is a bridge in Villach, seen from below. I have been there a few times, always with an ultra-wide angle,  but as I was determined to use the 40-150 today, I had to find a different perspective.

 Technically the image is bad. I had not checked, ISO was at 1600, needlessly so, but that all does not matter. The result is still pretty impressive and I would have no problem printing it big.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pink_floyd/welcome_to_the_machine.html" target="_blank">Welcome To The Machine</a>" from the 1975 Pink Floyd album  "Wish You Were Here". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB_2oIKUVks" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
