It rains here in Vienna and it will continue to do so tomorrow. It's not a pleasant kind of rain. It's not the kind of rain that you simply ignore, take your umbrella and shoot images regardless. There are strong gusts of wind that always threaten to tear your umbrella apart, and the wind makes the rain come at you almost horizontally from unpredictable directions.

 I made this image when I left work, still from a dry place. I made it in the last second, just before someone turned off the lights behind the widows on the right side. I made it before I left to buy my new Olympus 45/1.8 ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_zappa/outside_now.html" target="_blank">Outside Now</a>" from Frank Zappa's 1979 album "Joe's Garage". Hear it on YouTube.
