Here we are, the same escalator as yesterday, in an image freshly taken today. Normally I don't do that, but as this image is, if it were the only one, I would certainly have chosen it, even if I had had a bigger number to choose from. Compared to yesterday's image I probably like it better as well, thus there is no question, this is what you get today ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is somewhat used as well. I already had "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dido/one_step_too_far.html" target="_blank">One Step Too Far</a>" from the 2001 Faithless album "Outrospective" in a rather uninspired "<a href="/2007/11/397-one-step-too-far.html" target="_blank">397 â€“ One Step Too Far?</a>".

See Faithless featuring Dido in the official video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67maHVfZuDs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
