It was a sunny day and my Olympus 40-150's first day out ðŸ™‚

This is a slow lens. Winter mornings and evenings in Vienna are not her style. She craves bright light and that's what she got today.

This lens is cheap and I bought it cheaper. I've already mentioned it, it has a plastic mount, a first among my lenses, but optically it's top notch. In the morning I've made some mountain test shots from the terrace, at f9, and they are critically sharp even in the corners. Wide open it is sufficiently sharp as well. If you remember the cupola in "<a href="/2012/02/1946-its-been-so-long.html" target="_blank">1946 â€“ Itâ€™s Been So Long</a>", that image has been taken at f5.6 and it sharpened up nicely across the frame. I have certainly no complaints.

Often that is what long lenses do to me. 

The Image of the Day has been taken through a very dirty window of a car, at 150 mm (an equivalent of 300 mm on the PEN), at f6.3, at almost the minimum focusing distance, with the "circle" being the a reflection on another car.

 I've pushed contrast, and as it is, the image looks more like a weird kind of moon than anything else. 

I like abstract details like this, because they allow me to push the image wherever I want it. The subject is not recognizable anyway, thus all my inhibitions fall ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/y/yusuf_islam/this_glass_world.html" target="_blank">This Glass World</a>" from Yusuf Islam aka Cat Stevens' 2009 album "Roadsinger". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kf9C-tLd4A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
