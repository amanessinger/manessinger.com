Have you been on my blog today, say, two hours ago? You may have felt time-warped. No, not again! Really? Really.

My domain has been moved to another server and, lo and behold, instead of moving the current content, they have simply restored their last backup, dating from the time of the last troubles, pretty exactly a month ago. 

They didn't warn me beforehand, they didn't notify my after the fact, nothing. Obviously they believe I have my account just to pay them some money. Content? Who has content??

Oh well, this is Justhost.com, but only two weeks ago I had similar troubles with a domain and an email account at GoDaddy.com. It's just the same. It's not the company, it's the price you pay. But then, I'm not even sure if more money buys you so much more service, or if so, how much money I'd have to pay.

 It was no real problem this time. I had it fixed in about an hour. Again, it's just that someone without computer background would have no chance at all.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/the_price_you_pay.html" target="_blank">The Price You Pay</a>" from Bruce Springsteen's 1980 album "The River".
