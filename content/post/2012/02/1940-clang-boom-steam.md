Billows of steam? Here they are again, back with a vengeance ðŸ™‚

And so is Nikon. I guess you have heard of the D800, have you? Well, if you have not yet seen the samples, just have a look <a href="http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d800/sample01.htm" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d800/sample02.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. 36 megapixels and nothing but shocking! 

It's also shocking how well Nikon's lenses scale. Do you see any image that looks like the lens was not up to the task? I don't. Amazing, but then, when you look at the technical data, each of those images was made with one of Nikon's best lenses, all of them in $2000 territory. Still, I am surprised.

Do I desire this camera? Sure, who wouldn't? I guess I could even afford it (with a very bad feeling), but will I buy one? No. Absolutely not! Buying the necessary lenses would kill me ðŸ™‚

To the contrary. I will even sell one of my cameras. Which one? The Olympus E-P2, but before I sell it sometime in April, I'm gonna buy a few lenses. Two days ago for instance I have bought an Olympus ED 40-150mm 4.0-5.6 R MSC on eBay for 150â‚¬, shipping included. I may also buy one of the Panasonic pancakes, the Olympus 12/2.0 or the much lauded Olympus 45/1.8. 

Why, you ask? Of course to put them on the <a href="http://olympusomd.com/en-US/" target="_blank">Olympus OM-D</a> ðŸ˜„

Yeah, that's the other new camera, presented today, one day after the Nikon, and apart from the fact that it is much more in my league, monetarily speaking, it is exactly what I have always wanted: a smaller camera with interchangeable lenses, a tiltable LCD, an excellent built-in electronic viewfinder, a camera that shoots all aspect ratios, squares included, and that lets me compose in them, a camera with sensor stabilization, a camera that takes all lenses ever built, and as if that were not enough, it is beautiful as well.

 As I said, I'll sell the PEN and buy the OM-D. It's only slightly heavier, has more resolution, likely a tad better high ISO, is faster, and ergonomics could probably also be better. April, May probably. We'll see.

The Song of the Day is "Clang Boom Steam" from the 2004 Tom Waits album "Real Gone". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prW8d75BtMY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
