Today it was pretty clear that the sundown would be spectacular, I just couldn't decide where to go.

 My first impulse was Faaker See, a lake very near Villach, where I know a place that's ideal for picturing the setting sun. There is still ice on the lake though, and because I wanted reflections in water, I finally chose the bridge over the river Drau/Drava in Rosegg, an old favorite of mine.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/michael_buble/orange_colored_sky.html" target="_blank">Orange Colored Sky</a>" by Michael BublÃ©. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbMY2_o60cI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

Oh and, just because I stumbled upon it, here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=CeoYI9VOlIE" target="_blank">one song more</a>: a fantastic "Blue Moon" by an early Frank Sinatra. SCNR ðŸ˜„
