It was actually a bright, sunny, cold and beautiful day in Vienna. I didn't make many images though, this happens to be the best, thus what you get is an image from the Underground.


You see, I'm still using the LX5, at least for the rest of the week. It's just a pleasure, and when I have to choose between Olympus' and Panasonic's ergonomics, I take Panasonic all the time. 

The Song of the Day is "Blow Wind Blow" from Tom Waits' 1987 album "Franks Wild Years". See a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh_-AVsgzAs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
