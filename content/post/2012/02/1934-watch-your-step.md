It always pays to be curious. Today was an icy day, I left work late, and it was so cold that I decided to take the Underground home, even though I had no more than one image so far, that could probably have been usable. One out of two ðŸ™‚

When I saw the escalator, closed for maintenance, my first impulse was to just take the lift down, but then I decided to have a look.

 Well, having a look means taking an image, and in the end I was more than satisfied with the result. Hmm ... sometimes it's good to be not <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h01OlUVFo3k&feature=related" target="_blank">Gordon Freeman</a>. If I were, this probably would have been my only way down ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/santana/watch_your_step.html" target="_blank">Watch Your Step</a>" from the 1983 Santana album "Havana Moon". Many people don't like this album, but I already had it on Vinyl and always loved to dance to "Vereda Tropical". And besides, how can an album with Flaco Jimenez and Willie Nelson be bad? Impossible ðŸ™‚
