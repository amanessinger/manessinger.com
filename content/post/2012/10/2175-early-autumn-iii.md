It's already Wednesday, after a busy first half of the week I'm on the train to Carinthia and using the time to shorten my backlog. This is the post for Monday.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121001_165147_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121001_165147_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Monday was a beautiful day, sunny, although not as warm as I'd have liked it to be. But then, even I have to admit that it's autumn. You feel it, and most of all you feel it in the way the days have got shorter.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121001_173253_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121001_173253_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Those images were taken on a short walk after work, and the destination had to be chosen for being easy to reach. But even so, I had to hurry up to catch some images in late sunlight.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121001_180304_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121001_180304_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The way on the image to the left is through an area of allotments near a cutoff of river Danube. It could as well have been another installment of my <a href="/tag/electric-ladyland" target="_blank">Electric Ladyland</a> series. I really like the mix of architectures and somewhat improvised wiring ðŸ™‚

I also like the image of the last sunlight in the Underground station. It's a cool point of view, because although the image looks relatively wide, it has been taken using the 45/1.8, meaning an effective focal length of 90 mm.

 Oh and, by the way, at that walk I've somehow lost my front lens cap. Returning home I ordered a replacement from Amazon, and while I was at it, I also ordered the Olympus 12/2.0. Both should arrive on Friday. It was about time ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is the Johnny Mercer standard "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/early_autumn.html" target="_blank">Early Autumn</a>". We already had Ella Fitzgerald in "<a href="/2008/09/701-early-autumn.html" target="_blank">701 â€“ Early Autumn</a>" and Anita O'Day in "<a href="/2010/10/1449-early-autumn.html" target="_blank">1449 â€“ Early Autumn</a>". Surprisingly enough I have only those two versions, thus it's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNcRy7PLBSc" target="_blank">Ella again today</a>. Not sorry for that ðŸ™‚
