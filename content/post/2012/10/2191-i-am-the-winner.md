Weather was predicted to recover this afternoon and in a way it did. It stopped raining. Unfortunately that was all.

I left home at around 6 pm, but I soon realized that I lacked an important thing: a plan. After driving around aimlessly for a few minutes, I at least posted a letter and bought some tortelloni for dinner at the local Italian supermarket. I had already given up hope for an image when I saw this bus stop.

"Win up to 30.000â‚¬", that's what's promised by an ad for some lottery game. People seem to be crazy for them, but I am not. I sometimes play the lottery when there's a jackpot of more than 30 million Euros. I know the chances, but then, freak accidents happen and the thought of drawing tens of millions is somehow more attractive than the thought of getting "up to 30.000". I know, probabilities are different, but so are the qualities of dreams ðŸ˜„

 But I won anyway: after the recently sold Nikon 70-300 VR and the Sigma 10-20, I have sold my Tokina 11-16/2.8 today, and someone else considers buying the Nikon 18-200 VR and the Nikon 35/1.8. Let's see.

The Song of the Day is "I Am The Winner" from k.d.lang's 2011 album "K.D. Lang And The Siss Boom Bang: Sing It Loud". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDSb9GFi37o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
