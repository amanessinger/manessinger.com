Guess what I didn't do today. Need a hint? 

This image is more than a year old. It was at the end of a beautiful summer day in Vienna, I was waiting for the bus, carrying a red paper bag. Just a touch of color ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/sugababes/one_touch.html" target="_blank">One Touch</a>" from the 2000 Sugababes album of the same name. Hear it on YouTube.
