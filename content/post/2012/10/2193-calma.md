"Calma" means calm in Italian, and that's what the Image of the Day means to me: the calm of shortly after sundown.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121018_173841_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121018_173841_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Thursday was just as beautiful as predicted and I spent most of the day inside working, the blinds down to be able to read on my monitor. That's after I had taken off the three rainy days before. Very bad timing ðŸ™‚

Just before sundown I took the car and went out to still catch some light. The first image was taken 50 meters from home. We live a little bit off the main street into Villach, at the end of a small road partly lined by trees. I figured I had to take images very quickly or else the sun would be down behind mount Dobratsch, and so it was.

The Image of the Day finally was taken as a series of bracketed exposures, developed from RAW in Lightroom, exported as 16 bit TIFF images, merged to HDR and tone-mapped in Photoshop CS3. The algorithm used was "Highlight compression", an algorithm perfectly suited to sunset images.

 I could have used Photomatix Pro or some other HDR tool, I have a few, but when I strive for a natural and calm look, I always try Photoshop first.

The Song of the Day is "Calma" from Umberto Tozzi's 1980 album "Poste 80". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2rLXYmpTBY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
