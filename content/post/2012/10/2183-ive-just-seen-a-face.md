This image was inspired by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bengt_carlsson/8069544307/in/photostream" target="_blank">one of Bengt Carlsson's recent images</a>. It turned out very different, nevertheless Bengt's image was what I immediately thought of when I saw this torn advertising poster. 

Although this is the post for Tuesday, the image was actually taken on Monday. I did make some images on Tuesday, but none of them turned out particularly well. 

I am not very productive at the moment. It's the same thing as always, I've got a new lens and I have to adjust to the new way of seeing. The angle of a 12 mm lens (24 mm effectively) is not at all new to me, I have regularly used it on the LX5, but since the 45/1.8 has been by far my most used lens lately, I'll need a few days to adapt. Bear with me please ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is a wonderful version of "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/ive_just_seen_a_face.html" target="_blank">I've Just Seen A Face</a>", taken from Holly Cole's 1997 album "Dark Dear Heart". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuIzfSzkitY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
