It won't last indefinitely, but we can play this game for a while.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121013_184251_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121013_184251_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Today, on a day as bleak as yesterday, I was again shooting at nightfall, this time around the biggest church in Villach.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121013_185759_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121013_185759_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image to the left was taken with the Panasonic 20/1.7, all others with the new Olympus 12/2.0, handheld at 1/5 s, well stabilized by my iron grip, my solid stance and ... nope, just Olympus' incredibly well working in-body stabilization ðŸ™‚

I really liked the JPEGs from the camera, but in the end I have spent a lot of time tweaking the RAWs in Lightroom. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121013_185926_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121013_185926_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The biggest problem is always the over-the-top blue of the sky, but I've also tweaked local contrasts, yes even local color temperature. 

It's almost half a year now since I switched to Lightroom, and I don't miss Photoshop at all. It's only under the rarest circumstances that I switch back. There is simply no reason. Almost everything that I used to do in Photoshop or in its various plugins can be done in Lightroom as well, usually even easier.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121013_185839_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121013_185839_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Of course in a way I am restricting myself to straight photography, at least under Lightroom's generously stretched definition of "straight". Much of <a href="/2008/07/655-on-lonely-avenue.html" target="_blank">what I did</a> in <a href="/2008/07/629-electric-ladyland-v.html" target="_blank">the past</a> simply can't happen in that environment. We could say Lightroom covers a smaller creative space than Photoshop.

Do I worry about that? Should I?

 I really have no idea. The danger is, to find Lightroom comfortable enough to even accept an image that could (and should!) be driven much further in Photoshop.

Yes, I think I do worry about it and I'll keep it in mind.

The Song of the Day is "Everybody's Got A Game" from Solomon Burke's 1997 album "The Definition Of Soul". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d381ee16ezA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
