When I was for dinner at the superb Italian restaurant "<a href="http://www.sestante.at/" target="_blank">Il Sestante</a>", a waiter saw my camera and jokingly asked if I had come to take his portrait.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121023_164509_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121023_164509_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Sure, I answered, he posed and I took the image. 

Light was awful, actually a mix of extremely warm interior light and cold dusk light from outside, he was backlit, and although I managed to create a version with something like approaching even skin color, I am much more satisfied with the B&amp;W rendition shown here.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billy_joel/scenes_from_an_italian_restaurant.html" target="_blank">Scenes From An Italian Restaurant</a>" from Billy Joel's 1977 album "The Stranger". We've had it a couple of times, but hey, it's a good song from a stellar album ðŸ™‚
