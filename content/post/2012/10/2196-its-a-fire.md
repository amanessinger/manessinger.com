This is an odd collection of images. The motivation for the Image of the Day should be clear, but why the other two? Do they have something in common?

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121021_161158_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121021_161158_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It turns out yes, and that commonality was actually the reason to take the images at all.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20121021_160942_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20121021_160942_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> What they have in common is, that they both were taken with the Olympus 40-150, in both pictures carefully set to a focal length of 74 mm. That's one millimeter of from where I wanted it to be.

 I never had a lens with an effective focal length of 150 mm, and I was desperate to see how it looks like, what kind of crop it cuts out of my field of view. I wanted to see if I like it ... and I do ... which may bring a bag of problems, or better, a bag problem ðŸ™‚
