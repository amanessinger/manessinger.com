It's Wednesday night, I am on the train to Carinthia and this is the third (and last) image taken on Monday. Really. Promised ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/when_i_get_low_i_get_high.html" target="_blank">When I Get Low I Get High</a>" by Ella Fitzgerald and Chick Webb. Love that song, hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVhY8hKh4MY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

Btw, I also love the OM-D's rendition of highlights. Read what Ctein has to say about that in "<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2012/10/raw-is-not-raw.html" target="_blank">RAW is not Raw</a>".
