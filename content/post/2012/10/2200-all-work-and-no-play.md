I've bought a new system drive and because I can't find my copy of Windows 7 (dammit!) I have bought a Windows 7 as well. Now the computer here has a new system drive and most of the software installed. At least that's what I like to believe and what I know to be false ðŸ™‚

There are so many things to do when you set up a Windows computer, it really makes you sick. 

Compare that to the experience of buying a Google Nexus 7 Android tablet. They ask you for your Google account, and within a few minutes all the software that you've bought and installed on your phone is on the tablet as well. I suppose it won't be very different on the Apple side. It's only Windows that lets you do a thousand things over and again.

 Anyway. No data was lost, all is well. That's what counts ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/all_work_and_no_play.html" target="_blank">All Work And No Play</a>" from Van Morrison's 2002 album "Down The Road". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqcVynKau-Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
