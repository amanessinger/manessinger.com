The 75/1.8 is not an extraordinarily long lens, but it already shows some nice compression, and that's what gives this view down the stairs its slightly vertigo-inducing look.

And while we're at tumbling down, I arrived in Carinthia today and the desktop does not boot. Seems like the system drive has failed. Oh yeah, just what I needed for the weekend ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/steve_harley/tumbling_down.html" target="_blank">Tumbling Down</a>" by Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, originally from their 1973 album "Psychomodo". Great music, don't forget to hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAzx0t-bKHM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>!
