It's a wonderful time of the year, isn't it? It also pays off knowing your places.

 Every year this corner of a field, right on the road to our lake, is a safe bet for poppies. I didn't have anything else for today, so why not some flowers?

The Song of the Day is "Fields Of Flowers" from the 1984 album "Pure Fantasy" by Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia. Cool tune, hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe10cpnYdGo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
