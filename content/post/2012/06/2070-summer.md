Interesting. I made a lot of images today that I thought would be usable, and in the end I use an image that I never expected to be used.

 But then, somehow this image spoke to me of summer. It's not the luxurious lakeside residence, it's just an apartment house with small balconies. Still, the many colors of of the different sunshades give it a cheerful feeling.

The Song of the Day is "Summer" from Moby's "Play: B Sides" album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0qWza59Oyo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
