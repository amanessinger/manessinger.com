Yesterday afternoon I was swimming, and on my way to the lake I made these images.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120616_163818_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120616_163818_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> What I like in the image of my shadow is the natural vignette. It was taken in the middle of a narrow forest road, mostly shadowed by the trees.

It's a detour but it's such a picturesque place, it always pays to go there. This time I have used the Olympus 40-150. I like the Image of the Day much better than the other (there's a reason why I made it Image of the Day), but I've still included the second image for context.

 The Song of the Day is "Take Me Home Country Road" from Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's 1993 album "Facing Future". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EwtYVdfFoM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
