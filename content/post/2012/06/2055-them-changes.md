Oh yes, sometimes it's pretty hard to find a title that's also a song.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120602_172631_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120602_172631_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It goes like this: After yesterday's pink and red images, for a change today's post is green and yellow ðŸ˜„

I was swimming today. The river image is from somewhere in the middle between Villach and Keutschacher See, our lake.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120602_175006_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120602_175006_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The other image is from a spot that I rarely take photos of, because it belongs to a nudist camping ground. Only in late Spring and in early Autumn is it so empty on sunny days.

 The Image of the Day was made on our own place at the lake. I also tried to make some shallow DOF images through the flowers, but somehow nothing came out as I wanted. Maybe another day.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/buddy_miles/them_changes.html" target="_blank">Them Changes</a>" from the Eric Clapton / Steve Winwood album "Live From Madison Square Garden".
