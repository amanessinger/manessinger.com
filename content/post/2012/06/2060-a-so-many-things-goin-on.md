So many things goin' on and I can't decide about any kind of coherent post. Yesterday (this is the post for yesterday) I decided to just use the day's images for more than one day, but today I find I have some images as well.

The solution is to post more than one post for a single day. I've tried this once with the five posts starting with "<a href="/2012/05/2039-a-our-darkness.html" target="_blank">2039 A â€“ Our Darkness</a>" through "<a href="/2012/05/2039-e-till-the-end-of-the-day-ii.html" target="_blank">E â€“ Till The End Of The Day II</a>". Not that it was a very successful endeavor, hardly anybody noticed, but then, I don't do it for the money and I am on the train anyway ðŸ™‚

 This image was taken yesterday morning at the railway station. I used a public holiday for a day trip down to Carinthia.

The Song of the Day is the fabulous "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lynyrd_skynyrd/things_goin_on.html" target="_blank">Things Goin' On</a>" from the 1973 Lynyrd Skynyrd debut album "(Pronounced 'Leh-'NÃ©rd 'Skin-'NÃ©rd)". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xId25aroayo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
