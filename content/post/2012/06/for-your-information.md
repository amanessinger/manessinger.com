JustHost have informed me of a pending hardware upgrade. My account will be relocated to a backup server and then back to the new hardware. I have no idea what backup they'll use, I fully expect to see the state of January for a few days ðŸ™‚

To avoid surprises, I have just backed up my blog databases. I intend to lean back and relax. There will be no updates for <a href="http://xkcd.com/1070/" target="_blank">a couple of days</a>. If you read my blog via a feed reader, you'll be notified of updates anyway, if not, I suggest you come back at the weekend.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
