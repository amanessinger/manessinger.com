Wow, it's well past midnight on this Friday night, but the work is done, I managed to catch up ðŸ˜„

 This image was taken a few hours ago. I returned from swimming, earlier than yesterday, and I even managed to catch some last sunlight on this rural church.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/chris_de_burgh/in_a_country_churchyard_let_your_love_shine_on.html" target="_blank">In A Country Churchyard</a>" from Chris de Burgh's 1977 album "At the End of a Perfect Day". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oIfv82a6xo&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
