In a comment to "<a href="/2012/06/2057-a-thousand-times.html" target="_blank">2057 - A Thousand Times</a>" <a href="http://fotoblog.subhash.at/" target="_blank">Subhash</a> said that he<blockquote>... would have tried to make the composition more balanced. Maybe put the frame more to the right? The brass handle right is very dominant because that on the left it is much darker. Or... Maybe black &amp; white and adjusting the handles would be nice.</blockquote>Well, I pretty much like the original color version, but I see his point. 

Of course I had to try, and it was clear that I'd try B&amp;W. In the end I liked the result well enough to want to see it in a post of its own.

 Is this what <a href="http://fotoblog.subhash.at/" target="_blank">Subhash</a> meant? Possible, although not likely. It's in the nature of digital post-processing, that any number of different versions can be produced in order to satisfy any number of alternate visions. And of course this can be said of all my images. And of yours ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Visions" from Stevie Wonder's 1973 album "Innervisions". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJVErpWLDQo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
