This is a view through the window into a room that once was a Chinese restaurant near where I work.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120601_155032_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120601_155032_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Maybe it was not good enough, maybe the place is too much off the tracks for a restaurant, in any case it stood empty for at least two years, most likely more. I have no idea what they build there, but in any case it must have been hard to find a new tenant.

I saw that I stood pretty much exactly between two wagons, raised the camera, waited as long as I could, and the moment I had to release the shutter, a woman walked into the image, just at the right spot.

 The Song of the Day is Bruce Springsteen's "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/candys_room.html" target="_blank">Candy's Room</a>" from the 1978 album "Darkness On The Edge Of Town".
