Today instead of lunch I had to go to a bank in the center of Vienna. I took the short route through Hofburg, the imperia palace, and that's where I saw the bicycles and the carriage passing through.

The Song of the Day is the incredibly beautiful "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aretha_franklin/all_the_kings_horses.html" target="_blank">All The King's Horses</a>" from Aretha Franklin's 1971 masterwork "Young, Gifted and Black". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVZdJQaWMzA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
