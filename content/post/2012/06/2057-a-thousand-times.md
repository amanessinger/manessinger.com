Inspiration for photography is a strange thing. I must have seen this door a thousand times, but never did it click. This morning I went to work with the 45/1.8 mounted, and the way that I used a portrait lens to make images straight on architectural details may at least have been unusual for me. DOF is on the verge of being too thin, but only on the verge.

 Hmm ... do you also feel that this door detail could also be of some old music instrument?
