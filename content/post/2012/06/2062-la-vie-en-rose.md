Some days are better, some days are not. Today was not. And still, regardless of how I feel, there are always images that sneak to my attention. 

Like the B&amp;W image below. It rained, I stood under a glass roof and looked up at some modern architecture. It took me some experimenting in Lightroom to find a tonal balance that would emphasize mainly the water drops. I think I found it ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120609_130010_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120609_130010_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Or the Image of the Day. In reality the first thing that caught my attention was the tree in the background with its beautiful leaves, in shape as well as in color. And then I saw the rose. 

 I really wanted to frame the rose in front of the leaves, but that was completely impossible. It was even impossible to center the rose or to bring it to one of the thirds. This was really the only solution, and although I didn't have much choice, I think I like it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "La Vie En Rose" from Cyndi Lauper's 2003 album "At Last". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqbuNzyyq6A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
