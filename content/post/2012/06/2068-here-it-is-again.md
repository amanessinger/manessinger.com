Almost a week I had to do without summer, but here it is again now.

 I stopped working late and it was already half past eight when I made this image. Oh my, do I love these long days!

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/here_it_is_again.html" target="_blank">Here It Is Again</a>" from the 1992 album "0898 Beautiful South". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5ys0S1g2N4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
