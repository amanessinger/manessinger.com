It's Sunday evening, I am on the train back to Vienna and this is an image that I took late afternoon when I was swimming. Basically just the same as yesterday, and that's not really bad ðŸ™‚

Now I'll add keywords to last October's images, maybe for an hour or two, and then I'll have a nap until I arrive in Vienna.

 Btw: I have bought Lightroom now. For a long time I have been a skeptic, but now I am all fire ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Feelin' The Same Way" from Norah Jones' 2002 album "Come Away With Me", Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPCeJcvzYis" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
