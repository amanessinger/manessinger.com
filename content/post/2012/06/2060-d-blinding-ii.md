This is a church in Villach, the church of Perau, probably the most beautiful of Villach's churches.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120607_172643.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120607_172643.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> I had intended it as a silhouette, with the sun just peeking out from behind, but when I saw it, I thought, heck, let's try to see how much I can get out of the dark areas with Lightroom.

Of course I had to use pretty strong noise reduction, but I think the result, although not a great image, is a testament to the abilities of the OM-D and of Lightroom as well. I couldn't have got that result from the Nikon D300 and I couldn't have got it without Lightroom either. Feel free to pixel-peep, the original size is on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/7349726416/sizes/o/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. 

 And it's not only the fact that I could get anything out of the shadow at all. The color of the church is pretty accurate and the sky is still a sky. Had I tried to make such an image, I would have bracketed exposures and used HDR software. Pretty amazing, if you ask me üòÑ
