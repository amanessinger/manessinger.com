Yesterday I was a tad late for swimming, but really, swimming after sundown, almost at night, has its own charms. When I took this image, handheld at 1/4s, I saw tiny flickering lights around me: fireflies! Pretty magic, if you ask me.

 It was so dark under the trees, I didn't even try to take an image. Probably I should have. Probably I'll try tomorrow. Probably the opportunity is gone. Who knows.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/doris_day/its_magic.html" target="_blank">It's Magic</a>" by Dinah Washington. Like so many of her songs it's marred by an over-abundance of strings, but then you hear her magic voice and then nothing else matters ðŸ™‚

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6KFxKBjxws" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
