Here are two images made yesterday. Two times construction work, two different places.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120605_082923_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120605_082923_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The Song of the Day is the Harold Arlen standard "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/harold_arlen/lets_take_a_walk_around_the_block.html" target="_blank">Let's Take a Walk Around the Block</a>", performed by the great Ella Fitzgerald.

 I have it on her "Harold Arlen Songbook", which itself is part of the fabulous "Complete Ella Fitzgerald Song Books" box. I bought it many years ago, definitely cheaper than what Amazon asks for today, but although it was expensive even then, I definitely call it one of my best buys ðŸ™‚

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWf_hLTHUlY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
