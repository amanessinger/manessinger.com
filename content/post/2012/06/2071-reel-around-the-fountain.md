This is a typical image where I need to go into Photoshop. I shot square and I had two versions, one cut at the top, one cut at the bottom.

 Developed in Lightroom, combined in Photoshop, vignette applied in Lightroom again.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/reel_around_the_fountain.html" target="_blank">Reel Around The Fountain</a>" from the 1984 Smiths album "Hatful of Hollow". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuWZEhbe8x8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
