This is not a great image and it's not meant to be. Quality-wise it is about as good as I would have got from the Nikon D200, using for instance the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC wide open at ISO 1600. Only this is the OM-D, f8 at 1/10 s and ISO 12800.

 I wouldn't have needed to go that high, I just wanted to see what I get at such a high sensitivity (or rather amplification). Only Lightroom was used. Taking it into Photoshop and blending layers with different strengths of noise reduction applied, I could probably have gotten an even better result. No need though, in practice I would rarely go that high. It's nice to know that I can though.
