Here's the picture for Friday, one more from the tiny Czech town of Telc, right across the border from Austria. It's all Lightroom again. Well, now that some time has passed since I processed it, colors look a tad too cool to me, but forgive me, I'm learning.

 The lens is the cheap Olympus 40-150 again. Incredible how useful it can be on such a trip ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/tiny_town.html" target="_blank">Tiny Town</a>" from David Byrne's 1992 album "Uh-Oh". Wonderful album, good song, hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePmnGqpg9tM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
