A busy street cuts through where once the cemetery of the baroque church of Perau was. Today Perau is a part of Villach, almost at the center, and one of the bridges over river Drau crosses there, crosses and leads into the street that cuts the old churchyard in two.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120527_192445_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120527_192445_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> What remains is still beautiful. There are some tombs built into the south wall, but of course none of the plain graves have survived.

 Yesterday I drove by and there was wonderfully mild sunlight, but when I finally had parked my car, it was all gone. As I was already there, I still took some pictures.

The Song of the Day is "Then The Letting Go" from Bonnie "Prince" Billy's 2006 album "The Letting Go". Someone on YouTube has made a nice <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdarsEsB090" target="_blank">animation video</a>, don't miss it.
