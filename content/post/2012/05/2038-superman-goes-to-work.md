OK, I admit, at first, when I took the image, I didn't see him. In fact I didn't even see him while processing the image, but when I finally did, I had to smile.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seeklyrics.com%2Fprinter.php%3Flyric_id%3D1666081&langpair=de%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Supermann</a>" from Marius MÃ¼ller-Westernhagen's 1998 album "Radio Maria". For the majority of you who don't understand German, I have linked the song title to an automatic translation of the <a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/marius-m-ller-westernhagen-supermann-lyrics.html" target="_blank">original lyrics</a>.

The original video is kind of a "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" story. See it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbzqDTwdPEs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
