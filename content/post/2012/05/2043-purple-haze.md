Sometimes it's hard to decide what the Image of the Day shall be. None of these three images is breathtaking, all are more or less OK.

I intended to take images of the books, when suddenly a man passed by. I had only half of his body in the frame and somehow I liked the idea. Some seconds later I had this image.

With the OM-D's articulating screen it is very convenient to take these images from waist level.

 And of course finally there is the creamy bokeh of the background flowers. The flowers won, greatly helped by the title ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Purple Haze" from the 1986 Kronos Quartet album "Music by Sculthorpe, Sallinen, Glass, Nancarrow, Hendrix". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQKaBKDQ3b0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
