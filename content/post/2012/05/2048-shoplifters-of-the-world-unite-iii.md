Today I was totally uninspired. I rose late, couldn't make myself get out, and when I finally did, I had no idea where to go, what to take photos of. I knew I had to go to the supermarket, so eventually I did. I had the full intention to give up and to use one of the images from my archives, but then, when I went to fetch a cart, I saw the pattern of that mass of carts, neatly stacked, lined up, but still forming a curve.

I tried three different lenses, the 45/1.8, the 14/2.5, and in the end I settled with the 40-150.

While we are at shopping, you may know that I've recently finished Asimov's "Foundation" series, including the so-called "Second Foundation" trilogy. Much could be said about that, but that's for another day.

I have still one Asimov left, "The End Of Eternity", not directly part of "Foundation", but closely related, and I want to save it for later. For now I crave for something completely different, the "Dying Earth" series by Jack Vance.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/misc/stupid.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/misc/stupid.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In my youth I have owned (but strangely never read) three books by Jack Vance in German translation: "The Gray Prince" and the first two of the three "Alastor" novels.

You know, I have given up on plastic and paper. When earlier I used to buy CDs and physical books, I now buy MP3s and eBooks. Thus I wanted to buy the four "Dying Earth" books as eBooks. What else?

 Here I encountered a tiny little problem. Book one, "The Dying Earth", is sold on <a href="http://www.jackvance.com/" target="_blank">Jack Vance's own web site</a> under his preferred title "Mazirian the Magician". Unfortunately it's the only one. For the missing books Vance directs us to Amazon and to the eBook series "<a href="http://www.sfgateway.com/" target="_blank">Gateway</a>".

Indeed they have many books by Jack Vance, but of the Dying Earth series they have only three. Creatively they omit book #3 of the tetralogy. Is that cool? How can that be? What do they think? Do they think? Oh my!

Well, that's it. The 50 books "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Masterworks" target="_blank">Fantasy Masterworks</a>" series has as book #4 the omnibus edition "Tales of the Dying Earth", but unfortunately it is paper only. I really was pissed.

Can you remember the <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones" target="_blank">Oatmeal comic</a> about the "Game of Thrones" TV series? Well, what could I do? I bought books #1, #2 and #4, and then I searched for an eBook of "Tales of the Dying Earth". Surprisingly, although I did not find it for sale, I found it for free on a file hosting site, ALONG WITH ALL OTHER 49 BOOKS OF THE "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Masterworks" target="_blank">Fantasy Masterworks</a>" SERIES!!!! Talk about shooting yourself in the foot ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„

 Stupid, huh? And it's not a scan of dubious quality. As far as I can tell, it must be a regular eBook, probably sold in some market other than mine. Really, I'm so sick of it, this industry is even more stupid than the rest of the content industry. It's a disgrace! C'mon guys, I'm totally willing and able to buy, you just have to offer the goods. If you don't and if I resort to what you try to make the world call piracy, just shut up and don't complain. You've had your chance. Nobody forced you to apply for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Awards" target="_blank">Darwin Award</a>.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/shoplifters_of_the_world_unite.html" target="_blank">Shoplifters Of The World Unite</a>", this time from Morrissey's 2008 album "Live At Earls Court". See him perform <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBkk27t_OxA&feature=related" target="_blank">live in Manchester</a>.
