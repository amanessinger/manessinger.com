When I saw this bike, it was clear that I had to take an image. The problem only was, that it was impossible to properly isolate it.

In such a case, when I can't get rid of the surroundings, I try to use them creatively. Half a face, a strong, oblique line, I think it balances quite well.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120510_180359_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120510_180359_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The other image reminded me both of a cross and of a ship's mast. 

 Both images, like all images during the last 10 days, were made with Lightroom. I still haven't finished viewing the video tutorials, but I already feel confident. The program is pretty amazing, in 10 days I had only once the need for a short detour to Photoshop.

The Song of the Day is "Meditação", taken from the 1999 selft-titled Quarteto Jobim-Morelenbaum album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIWnleo1YC0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
