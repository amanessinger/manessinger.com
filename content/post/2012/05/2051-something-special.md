What the hell is special here, you ask? Simple, I say. The music ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120529_185429_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120529_185429_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Well, I have searched for a title and I could and could not find anything that would match the Image of the Day. On the other hand, I stumbled by chance upon "Something Special", a great song from De Phazz's 2001 album "Death by Chocolate". Sorry, I couldn't resist. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oldITeTripc&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and you know why ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120529_185643_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120529_185643_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image of the window was taken in the morning on my way to work, the other two on an evening walk. 

 The roses were especially challenging. This is one of those images that look terribly oversaturated as JPEG, but working from RAW, there is no problem at all. It's all there, no channel is burned out. I had to tone the reds way, way down and also desaturate them, in order to get full detail back, but at least it was possible.
