Another day, more meadows sprinkled with gold dust. Today it was not as clear and bright as yesterday, but Michael and I went swimming around noon and then it was sunny enough.

 The water was colder than last week though. No wonder after the rain and the cold weather.

Like yesterday the Song of the Day is "Gold Dust" from Tori Amos' 2002 album "Scarlet's Walk". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMzVSk45zBs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
