Here's one last image taken late Thursday afternoon. I hope you agree that it's worth its own post ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kinks/till_the_end_of_the_day.html" target="_blank">Till The End Of The Day</a>" by The Kinks. I have no idea from which original album it is. It probably does not matter, at least as download you'll only be able to get it as part of various collections. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utiosGC7RKc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
