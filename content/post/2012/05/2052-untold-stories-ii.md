By chance I found three Lightroom "<a href="http://lightroomkillertips.com/2012/lightroom-4-presets-hdr-effect-part-2/" target="_blank">HDR presets</a>" on Matt Kloskowski's site. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2011/20111119_153620_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2011/20111119_153620_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I just had to try them, and looking for an image I found these two, taken in mid-November. Actually I didn't like the strong vignetting of the original presets at all, but they were a start, and with some experimenting I arrived at what you see.

 The result looks pretty natural to me, pleasing and without the oversaturated look that you see so often. I can remember having tried to work on one of those images the day I took them, but then I came to no conclusion and instead <a href="/2011/11/1859-electric-ladyland-xiii.html" target="_blank">took another image</a>.

"Untold Stories" is from Sinead O'Connor's 2005 album "Throw Down Your Arms". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FJYXad_J7k" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
