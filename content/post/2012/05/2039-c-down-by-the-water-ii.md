Here's the next part of my Thursday images.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120517_190226_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120517_190226_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This time it's about a walk down to the water. This blossom is a good example for the tremendous amount of highlight recovery that you get from the OM-D.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120517_192823_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120517_192823_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image with the strong light reflexes in the water was pretty hard to process. It took me two days and four attempts until I had it where it is now, and still I am not satisfied. Anyway, that's as far as I go, maybe I should have dropped it altogether ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2012/20120517_185450_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2012/20120517_185450_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I didn't really expect anything from that walk. I just wanted to go out and snap some pictures. But that's how it is, some days are richer than others.

 The (third) Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pj_harvey/down_by_the_water.html" target="_blank">Down By The Water</a>" from P. J. Harvey's 1995 album "To Bring You My Love". I already had it in "<a href="/2010/11/1491-down-by-the-water.html" target="_blank">1491 â€“ Down By The Water</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbq4G1TjKYg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
