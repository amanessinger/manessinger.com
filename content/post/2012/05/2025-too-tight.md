The Olympus 40-150 lens is extremely cheap, has a plastic mount, even looks cheap, but it is really a quite capable lens. With an aperture range of 3.5-5.6 it can certainly be called a fair-weather lens, but on a bright, sunny day aperture is not a problem anyway, at least as long as you shoot architecture or landscape, applications where you normally welcome depth of field.

 This is another Lightroom-only image. I have no idea yet how to cope with multiple computers, multiple catalogs and the synchronization issues. It will be crucial to find out about that, or else I'm going to lose adjustments.
