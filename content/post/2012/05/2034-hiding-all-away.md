The forecast for today only told of rain and cold. It was all different though.

 Michael is here and we went swimming in the early afternoon. The lake is already warm enough, though there are almost no tourists yet. I took the image from a bridge (the word bigger than the thing) over a small creek, just around the corner from the lake.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nick_cave_and_the_bad_seeds/hiding_all_away.html" target="_blank">Hiding All Away</a>" from the 2004 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds album "Abattoir Blues / Lyre Of Orpheus". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkxgFoWwW5w" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
