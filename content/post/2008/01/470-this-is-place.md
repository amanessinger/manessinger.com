I've returned, because yesterday's image was cut too tight on the right side.<br/><br/>You see, I'm still shooting unorthodox landscapes. Hmm ... can it be that shooting landscapes with telephoto lenses is out of fashion? Or is it only I who can't see those images in a sea of wide-angle shots? Whatever it is, for me this is an exciting place to explore. I did it with the Sigma 70/2.8 for more than a month now, and at the moment it is the Sigma 150/2.8 that I use. It gives me even more compression, and  wide open the DOF is so shallow, it's pure bliss.<br/><br/>I have long wondered what this image means to me. The trees are a bit like a barrier, a fence, a circle unbroken, guards protecting a forbidden place. This is an inside viewed from an outside, and maybe this place was sacred for some long forgotten people? What does it mean to you?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080126_153953_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080126_153953_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> There is only one more image for today- It's from the same place where I've been in the afternoon, two days ago. Power lines and telephone cables can be the bane of the landscape photographer, but who says that they can't be an interesting subject?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/talking+heads/this+must+be+the+place_10228728.html" target="_blank">This Must Be The Place</a>" from the 1983 Talking Heads album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speaking-Tongues-Talking-Heads/dp/B000002KZ6" target="_blank">Speaking in Tongues</a>". See it performed live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkZHjn3A-yk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I guess it's from the concert movie "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Making-Sense-Bernie-Worrell/dp/B000021Y7X" target="_blank">Stop Making Sense</a>". Funny that I've never seen the movie, funny that its soundtrack is the only Heads CD that I don't have. I guess I'm atypical in this respect ðŸ™‚
