Has the world become a better place? No, of course not. Have we learned our share? As individuals maybe, as the human race, no. At least I can see no progress towards humanity, peace and understanding. Let's hope for next year, like every other year.<br/><br/>Today I spent most of my time surfing the internet, socializing at the Radiant Vista forums again after a long time, answering some comments, and then, when the light would have been best, I was tired and laid myself to bed for an afternoon nap.<br/><br/>I woke up when the sun was just down, grabbed my gear and drove to Klagenfurt, in the hope of getting some image there. What I got, these stairs, was shot with the Sigma 30/1.4 at f10 and 30s, obviously from the tripod.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071231_235952_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071231_235952_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> At midnight finally, like any other year, I tried my best to capture some fireworks, this time with the Sigma 10-20. The result is not so abysmal as last year, but it is far from where I would want it to be. But, wait, give me some dozen years more practice, and I promise you, you'll get a masterpiece. Hmm ... or at least something decent ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne" target="_blank">Auld Lang Syne</a>", interpreted by the great Eddi Reader on her 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reader-Sings-Songs-Robert-Burns/dp/B00013T7VE" target="_blank">Eddi Reader Sings the Songs of Robert Burns</a>".
