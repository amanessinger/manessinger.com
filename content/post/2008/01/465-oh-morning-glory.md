I may take more images, there may be some good, but - honestly - I don't believe I can top this.<br/><br/>Of course it's a clichÃ© (hi <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2008/01/fabulous-fotos-not.html" target="_blank">Ted</a>!), what more than a sunrise or sundown, and even though I did some major post-processing, I can't really claim the grandezza. I was simply at the right time in the right place, i.e. at home ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This was probably the most impressive morning red that I have seen in a long time. I could have run for the Sigma 10-20 and even at 10mm I wouldn't have been able to frame the whole spectacle. On the other hand, I'm glad I didn't, kept the Nikon 18-200 VR and at least scored the image as it is, because only one or two minutes later all was over, and then the fog began to rise, reached us, and at 2pm it is still here.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080121_165907_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080121_165907_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> EDIT: I simply had to add this sundown. Seems it's sunrise/sundown time. Hmm ... last year at that time it was waterfalls ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/morningglory.html" target="_blank">Morning Glory</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dear-Heather-Leonard-Cohen/dp/B0002MPTDO" target="_blank">Dear Heather</a>". Hear the full song at <a href="http://mp3skyline.com/rid-0xcaa5-leonard-cohen_-_morning-glory_-_album-mp3-download.htm" target="_blank">mp3skyline.com</a>. They have an interesting concept for sound samples: They let you hear the full song, but interrupt it with a beep every 30 seconds or so. That's great, because this song develops its own grandezza, and not before the end ðŸ™‚
