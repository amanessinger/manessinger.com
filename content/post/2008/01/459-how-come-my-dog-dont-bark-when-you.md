Small wonder, I processed them in the same session on the train. Again the image was shot with the Lensbaby, and this time I have used two images from a series of eight. In the morning I saw this dog waiting in front of a bakery. He was so cute and at the same time seemed so helpless, I simply had to take some images. Finally none of them was particularly good, thus I combined two of them with different areas of relative sharpness, and then I did the edge finding game again, once more with two layers, one of them for rough contours, one for texture.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "How Come My Dog Don't Bark When You Come Around" from Dr. John's 1992 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goin-Back-New-Orleans-John/dp/B000002LTW" target="_blank">Goin' Back to New Orleans</a>". Hear it sung live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4OVqVXvg_Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Nice performance.<br/><br/>The Good Thing: I go to sleep now. The Bad Thing: I have to get up in less than three hours. Oh my!
