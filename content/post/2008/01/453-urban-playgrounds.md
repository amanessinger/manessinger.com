At the age of four I roamed the forest behind our house, together with my cousin. I didn't know such things as playgrounds. Everything was a vast playground, and danger was unknown to us. Yes, there was a street, but we didn't need to cross it. The forest was on our side, and everything else that was interesting was as well. There were two forests, two ponds and a small creek, animals, fields, it was paradise.<br/><br/>Urban playgrounds depress me, but my paradise is gone as well. The street is now very busy, almost a highway, our old house is behind a noise barrier, most of the forest is gone and the fields gave way to houses. Change can be harsh.<br/><br/>Where I live now, far outside of Klagenfurt, there is paradise again.
