After 18 hours of framing, driving from home to Villach, back home and with the images again to Villach, after all the hassle of trying to make sense of different images, matte colors, room colors and sizes, I was so tired that, finally at home, I didn't even manage to write this. Ted, I know how you felt ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This is the room that has the most images, some on the wall you see, some along the windows. The furniture will be removed until the evening. The other rooms are smaller and on one wall we will project a slideshow of other images that are not part of the show. The show begins at 7:30pm and I have no idea when I'll come home. I'll try to provide better images from the actual event ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/kate-bush-fullhouse-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Fullhouse</a>" from Kate Bush's 1978 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lionheart-Kate-Bush/dp/B000BDJ610" target="_blank">Lionheart</a>".
