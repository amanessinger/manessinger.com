In short words: it was a success in that people liked what they saw, it was less of a success in that I did not sell. One of the reasons was, that we had extremely bad weather and those who came were mostly friends and family. On the other hand I met some very good friends and we had a nice and relaxed evening. All in all it was a fantastic evening and great fun.<br/><br/>I shall post some images of tonight later, here or on the Radiant Vista, but for now one image must suffice. We were already to pack and go home when shortly before midnight I saw these glasses, took three images and immediately was in love.<br/><br/>Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8, 1/80s and ISO 500. This is the unedited image right out of the camera.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Glass Houses" from Hazel O'Connor's 1980 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sons-Lovers-Hazel-OConnor/dp/B000026VHA" target="_blank">Sons &amp; Lovers</a>".
