I paused to take an image of this door across the street, when I noticed that it would be much better to wait for passers-by. I did, captured a group of people coming from left, and then this young woman from right, pressing forcefully against the resistance of the graffiti.<br/><br/>Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, 1/25s and ISO 3200.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/pressing.html" target="_blank">Pressing On</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1980 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saved-Bob-Dylan/dp/B0000025IS" target="_blank">Saved</a>". Nice on the album, but the real gem is the live version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzrl13XMD6U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Go for it!
