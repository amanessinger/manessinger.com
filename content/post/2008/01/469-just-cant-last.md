For me it's always a struggle with landscapes. In Vienna I can go out at any time of the day and pull a rabbit out of a hat, even if the rabbit did not exist before and the hat is not even there, but here I am much more bound by the cycle of light. Yesterday I was extremely late, in fact I had only about 20 precious minutes before the light was gone. This first image was taken only some meters up the way from where I took "<a href="/2008/01/468-wild-wood.html" target="_blank">468 - Wild Wood</a>". This time I had the urge to take my current landscape strategy to extremes. I used the Sigma 150/2.8 wide open, relishing the enormously short DOF. I'll return to this very place today, to repeat an image that I've tried yesterday but have cut too tight to be usable.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080125_160513_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080125_160513_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The next one was taken some minutes later along the street towards Klagenfurt. We had this lookout <a href="/2007/12/439-lookout.html" target="_blank">before</a>, this time it was during the last seconds of fading sunshine.<br/><br/>Driving that direction was useless now, so I turned around, because back in the upper parts of Ludmannsdorf I could still see some sun. That's where the Image of the Day was taken. I made two versions, one at f8 and this one at f2.8, focused on the edge of the lawn where the sun still hit. From a purely artistic point of view the mole hills are slightly distracting, but on the other hand they give depth and I wouldn't have been able to clone them all out anyway.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/natalie-merchant-just-can-t-last-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Just Can't Last</a>" from Natalie Merchant's 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Motherland-Natalie-Merchant/dp/B00005R1Q5" target="_blank">Motherland</a>".  On <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZJWfLRJf_E" target="_blank">YouTube</a> you can see a clip with the full song performed live on the "Late Night Show".
