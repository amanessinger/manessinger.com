The problem is, that something new and amazing is brewing up, and I am a tad short of time at the moment ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080128_173358_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080128_173358_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> There are two images for today (well, Monday that actually was. Grumble!), and let's begin with this one. It may have a story, but I'm not sure which one. A woman opening a door, a sign directing pedestrians away from her, and then this overly bright and bluish light??? Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, 1/100s and ISO 3200. Some Photoshop treatment ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Had I known more about the story behind #1 (which actually was #2 chronologically), I would have made it Image of the Day, and then maybe not. The bicycles were just too sweet. You know I love <a href="/search/label/Bicycle" target="_blank">bicycles</a> as a subject, and these two perfect circles leaning on straight lines, the composition with the lights of CafÃ© Raimund in the background, the slants, this is so geometrically rich that I impossibly could have dismissed it. Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, 1/100s and ISO 1000. Noise was higher than to be expected from that ISO, because I have severely pushed the foreground and completely re-lit the scene after the fact. I could have used flashes while being there, but then I probably would not have taken the image at all ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "In Circles" from the 2000 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silence-Sexy-EinstÃ¼rzende-Neubauten/dp/B00004TM12" target="_blank">Silence is Sexy</a>" by EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten.
