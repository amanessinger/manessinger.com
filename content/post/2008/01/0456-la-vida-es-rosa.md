When I drove into town it was just the right mixture for disaster, and though I could avoid any trouble, two people have died on the streets that morning.<br/><br/>I had to buy paper for passepartouts, a metal ruler, a sharp knife, all for the show next week. Did I mention that I have an exhibition in a caf√© in Villach, starting next Thursday? Well, I have printed 24 images last Tuesday, and now I only need to frame them. A lot of work, but what did I do? I slept the whole afternoon, and when I woke up I had to create an image.<br/><br/>This is the Lensbaby again, but this time with a macro lens attached. Post-processing was done in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "La vida es rosa", Ana Salazar's 2005 Flamenco rendition of Edith Piaf's unforgettable "La vie en rose". It's from the album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Un-Himno-Amor-Ana-Salazar/dp/B0002ZEWJ8" target="_blank">Un Himno Al Amor</a>". Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Un-Himno-Amor-Ana-Salazar/dp/B0000CGEC7" target="_blank">German</a> division has a sound sample.
