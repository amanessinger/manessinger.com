I shot this particular image down in the valley at the storage lake, just some seconds before the sun vanished behind the trees.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.glasspages.org/liquidlyrics.html" target="_blank">Freezing</a>". Lyrics by Suzanne Vega, music by Philip Glass, the beautiful voice by Linda Ronstadt. It's from the 1990 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philip-Glass-Songs-Liquid-Days/dp/B000002616" target="_blank">Songs from Liquid Days</a>". We already had the title song in "<a href="/2007/05/209-liquid-days.html">209 - Liquid Days</a>". Hear "Freezing" on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YcFcunLF8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
