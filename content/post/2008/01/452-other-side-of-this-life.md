I'm back to the Sigma 70/2.8. This image was shot at f8, 1/100s and ISO 220. In Camera RAW I have pushed vibrancy quite a bit and clarity a bit more. Normally I don't use the clarity slider too much, but for textures like this it is fine.<br/><br/>What more can I say about an abstract image like this? That it reminds me of a map? Or a very abstract person speaking a very abstract bubble? And is this really important?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.davidbyrne.com/music/cds/grown_backwards/grown_back_lyrics.php" target="_blank">The Other Side of This Life</a>" from David Byrne's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grown-Backwards-David-Byrne/dp/B0001D3KNK" target="_blank">Grown Backwards</a>".
