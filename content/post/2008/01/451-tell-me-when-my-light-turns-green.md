I've taken a day off from work for printing, and that's what I've done all day. This is the image for yesterday, one for today will follow in a few hours.<br/><br/>This should have been a B&amp;W image. Yesterday when I went home from work, I did what I've said I'd do: I set the camera to "monochrome", ISO 6400 maximum and Auto-ISO, and then I walked off into the night.<br/><br/>What can I say? It did not turn out all too well. I was a bit in a hurry, and I believe that after so much color work, I would have needed time to let myself fall into that B&amp;W vision, time to experiment. I mean, I can do B&amp;W work, you have seen some, and if not then you can search for the label <a href="/search/label/Black%20and%20White" target="_blank">           Black and White</a> and see for yourself, but going out with the express intent of shooting only B&amp;W and willingly ignoring color, that's a different story. Whatever, maybe it's not my thing, maybe I was not in the mood (actually I found it depressing), the outcome is that I have no real inclination to try it again anytime soon ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Thankfully not all was lost, because setting the camera to "monochrome" changes nothing of what the RAW file contains, and this is of course color information. This was not a really bad B&amp;W image, but, lo and behold, in color and with a tiny color shift towards green, it looks real good to my eyes.<br/><br/>Sigma 30/1.4 at f1.4, 1/50s and ISO 720.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.justsomelyrics.com/1053787/Dexy's-Midnight-Runners-Tell-Me-When-My-Light-Turns-Green-Lyrics" target="_blank">Tell Me When My Light Turns Green</a>" from the 1980 debut album of one of the best bands of the eighties, no, one of the best bands ever: I'm speaking of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Searching-Young-Rebels-Midnight-Runners/dp/B00004WGY9" target="_blank">Searching for the Young Soul Rebels</a>" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.
