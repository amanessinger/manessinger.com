I do. I invented it. Actually when I was there I saw the potential, but in reality I've made these colors up. Hey, no street looks like this!<br/><br/>Or do some? It's interesting how easily we accept colors, and even so outlandish ones as in this image. Out of the camera this was all yellow. Shades of different yellows. <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/misc/tutorial.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/misc/tutorial.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> What I did in Camera RAW, was to put a gray point in one of the mid-yellows, with the intention to make the background blue. Not too blue, but blue. The yellow became a tad too greenish, thus I created a vignette with a red filter and a curves layer for darkening. The result was considerable color depth, paired with the depth created by the vignette. From there on I did some painting with light to accentuate the path, overlayed a B&amp;W layer in mode "Soft Light" to push contrasts, and finally I strongly lightened the woman walking the dog, giving her back the original yellowish color to completely separate her from the background. What else? Oh, some minor cosmetics, a blur, Noise Ninja, only the usual stuff. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080110_165535_cam.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080110_165535_cam.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Normally I don't do this, but here to the left is the image that the camera saw. It is intentionally overexposed, but not very far from what boring reality looked like.<br/><br/> I like this image, because I've made it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, 1/30s and ISO 3200.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.songfacts.com/lyrics.php?findsong=4809" target="_blank">Walking The Dog</a>" from the 1964 Rolling Stones album "The Rolling Stones (England's Newest Hitmakers)".
