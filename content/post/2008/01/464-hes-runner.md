We are at an altitude of 600 meters, and it would take a hundred more to get out of the fog. Today when I brought Michael to the train, we were a bit late for Klagenfurt and early for Velden, thus I took the alternative route via Schiefling, because I hoped we would get out of the fog. It was not entirely successful. This image was taken at the highest point, and we were still not really out, but at least the flaming clouds were already visible. I decided to take an image, just as a runner came by.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 VR at 18mm, f8, 1/8s and ISO 1100, hand-held.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/blood-sweat-tears-he-s-a-runner-lyrics.html" target="_blank">He's A Runner</a>" from the third Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Tears-3/dp/B0000024W8" target="_blank">3</a>".
