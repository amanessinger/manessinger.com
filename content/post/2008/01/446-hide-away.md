Welcome to the wonderful world of non-stabilized telephoto lenses.<br/><br/>Anyway, I like this image so much (or all the others of yesterday so much less) that it had to be the Image of the Day, thus I have applied some post-processing devices that would easily allow me to print the image at 13x19 inches. It acquired a much more graphic quality, but that's OK when bicycles hide, comics style ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If you're interested in the post-processing done, drop me a comment.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/mick-jagger-hide-away-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Hide Away</a>" from Mick Jagger's 2001 solo album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goddess-Doorway-Mick-Jagger/dp/B00005QDWE" target="_blank">Goddess in the Doorway</a>", which probably deserves a prize for worst cover art.
