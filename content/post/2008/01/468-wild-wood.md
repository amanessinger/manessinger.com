What is wild with that wood, you ask? Well, you're right, so let me offer you an alternative:<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080124_162222_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080124_162222_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> While the preceding image was shot at f11, this one was taken at f2.8. Both of course with the Sigma 70/2.8 again. Some more typical macro shots ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the fabulous "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/paul-weller-wild-wood-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Wild Wood</a>" by Paul Weller, once of Jam fame, long since a solo star. You can either have it on his 1994 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Wood-Paul-Weller/dp/B000001FI1" target="_blank">Wild Wood</a>" or on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-Wood-Paul-Weller/dp/B000025C3V" target="_blank">Live Wood</a>" from the same year. Hear a very good live version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcaCwKvMyfs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
