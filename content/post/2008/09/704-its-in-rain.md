No, I won't complain about the weather. There's worse than what rain we have. It rains at the moment, but it is supposed to stop in the night or at least tomorrow.<br/><br/>I still use the 50/1.8, I still photograph from under the umbrella, and when everything else fails, I can always play the old color game. A blue car, a yellow/orange shop, that's it for today.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/enya-it-s-in-the-rain-lyrics.html" target="_blank">It's In The Rain</a>" from Enya's 2005 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amarantine-Enya/dp/B000B8QEYC" target="_blank">Amarantine</a>".
