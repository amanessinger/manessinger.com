<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080910_085356_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080910_085356_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Once Austria was a big empire, and though its time was almost over when the Parliament was built, they put every splendor in it, and so even its posterior looks grand. <br/><br/>This is where it's supposed to happen, this is what the election campaigns circle around. This is the place that gets its refill on September 28, and this is why reason is in such short supply these days and populism abounds. I'm going to vote, but I suppose the percentage of voters will drop once again. The campaigns are just too disgusting, the lies just too obvious, the stupidity just too blatant.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/talking-heads-the-democratic-circus-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Democratic Circus</a>" from the widely unpopular last Talking Heads album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Talking-Heads/dp/B000CCD0H6" target="_blank">Naked</a>". Sorry, no video, no sound sample.<br/><br/>Btw: one of the commenters on Amazon credits the "decline" of the Talking Heads to the fact that "Byrne's ego really got the better of him". How's that? An artist with an ego? What did he expect where art comes from? Sometimes I really wonder ðŸ™‚
