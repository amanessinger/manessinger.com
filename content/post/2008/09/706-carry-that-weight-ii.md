<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080918_083703_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080918_083703_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Yesterday, Thursday, was bicycle day again. First I found the one in the Image of the Day, standing on the street in the morning light, the plastic box on the baggage holder glowing against the sun, while its owner delivered newspapers. Remember when the monopolies of the public postal services in Europe fell? They were right! <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080918_084813_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080918_084813_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Newspaper distribution is cheaper now. It is now done by swarms of Pakistani (at least I suppose, by their looks, sorry if I hurt anybodies feelings) on bicycles. Hmm ... now, what exactly could be the reason for the cheaper services? Huh??<br/><br/>The second image is ... strange. I suppose it's kind of a joke, at least the bicycle was just hanging there in five feet height.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080918_134732_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080918_134732_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The final image, the snake, is part of a window grill of the basement windows of Vienna's Palace of Justice. Looks dangerous, no?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is again the Beatles classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beatles/carry+that+weight_10025915.html" target="_blank">Carry That Weight</a>", originally from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abbey-Road-Beatles/dp/B000002UB3" target="_blank">Abbey Road</a>". We had it in "<a href="/2007/09/340-carry-that-weight.html" target="_blank">340 - Carry That Weight</a>", but today we look at the somewhat peculiar version on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beatles-Go-Baroque/dp/B000056PQ2" target="_blank">Beatles Go Baroque</a>" by Peter Breiner and His Chamber Orchestra. I love that album, and when you've heard into the sound samples at <a href="http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid=5446" target="_blank">Classics Online</a>, you will as well ðŸ™‚
