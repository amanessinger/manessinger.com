Bad times for photography.<br/><br/>This is what I managed to get. I tried one other image but failed post-processing it. In this image of the gate of an old factory I used sharpness masks again, but in an even more subtle way, thus it is hard to make it into a tutorial. The differences would be much less than substantial. I'll keep that for an image where I can make the effect more pronounced. In short, the idea is to make a mask that is much like an edge mask that you use for sharpening, only blurrier. You can then use that mask to better keep sharp foreground and blurry background apart. You could, for instance, increase subject contract and decrease background contrast, drive colors to different saturation, make the subject warmer and the background cooler, etc. I have used all that in "<a href="/2008/09/690-flowers-and-apples.html" target="_blank">690 - Flowers and Apples</a>", and some of it I have used here as well.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/Factory.html" target="_blank">Factory</a>"  from Bruce Springsteen's 1978 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darkness-Edge-Town-Bruce-Springsteen/dp/B0000025D0" target="_blank">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>". There are some versions of it on YouTube, at the moment I prefer this intimate one <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqe2DR_v8HQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">with The Seeger Sessions Band</a>.
