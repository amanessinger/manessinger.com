Not that the B&amp;W JPEG was bad, but I decided to try working on it in color, just to see where I get. Well, that's one of the advantages of shooting RAW. Whatever you set your camera to, the RAW file is still raw sensor data, and of course all color information is still there.<br/><br/>The result: just as with yesterday's images there is nothing wrong with this. At ISO 6400 a color image certainly needs some work to look this good, but it is no problem either. Verdict: ISO 6400 is usable as well, at least in good light. Night shots definitely deteriorate easier.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/2541/blrjohns.htm#When475">When You Got A Good Friend</a>" by Robert Johnson. Now, looking at the lyrics, I see that this probably does not describe exactly what the relationship between Erich and me is, but, oh well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I have the Robert Johnson original on disc 47 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>".
