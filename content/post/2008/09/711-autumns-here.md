I like to keep my lenses for some days, like to get into their way of seeing. I am in no way a fanatic. If it's a zoom, I use it as a zoom, if it's a prime, I zoom with my feet. I do have a slight preference for fast primes though. At the moment it's the Sigma 20/1.8, just because I had it still mounted from yesterday's gloomy, rainy afternoon.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080923_084338_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080923_084338_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The first image for today is a composition that I kinda like, although I liked it even more with two people, a man and a woman, crossing in the background. I had waited for the perfect moment, all positions were exactly how they needed to be, the image was balanced and ... focus was all wrong. I wanted it on the bicycle but got it on the background. Oh well.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was shot some minutes earlier on a street corner with a flower shop. They sell tiny pumpkins for decoration, but of course when you get in very near, everything becomes big.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/hawksley-workman-autumn-s-here-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Autumn's Here</a>" from Hawksley Workman's 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lover-Fighter-Hawksley-Workman/dp/B0000C9ZSY" target="_blank">Lover / Fighter</a>". See him perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8i-SCxfaeM&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
