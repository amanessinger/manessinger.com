Thus art is a concept and that concept involves a process... which also means that I no longer think that epiphany is an instantaneous moment when the stars explode and Archimedes runs naked down the streets screaming, "Eureka!".<br/><br/>Oh, perhaps in geological time the process happens in an instant, but in reality it can happen in hours or over days don't you think?</span></blockquote>Yes, that's what I think, and sometimes it comes easier, sometimes it comes harder. This was hard.<br/><br/>This image of a hanger was taken on Sunday afternoon in Carinthia. Normally I don't stop photographing until I have at least one safe bet for an Image of the Day, but on Sunday exactly that had happened. This was nothing but an uninspired warmup image in bad light. No problem, because I would go to a fair and there I would certainly find photographic opportunity aplenty, right? Wrong. It did not happen, and suddenly I found myself in an awkward situation with nothing but a hanger, not even inspiration.<br/><br/>This is the result of my third attempt at making it an image. The first drove all colors apart and to max, the second found this gaudy and converted to B&amp;W, and the third revealed color again. Well, I guess I like it at last ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Struggle" from Apocalyptica's 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Apocalyptica/dp/B00005R8CI" target="_blank">Cult</a>".
