It's extremely uncomfortable, impossible to sleep, so, what better could I do but blogging ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The announced end of summer really hit on Saturday, temperatures fell by 15 centigrades in one day, but I still went swimming - in the rain. It was nice, the water was still warm, and it was much needed after a day of sweat-inducing work (have you ever packed some three or four thousand books and transported them?), and I'll try it again next weekend, that's for sure. No way I could give up so early ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image was shot from out of the car using the Nikon 85/1.8 at f1.8 with a polarizer. You can't see the rain, because the focal plane is so far away, but it was enough to keep me from getting out.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/ella-fitzgerald-early-autumn-lyrics.html">Early Autumn</a>". I have it on Ella Fitzgerald's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Ella-Fitzgerald-Song-Books/dp/B0000046RN">Johnny Mercer Songbook</a>", but the only vocal version that I've found on YouTube is by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMzRr9faOR0">Jo Stafford</a>. Slightly different stuff.
