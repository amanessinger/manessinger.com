From then on it went only down ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080915_165051.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080915_165051.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Having been in a hurry in the morning, I was in the bad position to not have a single usable image, and when I left work in the afternoon, it was broodingly dark with heavy rain. <br/><br/>In such cases I sometimes go home and shoot some <a href="/2007/08/311-il-combattimento.html" target="_blank">Chess</a> or Go pieces (<a href="/2007/11/395-warrior.html" target="_blank">or both</a>), but most of the time I try to get something anyway. So I did this Monday afternoon.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080915_165350.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080915_165350.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> It's funny how conditioned we are. All the time we hear that a rainy day is "Bad Weather", but of course this is not entirely true, at least not when you go photographing. In fact, there is a lot to like in rainy days. Well, at least I tell myself so, because it's predicted to go on that way for the rest of the week ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080915_165435.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080915_165435.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> When walking around under an umbrella, it is convenient to use a physically short, light lens, thus I mounted the Nikon 50/1.8 before leaving work. I like that cheap lens. It is of high quality, sharp as a razor and easily the best value for any photographer.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080915_170323_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080915_170323_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> When shooting in rain, it is always a good idea to consider a polarizer, because it gives you the opportunity to cut out much of the glare, but in this case I wanted to show off the rain, thus a polarizer would have been counterproductive and it would have been much more prone to catch rain drops than the recessed front element of the 50/1.8.<br/><br/>I finally settled with the last image that I shot on my 20 minutes walk around six blocks: the jumble of bicycles, a complication of eight ellipses.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Why So Complicated?" from San Francisco based Jazz pianist and Afro-Cuban band leader Omar Sosa's 2000 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005CEMV" target="_blank">Prietos</a>". I have no lyrics and the sound sample does not prove it, but the only line sung is the title anyway.
