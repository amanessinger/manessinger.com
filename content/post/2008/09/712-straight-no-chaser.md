Well, this is the same place and the war goes on ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080924_182338.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080924_182338.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> This post had many inspirations. Faced by the new Canon 5D MkII, you can feel a certain tension in the Nikon crowd ðŸ™‚ Everybody expected a 24 megapixel camera for Photokina, and what did we get? A 50/1.4. It may be fine, but I doubt it will be better than the new Sigma 50/1.4, though smaller and lighter. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080924_182621.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080924_182621.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Paul Lester recently wrote a clever post, "<a href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/?p=1921" target="_blank">Avoiding occasional G.A.S cramps</a>", where he fights the lust for a D700 by using the D300 that he has. I have the slight suspicion that he is <a href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/?p=1928" target="_blank">not yet really over it</a>, at least he still reassures himself. Paul, let me tell you, that's only the other side of G.A.S. ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080924_183550.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080924_183550.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The other inspiration was <a href="http://www.janine-l-thun.de/" target="_blank">Janine L. Thun</a> from Hamburg. She has a beautiful <a href="http://1-photo-a-day.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">daily photoblog</a>, and in private conversation she asked me about the D300, considering buying one. I talked about my project to get a D700, and that way I arrived at my statement that, although high ISO is absolutely fine on the D300, ISO 6400 is not usable any more, and if at all, then only in B&amp;W. She asked me for samples at 6400 and, well, here we are.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080924_183139.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080924_183139.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Reassurance? Click on any of the images. They all are JPEGs straight out of the camera. No Photoshop, no cropping, no nothing. I have set the camera to picture style "Monochrome" with a slight yellow tint applied, ISO 6400, and that was it.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080924_082447.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080924_082447.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> It's interesting what happens when you take ISO and noise out of the equation. Not that there is so much noise to begin with, at least at the sizes that I display here. It is a wholly new style of shooting, carefree.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080924_193550.JPG" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080924_193550.JPG" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> There is something pleasant to the noise these new Nikon cameras produce. It began with the D200, and since then Nikon has perfected this film grain like look. I guess I will experiment with post-processing such images, because of course they may need some cropping, they may need a vignette applied, they may be material for any kind of my usual tricks, but what I have seen so far has made me feel very comfortable with my camera. Which may or may not preclude me from buying the D700 ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "Straight, No Chaser" from Thelonious Monk's 1961 live album "Thelonious Monk in Italy".
