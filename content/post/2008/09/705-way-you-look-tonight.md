I finally found a yellowish/orange Vespa scooter, but it would not pose as I needed it. It was impossible to separate from the grown-up motorcycles around it, and thus I used it as a diffuse foreground.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rodstewart/thewayyoulooktonight.html" target="_blank">The Way You Look Tonight</a>" from Bryan Ferry's wonderful 1999 album of standards, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/As-Time-Goes-Bryan-Ferry/dp/B00001ZSTJ" target="_blank">As Time Goes By</a>". I have no luck with this album, nobody put the song on YouTube and the sound sample from <a href="http://www.lastfm.de/music/Bryan+Ferry/_/The+way+you+look+tonight" target="_blank">last.fm</a> covers only the instrumental intro, but at least if you are a resident of the US, you may be able to hear it on <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/bryanferry/astimegoesby/thewayyoulooktonight" target="_blank">Rhapsody.com</a>. At least that's what I think, I can't check.
