It's interesting to be on the streets again. One would think that a mere week can't possibly make a difference, but, believe me, it can.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080908_160713.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080908_160713.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> On my way to or from work I don't have tons of time either, no, time is not what makes the difference. It's the wild variety, some would say the chaos of the big city. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the joy was marred by the fact that I had some problem with my right contact lens. I had probably got something into the eye, it happens at times, especially with wind on the streets, and normally this goes away all by itself. This time I may not have had enough sleep the night before (which makes the eyes rather dry), or it may just have been bad luck, whatever, instead of stopping it got worse. I finally had to leave work early.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080908_154646_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080908_154646_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> When I came out into the streets, it did not exactly help. The wind made the pain unbearable, and I had to go to an optician to buy a lens case and some lens fluid. I removed the right lens, stowed it away and then went home.<br/><br/>It's funny, just at that day I had read an article about the "leading eye" and how many left-eyed photographers are trained to use their right eye (sorry, can't remember where, it was a link on some of the 80+ sites that I currently follow, but not one of those sites itself). Now, my leading eye is the right, the one that was now practically useless, or maybe I should say blind at 7.5 diopters. Thus all the images that you see here were shot left-eyed ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beautiful+south/old+red+eyes+is+back_20015207.html" target="_blank">Old Red Eyes Is Back</a>" from the 1992 Beautiful South album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/0898-Beautiful-South/dp/B000005ISB" target="_blank">0898</a>".
