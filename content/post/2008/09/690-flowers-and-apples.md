<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080902_134857_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080902_134857_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This is the image for Tuesday. It's tough at the moment, I hardly find time to take photographs and much less to work on them, as  I am in the process of moving to Villach. That's only 20km west of where I live now, but 90% of the work of moving is independent of distance.<br/><br/>Anyway. I shot this image in the early afternoon, and in post-processing it, I found a new and interesting technique that I call "sharpness masks". I really should have made this a tutorial, but I lack all energy at the moment.<br/><br/>By the way, <a href="http://digitalprotalk.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David Ziser</a> was so kind to link to "<a href="/2008/08/683-welcome-to-republic.html" target="_blank">683 - Welcome To The Republic</a>". Thanks David, it caused a nice spike in my statistics ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If you don't know David (well, of course you do, but let's just assume you don't), he is a leading wedding photo professional from Kentucky, a fantastic teacher, a nice guy, one of the participants in <a href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/" target="_blank">Fine Art Photoblog</a>, and he is probably the most productive blogger whom I've ever seen. I keep struggling with one entry per day, but on good days David produces three or four, and they are definitely worth reading. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "I Ate Up The Apple Tree" from Dr. John's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/NAwlinz-Dis-dUdda-Dr-John/dp/B0001XQ6FE" target="_blank">N'Awlinz: Dis Dat or d'Udda</a>". Sorry, no lyrics, no video.
