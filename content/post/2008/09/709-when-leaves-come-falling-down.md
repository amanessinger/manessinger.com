Sunday. I did not do an awful lot besides working on images and writing blog entries.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080921_165142_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080921_165142_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I had wanted to go swiming once again, but when I finally could rouse myself to even consider going out, it was already 4pm, not really sunny any more, and it already began to get cooler. I decided to stay home.<br/><br/>Earlier that day, while having breakfast on the terrace, I had seen an interesting leaf, thus I mounted the Sigma 70/2.8 and tried four different arrangements of leaves, flowers and an apple. These are the two that I liked most.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/van-morrison-when-the-leaves-come-falling-down-lyrics.html" target="_blank">When The Leaves Come Falling Down</a>" from Van Morrison's 1999 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-Top-Van-Morrison/dp/B0010DJ1JC" target="_blank">Back on Top</a>". See him perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjmO7jJaOvk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
