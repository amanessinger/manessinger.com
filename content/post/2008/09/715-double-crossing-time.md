It is Sunday, September 28, election day in Austria, and before I'll go voting, I have to make something up for yesterday. Why not look a year back? Well, I did, but a year ago was another day when I had trouble coming up with something usable. I tried processing some of the shots but my imagination failed me.<br/><br/>Another year back I found what I was looking for. I may have posted this image on the Radiant Vista, but it never was an Image of the Day, because this was shortly before I began the blog. It's a bit of a cheat, but I guess this image was worth resurrecting.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/bluesbreakers-with-eric-clapton-double-crossing-time-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Double Crossing Time</a>" from the 1966 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bluesbreakers-Clapton-Mayall-Blues-Breakers/dp/B00005K9QP" target="_blank">John Mayall - Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOmMs50m0nA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
