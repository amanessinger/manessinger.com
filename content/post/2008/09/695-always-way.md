I used it to sleep, catch up on my blog and not much else. I planned to have a nice hour of shooting when I'd drive to the lake for swimming. The only trouble was, that when I wanted to begin photographing, I found out, much to my dismay, that I had forgotten the CF card in the card reader. Well, there's a first time for everything ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Thus I have no sunlit landscape in front of a dramatic storm sky, I have only the images that I made within two or three minutes after I returned home. Light was gone, but still, I like this one dearly. I didn't do much in post-processing, it didn't need it. It's quite a beautiful image, if you ask me, and it's a nice way to end the day.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricspy.com/g/Giant_Sand/lyrics/Way_To_End_The_Day/" target="_blank">Way To End The Day</a>" from Giant Sand's 2000 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chore-Enchantment-Giant-Sand/dp/B00003XAA7" target="_blank">Chore of Enchantment</a>".
