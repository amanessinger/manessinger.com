I had only some minutes, and the one thing that immediately caught my attention, was a group of these yellow flowers that we now have all around.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080920_164820_03_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080920_164820_03_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> They are a kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helianthus" target="_blank">sunflower</a>, grow in brushes of up to two meters high, and the flowers are much smaller than those of the archetypical sunflowers.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080920_164935_05_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080920_164935_05_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I don't know when these flowers turned up in Austria, but I am quite sure that we did not have them here in my youth. I suppose they came as garden flowers and now grow in the wild, or maybe they were mixed with seeds. Everything is commercial now, and of course no farmer seeds from last year's crop today. Whatever the reason is, they seem to feel well here. Can anybody enlighten me as to their origin?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/doors/indian+summer_20042708.html" target="_blank">Indian Summer</a>" from the 1970 Doors album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Morrison-Hotel-Doors/dp/B000MG1ZG0" target="_blank">Morrison Hotel</a>". I had the vinyl album and have just ordered the CD. See a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOKAQSGCm8Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
