The apartment in Villach is far from ready, there is ... hmm .. half a kitchen now, part of the book shelves, parts here, parts there, a lot of work and I have not much time to spare for photography. These are the images for Friday. I had taken a day off, intending to take an early train.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080919_124039_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080919_124039_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> These images were shot while still in Vienna. There is a big club/bar in Neubaugasse, "Stylez", that is all red and orange with some black, and as I stood there, I experimented with focusing near, using various foregrounds and angles on the bar.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080919_123951_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080919_123951_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The Song of the Day is not exactly a song, it's a serenade by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, called "Posthorn Serenade". I have it on disc 7 of volume 3 of Mozart's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart-Complete-Works/dp/B000A0HFZS" target="_blank">Complete Works</a>", a 170 CD box, digitally recorded, partly by second tier orchestras, but nevertheless quite OK. In any case it's a fine reference, and even more so for the price of â‚¬99 that I've paid. Amazon sells it quite expensively, so I'd try an alternative source from their marketplace, where you get it new for $117 at the moment.
