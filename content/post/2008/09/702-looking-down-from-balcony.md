A sweet little maple tree, seen from the balcony of the new apartment in Villach saved the day. It will take some more weekends until I have finally moved. Expect more weekends with boring images ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Hmm ... in hindsight I should probably have used the Nikon 18-200 VR and a polarizer instead of the Nikon 70-300 VR for which I have none. Damn!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Sugar Maples" from Clarence Bucaro's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Light-Clarence-Bucaro/dp/B0001XAPO2" target="_blank">Sense of Light</a>". Sorry, no lyrics, no video, but a wholly enjoyable album by an astounding young man.
