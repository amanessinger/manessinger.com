Here's an image that I shot with the Sigma 20/1.8. Fabulous lens. A wide-angle macro lens with wonderful bokeh. <br/><br/>Hmm ... Nikon did not exactly perform as expected this Photokina, did they? Countering Canon's 5D MkII with a new 50/1.4, to be delivered in December? What do they think??<br/><br/>On the other hand, that's great. Were I a Canon shooter, I'd have to ponder about the new 5D and how to rectify an expenditure of â‚¬2700. Meanwhile I see the Nikon D700, introduced at exactly that price point only two months ago, plummeting down to â‚¬2180. Hmm ... this weird lens on an FX camera? Would be nice ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The sticker on the lamppost is an ad for a Viennese band called "<a href="http://www.forbiddenarea.net/" target="_blank">Forbidden Area</a>". I don't know them and can't comment on their music. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricspy.com/g/Giant_Sand/lyrics/Dirty_From_The_Rain/" target="_blank">Dirty From The Rain</a>" from the 2000 Giant Sand album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chore-Enchantment-Giant-Sand/dp/B00003XAA7" target="_blank">Chore of Enchantment</a>". Amazon has no sound samples for the CD, but they have one for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dirty-From-The-Rain/dp/B00171C068" target="_blank">MP3 download</a>. It's an unlucky cut, but you'll get the idea.
