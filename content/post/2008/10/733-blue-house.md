What made me try it was the red accent of the flowers. Immediately above there was white, bright sky, just to the right of the flowers a "For Sale" sign, and my position was restricted because I couldn't possibly stand in the middle of the street. Apart from that I had the Sigma 50/1.4 mounted and did not want to change for one shot. Under these circumstances I am quite satisfied ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Blue House" from Marcia Ball's 1994 album of the same name. The Rolling Stone has a <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/233242/review/5941887/bluehouse" target="_blank">review</a> of the album. Sorry, no lyrics. <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/marciaball" target="_blank">Rhapsody</a> has a Marcia Ball page, but it is US only. I suppose you could hear it there. For the lesser among us there is always the sample on Amazon.
