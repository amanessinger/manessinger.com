Sorry, there's no image of yesterday so far. I have some candidates and don't yet know what to make of them. That's not the point though. <a href="http://www.dxo.com/" target="_blank">DxO</a> released the demo for release 5.3, and that's what I've been fooling around with since. With this release they have finally fulfilled their original promises for version 5. The RAW converter is awesome! <br/><br/>I have never seen better night shots at ISO 1600 from a D200, and what I've seen at ISO 6400 from the D300 (I tried some of the images that I shot in B&W) is spectacular. More to come.
