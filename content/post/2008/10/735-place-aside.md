I already did one similar image some <a href="/2008/10/720-runnin-blue.html" target="_blank">days back</a>, and this time I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. The red of the traffic light in a distance complements the main curve nicely. Post-processing was much more conventional than yesterday, consisting mainly of saturation layers in various blending modes, most importantly "Multiply" for the highlights, and some vignetting.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/beth-orton-a-place-aside-lyrics.html" target="_blank">A Place Aside</a>" from Beth Orton's 2006 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Strangers-Beth-Orton/dp/B000CBSHK2" target="_blank">Comfort of Strangers</a>". There's no video available, but at least Amazon has sound samples.
