I had stayed a little longer in the hope it would stop, but it got only worse. One more time of shooting from under an umbrella.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081016_191221_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081016_191221_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The second image suffers from a weak composition, but I liked the red umbrella, and when I had decided on composition, the subjects were gone. People! Can't they hold their stance until my work is done? ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/eric-clapton-fall-like-rain-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Fall Like Rain</a>" from Eric Clapton's 1998 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pilgrim-Eric-Clapton/dp/B0000062UW" target="_blank">Pilgrim</a>", one of his weaker albums. But judge for yourself on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/23750" target="_blank">Deezer</a>.
