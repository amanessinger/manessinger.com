I shot it on my way to the train, already inside of the station, standing on the stairs to the platform. I fooled around with focusing on the last step, the Sigma 50/1.4 wide open at f1.4, and when I heard a man coming up behind me, I waited until he was exactly in focus.<br/><br/> Well, that's it for today. Oh, and, one more thing: Nikon has released a firmware update for the D300. If you have one, this is not to be missed. They have added some features and corrected some bugs. Most spectacular is what they have done to automatic white balance. It was already good, now it is much better. It's not perfect, and if you want to, it is still easy to fool it, but I have seen some extremely good results under very difficult lighting conditions, mostly mixed light at night or in twilight on the streets. These were situations when the old firmware would definitely have been far off. In other words: Install this!!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/bob-dylan-step-it-up-and-go-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Step It Up And Go</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1992 album "Good as I Been to You". Sorry, no video, no sample but what Amazon has.
