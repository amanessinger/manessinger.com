These are the images of yesterday, Monday. Now, what do I do with this lens? Well, just like with most lenses, I go for shallow depth of field ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081006_135919_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081006_135919_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> On an APS-C sensor, 50 mm are a nice focal length for portraits, and in fact this is an excellent portrait lens. In this image of my friend Erich I focused on the near eye, and that's pretty much all that is sharp in this image. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081006_083708_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081006_083708_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The pumpkins are a morning image, taken in exactly the same spot as "<a href="/2008/09/711-autumns-here.html">711 - Autumn's Here</a>", in front of a flower shop in Lerchenfelder StraÃŸe. <br/><br/>It's Tuesday evening now, and although I have some images for today, you won't see them today and maybe not even tomorrow. When I came home, I found that my computer had died, thus there is no Photoshop today. I write this from a Linux system on my second PC, but of course I have no Photoshop CS3 on Linux. I'll take the Laptop home from work tomorrow, and if I manage to do so, I may have a new computer by tomorrow evening, but I already shudder from the thought of installing all my software. Oh dear!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, matching the dream-like scene in my Image of the Day, is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/lisa-ekdahl-deep-inside-your-dreams-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Deep inside your Dreams</a>" from Lisa Ekdahl's 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heaven-Earth-Beyond-Lisa-Ekdahl/dp/B00006SI2Y" target="_blank">Heaven Earth &amp; Beyond</a>".
