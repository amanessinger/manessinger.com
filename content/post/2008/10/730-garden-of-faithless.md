Promised: I'll keep this very short and apolitical, OK? I'm back in Vienna, I have all my images with me again but still no Photoshop installed. Oh my!<br/><br/>This is an image from today. I went into the garden and took some images of the Cherry tree that just now has wonderful colors. I'm afraid it will have lost its leaves by next weekend.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "The Garden" from the 1999 Faithless album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sunday-8pm-Faithless/dp/B0002L30GS" target="_blank">Sunday 8pm</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyaIb5MC4JY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. There are no lyrics, it's instrumental ðŸ™‚
