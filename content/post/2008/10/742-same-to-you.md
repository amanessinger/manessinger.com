Not much art on my side here and nothing about DxO either. The review continues as soon as I have it installed here in Carinthia (it's a pain over my slow and not very reliable connection), or otherwise am back in Vienna. Have a nice weekend.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Oh, How The Ghost Sings" from the 1981 Lester Bowie album "The Great Pretender". No video, of course, but the sound sample at Amazon will give you an idea ðŸ™‚
