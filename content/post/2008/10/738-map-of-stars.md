Uhhh ... what could I come up with? Wait a minute ... yes! That's it. Traveling with a bag full of lenses, but leaving your camera behind! Oh dear, I've left my D300 along with the Sigma 50/1.4 in Carinthia, only to be recovered on Friday. <br/><br/>There are two roads from here ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Probably I'll never get a better excuse for buying a D700. On the other hand, reason tells me that I currently spend so much money in that moving adventure, that I'd better not.<br/><br/>Normally I'm strictly adverse to listening to reason, but this time I did. When I sold my D200, almost a year ago, I secured the option to borrow it back should need be. Then I had thought of the D300 being sent in for service or such, but now it comes handy as well.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081020_152805_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081020_152805_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Here we are. Today's images were shot with a D200. It's still an incredibly capable camera. Apparent differences are the LCD and the much more sluggish scrolling in full zoom, but when I had it, I did not miss any speed. It's only that the D300 is much faster and you get accustomed to that.<br/><br/>Both images were shot within five meters distance where Burggasse meets <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.204598,16.353031&spn=0.005735,0.013947&t=h&z=17" target="_blank">Sankt-Ulrichs-Platz</a> and I'm quite pleased with both of them. The leaves were not arranges, but I admit having removed some peripheral distractions, most of them physically while being there ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the incredibly beautiful "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/melissa-etheridge-map-of-the-stars-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Map Of The Stars</a>" from Melissa Etheridge's 2007 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Awakening-Melissa-Etheridge/dp/B000TKCNQA" target="_blank">The Awakening</a>".
