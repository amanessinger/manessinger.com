These are two images from Tuesday, the actual birthday, and I'd like to thank all my readers. Some of you have been with me almost from the beginning, some for a long time, and some have joined only lately. I hope this will go on and you will continue to come in for some visual food.<br/><br/><a href="http://1-photo-a-day.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Janine</a> was so kind as to give me a present, a funny, crazy birthday bicycle found in Amsterdam. Can you imagine a bicycle jumping with excitement?? Head over to <a href="http://1-photo-a-day.blogspot.com/2008/10/111-congratulation.html" target="_blank">her blog</a> to find out ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081014_165958_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081014_165958_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The Song of the Day is again Stevie Wonder's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/stevie+wonder/happy+birthday_20131794.html" target="_blank">Happy Birthday</a>", originally on the 1980 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hotter-Than-July-Stevie-Wonder/dp/B00004SZWB" target="_blank">Hotter Than July</a>". The video on YouTube that I've linked to last year has been removed, another one is not available in my country (Gosh, this industry is so stupid!) but of course there are countless other versions like this concert <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rszcDrVeu3Q" target="_blank">video</a>.
