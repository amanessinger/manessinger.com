Really not wanting to say anything, wanting to shut up, lay down and sleep? Well, I'm really, really tired, so please bear with me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This is a morning image, one of the few, the only one that I would consider.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/aaron-neville-i-ve-done-it-again-lyrics.html" target="_blank">I've Done It Again</a>" from Aaron Neville's 1989 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Show-Me-Way-Aaron-Neville/dp/B00000365K" target="_blank">Show Me The Way</a>". Hear the whole song on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/194493" target="_blank">Deezer</a> - and please tell me if you have trouble hearing it. After all <a href="http://www.deezer.com" target="_blank">Deezer</a> is a French service.
