This means we're headin' for a fall gals! I've made some pictures of a foggy park, they are even not so bad, but I'll spare us the clichÃ©. It's autumn, summer's long gone and that must suffice.<br/><br/>This is an image that I shot on my way home. It is not the first image that I've taken of this venerable motorbike, but it is the first that gets published.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pogues/dirty+old+town_20109784.html" target="_blank">Dirty Old Town</a>" - not the David Byrne song from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rei-Momo-David-Byrne/dp/B000002LIV" target="_blank">Rei Momo</a>", not the Rod Steward version, no, it's the Pogues that who have it on their 1985 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rum-Sodomy-Lash-Pogues/dp/B000H8SFMA" target="_blank">Rum, Sodomy &amp; the Lash</a>". See the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVUZuVZWHkk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. This is a true classic, you don't want to miss it ðŸ™‚
