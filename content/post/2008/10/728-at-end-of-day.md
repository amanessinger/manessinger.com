You can only get done so much on Saturdays, and this weekend we needed to buy a lot of things. Thus I spent the whole Friday - and it was a wonderful, sunny day - in shopping malls. Nine hours of shopping! Some people seem to enjoy it, at least that's what the advertising for those shopping centers tells, but - honestly - I don't.<br/><br/>Both of today's images were shot within some minutes at and shortly after sundown. The Image of the Day is the wall of the last shop that I visited. I came out and imediately saw that I had only about two or three minutes of golden light left, certainly not enough to go for any other place. I took some architectural shots, this is the best of them.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081010_183227_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081010_183227_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The other image, well, that's how the day ended after nine hours of shopping. Fitting, in a way.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beck/end+of+the+day_20015360.html" target="_blank">End Of The Day</a>" from Beck's 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sea-Change-Beck/dp/B00006F7S4" target="_blank">Sea Change</a>".
