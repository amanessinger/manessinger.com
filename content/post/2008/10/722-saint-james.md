I tried to merge the JPEGs in Photoshop, but what I tried to do to the sky led to pixelation. Merging the RAW files, on the other hand, made my computer go out of virtual memory. Hmm ... 32 RAW files are no slouch, me thinks. Well, I'll show it to you when I find out how to do it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image is from the afternoon. After a whole day of work I spent the minutes of late sun in the supermarket near my new home, but who says that you can't make a nice image after actual sundown? It's just another bad match for a 50/1.4 though. My 50/1.8 for a quarter of the price had done it just as well.<br/><br/>This is Sankt Jakob im Rosental, Saint James in English, a village on one of the countless pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela. The Song of the Day? Of course "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/v/van+morrison/saint+james+infirmary_10169594.html" target="_blank">Saint James Infirmary</a>", on my disk interpreted by Dr. John on his 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/NAwlinz-Dis-dUdda-Dr-John/dp/B0001XQ6FE" target="_blank">N'Awlinz: Dis Dat or d'Udda</a>", on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJA21UmUquI" target="_blank">YouTube</a> to be seen as a collaboration of Dr. John and Eric Clapton. Mmmm .... Tasty ðŸ™‚
