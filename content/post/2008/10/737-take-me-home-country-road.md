<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081019_163928_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20081019_163928_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Today was a sunny Sunday. I was out taking photographs for about an hour, and although the idea was originally to make typical autumn landscape images, in the end, whatever I did, I did not like the colors, they always looked banal and I decided to convert this image to B&amp;W with a rich, brown toning.<br/><br/>I have only one one version of the Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-take-me-home-country-road-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Take Me Home Country Road</a>", and that's by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole on the 1993 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facing-Future-Israel-Kamakawiwoole/dp/B00000JFG3" target="_blank">Facing Future</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPH1ue0Gpo" target="_blank">YouTube</a> ðŸ™‚
