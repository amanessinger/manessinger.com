<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081009_083206_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20081009_083206_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This is the last batch of images that I processed yesterday on the train. Both were shot in the morning. The bicycles in the Image of the Day stood in front of a school with attached kindergarten in Vienna's JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe. I found that they had something ... cool, a kind of adolescent charm and recklessness. I instantly thought of a gang.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081009_084218_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081009_084218_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The other image is of some shop for exotic furniture. They advertise end-of-summer sales (furniture??) in big letters written over their windows and they have two banners, one orange, one light green outside, along with the dark green of the wood. I go that way almost daily, it's a short distance from work, and I have tried for quite some time now to put that impression into a photo. It's a little awkward to isolate from the surroundings, but I guess I've made it this time. That's what there is, that's the essence, that's what catches your eye from a distance, even when the surroundings would not. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/morrissey/first+of+the+gang+to+die_10183672.html" target="_blank">First Of The Gang To Die</a>" from the stellar 2004 Morrissey album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Are-Quarry-Morrissey/dp/B0006IIP3A" target="_blank">You Are the Quarry</a>". This is a song about youthful, reckless heroism, a story about some young Hector, who was "the first of the gang with gun in his hand and the first to do time, the first of the gang to die". A story about one who "stole from the rich and the poor and the not-very-rich and the very poor" and a story about one who "stole all hearts away". It's a story of love, crime, tragic heroism and ridicule. It's a song about all the richness of life. <br/><br/>There are at least five versions on YouTube, I suggest to begin with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzpynvxr7tA&feature=related" target="_blank">original video</a> ðŸ™‚
