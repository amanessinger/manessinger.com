In a comment <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ted</a> asked me to not only show the bikes but also the riders.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080930_080135_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080930_080135_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Well, last morning, immediately after I had left the tram, I saw these two guys passing by, newspapers in their baskets, I remembered Ted, tried my luck and even got sort of a decent shot. Gosh, that's not easy. You can't plan anything ... <br/><br/>... or maybe you can. Of course I know some spots now where lurking for some minutes would almost certainly produce a result ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080930_080727_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080930_080727_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Only meters on I found this ribbon on the radio antenna of a parking car. Must have been to a wedding, although at weddings the ribbons are normally some variant of white. <br/><br/>All images today were made with the Nikon 85/1.8, a lens that has been severely underused yet. The riders were shot at f8, this from minimum focusing distance (which is about a poor 80 cm) at f4, the others wide open at f1.8.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080930_172528_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080930_172528_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> There are three reasons why this lens did not get enough attention so far. One is that I bought the Nikon 70-300 VR only two weeks later, and of course the 300 mm were more spectacular. <br/><br/>The second reason is, that this lens shows strong purple fringing (like many old Nikon designs seem to) when used wide open and in extreme contrasts.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080930_172315_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080930_172315_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The third reason is, that in terms of focal length this lens is not very far from the Sigma 70/2.8 Macro, but the Sigma is the by far better and much more versatile lens. <br/><br/>So, why on earth do I use the Nikon 85/1.8 at all?? Well, I like variety, and used for what it's good at, this lens can produce remarkable results.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Red Ribbon" from Mary Coughlan's 1990 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncertain-Pleasures-Mary-Coughlan/dp/B000024G6X" target="_blank">Uncertain Pleasures</a>". Amazon has no sound samples, but I found the whole song on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/track/red-ribbon-T687076" target="_blank">Deezer</a>, an online music service that I did not know before. They let me hear the whole song, and in contrast to Pandora or Rhapsody they let me hear it although I am not a citizen of the United States. <br/><br/>It's a French service and their music search is currently more than a little flaky. So far I have not registered with them, because I can't currently see what the benefit would be and their terms of use are displayed in French. Anyway, I could hear the song, that's what counts and I hope you can hear it too.
