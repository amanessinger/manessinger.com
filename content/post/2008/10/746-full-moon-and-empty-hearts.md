It's 5am, Thursday morning, these are the images of Tuesday. I left work at 4:30pm, but since we have switched from daylight saving time last Sunday night, it's dark time of the year again.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081028_093650_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081028_093650_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The first image is actually a morning image. I really can't get enough of these bicycles, and this is a particularly twisted pose. This was one safe bet for an Image of the Day, and that's something I really like: knowing there is something to fall back. I gives me a certain peace of mind that can again spark creativity.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081028_175205_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081028_175205_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The second image is actually an old acquaintance. I remember having used this tattered mannequin in Neubaugasse at least three times now. I like the shop, it always displays nice colors for gray winter evenings.<br/><br/>I don't know if the Image of the Day would have been Image of the Day without the title. Searching for a song fitting one of the three images, I looked at this empty space, searched for the word "empty", and when I found "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/frank-sinatra-full-moon-and-empty-arms-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Full Moon And Empty Arms</a>" on an obscure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mina_Mazzini" target="_blank">Mina</a> album called "Summertime" (that I can't find online, even in the discography on her very own site) I first mis-read it as "Full Moon And Empty Hearts" - and fell in love. Later, when I found out about my mistake, I decided to keep it at that. <br/><br/>"Full Moon and Empty Arms" is a 1945 popular song by Buddy Kaye and Ted Mossman, best-known in its rendition by Frank Sinatra and based on Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. Mina's recording is from an 1964 album "<a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1395384/a/Americana.htm" target="_blank">Americana</a>", and to hear a one minute sample, please <a href="http://www.minamazzini.com/news/" target="_blank">go to her own site</a>, enter "full moon" in the search field atop, and then click "Play audio". You'll need a Quicktime plugin to do so.
