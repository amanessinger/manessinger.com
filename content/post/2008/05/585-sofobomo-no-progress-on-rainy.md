It was a rainy, gloomy day, I had supposed to make big strides in editing SoFoBoMo images, but instead I lay down early (just for an hour) - and slept till morning. Thus: no progress.<br/><br/>This image was shot down from out of my living room window. Yesterday that was all creativity that I could muster. Forget about yesterday. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is a Blues. It must be. "Rainy Tuesday" from the 1963 Alexis Korner album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alexis-Korners-Blues-Incorporated/dp/B000FIGZCY">Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated</a>". A video? You're kidding!
