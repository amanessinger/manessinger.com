I still had the Sigma 10-20 mounted and I said to myself, heck, why not try using that lens in the streets again? I haven't done that in a long time, and it sure felt ... alien? <br/><br/>Well, you must know that I use the 10-20mm zoom mostly like a 10mm prime. Normally I zoom this lens only if I absolutely must. I simply love the wild abundance of lines, the distortions, the unreal effects that you get.<br/><br/>Only that it didn't work that way yesterday. In fact, this is the only image that I feel confident of releasing. I like the split-toned B&amp;W version better than the original. It has a more old-fashioned look, something that contrasts nicely with the rather not so conventional distortions. All in all I think it's a nice result for a day that saw me completely at odds with my lens and uninspired as well.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/richard_hawley/coles_corner.html" target="_blank">Coles Corner</a>", the title song of Richard Hawley's 2005 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coles-Corner-Richard-Hawley/dp/B000AA4LN2" target="_blank">album of the same name</a>.
