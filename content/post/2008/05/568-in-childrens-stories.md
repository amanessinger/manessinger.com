Old, mossy trees seam the way, exciting things happen all the time and, wait, there's more to it. These are not only the ways of the stories, these are the ways of my childhood memories as well. I wonder if this is the archetype of a way, wired into us from times when the whole world was a forest and proper ways did not even exist.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-children-s-story-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Children's Story</a>", Tom Waits' rendition of the story told in Georg BÃ¼chner's "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woyzeck" target="_blank">Woyzeck</a>". "Blood Money" is Waits' "Woyzeck" album, but this song is from the 2006 masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Fold-out-Digipak-24-page-booklet/dp/B000L43AN4" target="_blank">Orphans</a>".
