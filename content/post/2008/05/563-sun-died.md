This is the image for Monday.<br/><br/>On Monday I didn't achieve much. I made a very nice portrait that I can't show, photographed a fantastically colored pattern of green chairs in front of an orange background, but somehow I framed it in a way that I can't salvage the image, regardless of what I do, and at the end of the day, while eating at my favorite Greek restaurant, I watched the sun dying. This is what made it. Don't ask me why I framed it like I did. I couldn't tell you why. It simply ... feels right ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/t/thesundied.shtml" target="_blank">The Sun Died</a>" from Betty Carter's 1969 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Finally-Betty-Carter/dp/B000005HGC" target="_blank">Finally</a>".
