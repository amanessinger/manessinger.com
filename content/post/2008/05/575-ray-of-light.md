Saturday afternoon I was out photographing for an hour, nothing special, only some wide-angle landscapes, but the really spectacular thing was, what I saw when I returned home.<br/><br/>Situations like these are really impossible to photograph. The dynamic range exceeds everything that sensors or film can record, yes, it exceeds even the range of the human eye. I had made two exposures, one with a completely burned out sky and a second with most of the sky intact, but everything else pretty lost in darkness.<br/><br/>The two exposures were from slightly different points of view and impossible to combine. I've decided to use the second one, the dark one. This is a 14 layer job with 8 distinct masks, but ultimately I think I made it. It's pretty amazing what enormous reserves the RAW files of Nikon's D300 have.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/madonna-ray-of-light-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Ray Of Light</a>" from Madonna's 1998 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ray-Light-Madonna/dp/B000002NJS" target="_blank">album</a> of the same title.
