Well, you wouldn't have guessed ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It's easy to see why. A bicycle has a very simple architecture. Straight lines in the frame, ellipses as wheels, and then there are these wonderful curves in the cables of the brakes. Take these simple lines and some lines of pavement, a wall or other such elementary pieces of architecture, and you can do all sorts of geometric tricks with them. And then there are these angles that bicycles take, when leaning against a wall or a signpost. It always looks somehow cool and ... twisted?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/lambert-hendricks-and-ross-twisted-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Twisted</a>", is from Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross 1959 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hottest-New-Group-Jazz/dp/B000002ADR" target="_blank">The Hottest New Group in Jazz</a>". I even found a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StDLnFrbi78&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. The divine Annie Ross, accompanied by Count Basie on piano. Not shabby!
