I began early today, at 6:30 am and left work only at 6:00 pm, but thanks to daylight saving time (Oh how I love this!! Why can't we have it all year?), I was still able to get some sunny images.<br/><br/>Sun or not, I finally ended up with this: an oval window in a door, some reflections and some warmly lit stucco inside. Like so many times over the last six months I used my Sigma 70/2.8. What a great lens for walking around and capturing details!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bettemidler/myeyeonyou.html" target="_blank">My Eye On You</a>" from the 1983 Bette Midler album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Frills-Bette-Midler/dp/B000002J5F" target="_blank">No Frills</a>".
