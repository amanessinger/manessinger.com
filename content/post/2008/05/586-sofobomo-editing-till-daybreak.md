I had risen early to write Tuesday's entry, and this is what it looked like, out of my kitchen window. Well, sort of. I had seen the strong color contrast between the artificially lit window frames and the blue outside. I took some images, and when I felt satisfied, I went to the computer and found ... the memory card already in the card reader. I had taken the images into the internal buffer, and when I turned the camera off, they were gone. Oh well, there's a first time for everything, I guess ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Of course, when I returned to the kitchen, the light was gone. What you see here is a careful and thorough reconstruction of what it would have looked like when taken earlier. No problem, just a little work with color temperature, color relations and tonal values. Why easy when you can have it the hard way?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080517_165005_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080517_165005_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> SoFoBoMo progresses. Not in wild strides, but it does. Still, I'll have to speed up now. The problem is, while some images come easy, some really need attention. This one, for instance, took me three iterations until I was satisfied with the distribution of light. Now I feel it's perfectly balanced, but that's after more than an hour of work.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080517_165931_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080517_165931_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Another problem is the forest light. I want a wide variety of colors, but there must still be a green cast. I need to control contrasts and I want nice vivid saturation, but without being gaudy. See the problem? Here we have the result of another two hours. And still I have no idea of how to make a book ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lisa_ekdahl/daybreak.html" target="_blank">Daybreak</a>" from Lisa Ekdahl's 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heaven-Earth-Beyond-Lisa-Ekdahl/dp/B00006SI2Y" target="_blank">Heaven Earth &amp; Beyond</a>". No sound samples from Amazon, but at least a commercial with part of the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0r2Afpr1Fs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. A nice song and quite fitting, as I see day break while I write these very words.
