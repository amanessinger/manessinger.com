I was up to something different, but things did not work out as intended. I'll see into it today.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-all-the-world-is-green-lyrics.html" target="_blank">All The World Is Green</a>" from Tom Waits' 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Money-Tom-Waits/dp/B00005YX3K" target="_blank">Blood Money</a>". See him perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zn1K72cxKs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
