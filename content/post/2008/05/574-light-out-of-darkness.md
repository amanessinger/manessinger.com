I've already shown this portrait as a second example in the tutorial for Tuesday, "<a href="/2008/05/571-them-there-eyes-ii.html" target="_blank">571 - Them There Eyes II</a>". On the other hand, this was not the Image of the Day for Tuesday, and the image was actually shot on Friday, as an example for an utterly badly lit portrait, a worst case example, thus the timing is OK, because this is the entry for Friday. And then, apart from the fact that I had nothing better, I am also pretty damn proud of what I've achieved here ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If you are curious now and haven't read the tutorial yet, just follow the link above.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Light Out Of Darkness" from Shirley Horn's 1993 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Light-out-Darkness-Tribute-Charles/dp/B0000046QQ" target="_blank">Light out of Darkness (A Tribute to Ray Charles)</a>". Sorry, neither video nor lyrics are available.
