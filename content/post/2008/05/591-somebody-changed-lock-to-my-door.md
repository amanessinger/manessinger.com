What drew me in, was the pattern of gold and warm, dark green. Is it coincidence that I read the essay "Melancholy Objects" from Susan Sontag's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photography-Susan-Sontag/dp/0312420099" target="_blank">On Photography</a>" right now? <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Somebody Changed The Lock" from the 1972 Dr. John album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Johns-Gumbo-John/dp/B000002I6P" target="_blank">Dr. John's Gumbo</a>".
