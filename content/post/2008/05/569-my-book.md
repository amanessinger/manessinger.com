<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080504_165858_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080504_165858_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>The inspiration to this image came from Ted's post "<a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2008/04/pidgeon.html" target="_blank">Pigeon</a>". There he presented three times four ways to have fun with a lighthouse. All of the images are gorgeous wide angle shots, and one of them has a whale's jaw in the foreground, lying in the grass.<br/><br/>Gosh, I thought, it's a long long time since I last did wide angle. Of the three processing variants that Ted presented, the third - his choice, he called it "heavy metal" - did not really ring with me, but it sparked an idea. In that particular series of images I would have liked a softer variant, but contrasted with an object. Something like the whale's jaw in composition, but an object that would be clearly out of place. A surreal element.<br/><br/>The other thing that led to today's image is, small wonder, the image of yesterday, "<a href="/2008/05/568-in-childrens-stories.html" target="_blank">In Children's Stories</a>". <br/><br/>It was clear now that I'd do a wide angle shot, it was clear that I would do it from the tripod, using HDR if necessary (which it was not), and the idea of the forest, of green filtered light, still kept me.<br/><br/>That was the concept. An image in the forest, and in the foreground an out-of-place object. Now I needed only two things, an object and a place. Thinking of yesterday, I first thought about a children's toy, ideally an old, damaged doll. This would have given an element of danger, but unfortunately I had no doll. Hmm ... must remember to find one.<br/><br/>From there it was not far to the book. It would have to be bound in red, preferably a big old book, if at all possible something that would survive lying on the ground, and so I finally selected the Collected Works of Shakespeare, that I had once bought very cheaply.<br/><br/>The first place that came to my mind was the gorge where I have shot a series of images about 16 months ago (see "<a href="/2007/01/80-quake-in-gorgeous-gorge.html" target="_blank">Quake in a Gorgeous Gorge</a>", "<a href="/2007/01/85-down-again.html" target="_blank">Down Again</a>", "<a href="/2007/01/86-probing-deeper.html" target="_blank">Probing Deeper</a>" and "<a href="/2007/01/87-substitutions.html" target="_blank">Substitutions</a>"). Forest, water, book. Looked good to me. The only problem is, that I have recently seen wood workers around that place. I wanted to avoid any traces of human presence, thus I decided to simply try my luck with a new place.<br/><br/>The first choice was another gorge, but that one was completely inaccessible, at least from the side that I tried. I gave it up for today and instead drove to another place that I know. I have shot "<a href="/2006/11/30-logging-again.html" target="_blank">Logging Again</a>" there and almost a year later "<a href="/2007/10/366-happy-birthday.html" target="_blank">Happy Birthday</a>". There is no water, but the logs would do as well.<br/><br/>On my way there, about two curves before, I found what you see here. Water. Not waterfalls, not even much water, but I absolutely loved how the water repeated yesterday's metaphor of the way. Here we are now.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/the-beautiful-south-my-book-lyrics.html" target="_blank">My Book</a>" from the 1990 Beautiful South album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Choke-Beautiful-South/dp/B0000261BE" target="_blank">Choke</a>". See Paul Heaton perform it in the original video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g1QUWwxsYo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, it's "Richard III" where the book came to rest. Whatever that means.
