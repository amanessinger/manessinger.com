It is an immersing view.<br/><br/>No news on SoFoBoMo. I'm in for some real stress this week ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/the-rolling-stones-thru-and-thru-lyrics.html">Thru And Thru</a>" from the 1994 Rolling Stones album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Voodoo-Lounge-Rolling-Stones/dp/B000000W6L">Voodoo Lounge</a>".
