Who could be upset? In fact, I very much appreciated the time, because sifting through 140 images, not to find one single Image of the Day but to identify and process as many as possible, that's quite a task. As already mentioned, I use Lab processing on all these images, because there's really a need to drive the different shades of green apart. I am not really sure about the colors yet, I may get back and make final adjustments later, but that's easy in Lab.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080517_152038_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080517_152038_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> So far the session looks good to me. I have just counted, and even when I'm really conservative, I can come up with more than 35 usable images. Still, I'll allow myself the luxury to go back next weekend. There will be different light, I may use different lenses or at least I may be in a different mood. <br/><br/>Seems like image making is not my problem. Stringing them together ain't either, because as I have outlined in my <a href="/2008/05/581-sofobomo-at-last.html" target="_blank">kick-off post</a>, the order is already given by the sequence of places along the path. What troubles me, is only that I have no idea so far of how to make a book ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Today's Image of the Day is not from the SoFoBoMo session, it's genuinely from today. Employing the Sigma 70/2.8, I have ventured into the garden, well, more along the wall, just as far as the roof would still cover me, and this was the only flower in reach ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/a/aaronneville74/itfeelslikerain3007.html" target="_blank">It Feels Like Rain</a>" from Aaron Neville's 1991 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Warm-Your-Heart-Aaron-Neville/dp/B000002GJK" target="_blank">Warm Your Heart</a>".
