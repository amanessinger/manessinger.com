In the morning, after having written yesterday's entry, I had no time to take images, and in fact I arrived at work literally at the last minute.<br/><br/>I had already decided to skip image taking for today, when on my way to the train I looked through this fence.<br/><br/>Vienna's southern railway station is one big construction site for the next years. You have already seen some images from there, and today, looking through this fence, I saw the signs reading "VIENNA SIGHTSEEING". <br/><br/>Is that bizarre? In all this disorder, in all this chaos, in the middle of a place that's as unattractive for tourists as it can get, there is a lost piece of touristic infrastructure. And in front of that ... flowers. Well ... that's pretty, I thought.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080517_170154_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080517_170154_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> There was not much processing needed for the Image of the Day. It was the first thing that I did on the train, and then I began to process more SoFoBoMo images. I managed to do five of them while on the train, and this brings the score up to 22. On the other hand, it's a week now since I shot them, and there is only one more week to go. Still no idea how to make a book.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/beautiful-south-pretty-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Pretty</a>" from the 2003 Beautiful South album "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gaze-Beautiful-South/dp/B0000DBPHO" target="_blank">Gaze</a>".
