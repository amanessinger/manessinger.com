I went to a local park and tried to realize a concept that had been in my head for some time: Wide angle landscape images with tarot cards in them. The idea was to bring in a surreal element via the juxtaposition of reality and the symbols of the Major Arcana.<br/><br/>I failed miserably. I cannot remember a session that produced so much unusable rubbish in years. This image, although sub-par, is the only that I could even think of using. Well, let's forget about it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/ten-years-after-i-may-be-wrong-but-i-won-t-be-wrong-always-lyrics.html" target="_blank">I May Be Wrong, But I Won't Be Wrong Always</a>" from the 1968 Ten Years After release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Undead-Ten-Years-After/dp/B0000636NQ" target="_blank">Undead</a>".
