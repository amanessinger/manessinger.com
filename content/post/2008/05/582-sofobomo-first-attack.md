I had tried to realize concept #3, a real trip along a route, and I did it in a gorge in the southern mountains of Carinthia, the so called "<a href="http://www.showcaves.com/english/at/gorges/Tscheppa.html" target="_blank">Tscheppaschlucht</a>".<br/><br/>The idea was, to simply follow the trail along the creek. I ended up with a five hour walk and 140 images taken. Enough for a book? Probably, but I will return anyway. Almost all images were shot with the Sigma 10-20, mostly at or around 10mm. In hindsight I'd like to have more with other lenses. You know, any lens brings with it a certain way of seeing, and I'd like to explore some different angles before I call it a book.<br/><br/>Processing will be done in Lab mode, using a "Man from Mars" for color correction. The images were originally shot at "Cloudy" white balance. I did not trust the automatics with all that yellow/green foliage. Conversion in Camera RAW was done to 5000 Kelvin / +10. That's a nice base for the Lab manipulations afterwards. Overall I try to keep processing conservative. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/proclaimers/the+first+attack_20111498.html" target="_blank">The First Attack</a>" from the 1987 Proclaimers album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-Story-Proclaimers/dp/B000006N5M" target="_blank">This Is the Story</a>". No sound samples but what Amazon has. Sorry.
