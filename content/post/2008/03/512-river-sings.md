A year??), I needed to resort to my TODO images.<br/><br/>This one is from my trip to Firenze, Italy, where I met <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/11/finally-florence-manessinger-challenge.html" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a>. I took it the morning we were shooting the sunrise at Il Duomo. This is river Arno, and although I had the image on my TODO list, I didn't need to do anything at all.<br/><br/>Nikon D200, Nikon 18-200 VR at 200mm, f8 and 1/80s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/enya/the_river_sings.html" target="_blank">The River Sings</a>" from Enya's gorgeous 2005 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amarantine-Enya/dp/B000B8QEYC" target="_blank">Amarantine</a>".
