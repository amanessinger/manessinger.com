I shot it in the morning, just before I entered this building. I took a series of about 10 shots, some focused on the building, some on the reflections. It's amazing: you could do that the whole day and the images would all be slightly different.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/rolling-stones-the-in-another-land-lyrics.html" target="_blank">In Another Land</a>" from the 1967 Rolling Stones album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Majesties-Request-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006AW2M" target="_blank">Their Satanic Majesties Request</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6x8_WWZefw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
