This is Friday's image, shot in the morning on my way to work. I had the Sigma 20/1.8 mounted from the day before, when I saw this hard working bicycle leaning there, having a well-earned rest.<br/><br/>Searching for a Song of the Day, the word "lean" brought me to "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/housemartins-lean-on-me-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Lean On Me</a>" from the 1986 stellar Housemartins debut "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/London-0-Hull-4-Housemartins/dp/B000002H3Z" target="_blank">London 0 Hull 4</a>". Looking for a video on YouTube, I found "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciqZ9Rj41hI" target="_blank">Beautiful South - Good As Gold & Lean On Me</a>", and I thought, "Oh sure, when the Housemartins broke up, Paul Heaton founded The Beautiful South. Makes sense", but this was only a lucky accident. After hearing through the first part of the video, a fantastic "Good As Gold", I found out that Paul had chrned out another "Lean On Me". Damn, one more CD to buy!
