Thursday was a day of plenty, and that's one reason why it took me so long to come up with this entry.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080320_083200_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080320_083200_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> In the morning it began completely innocent, with a little sunshine, too cold for the season but friendly. I tried to get on with my series of images with de-focused foregrounds of color. After Wednesday's pink and green I wanted to tackle blue, a much bigger challenge. <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080320_083221_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080320_083221_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I had already tried it the last two days, had tried cars and traffic signs, but whenever there was something blue, the background did not work. That's not always a problem in photography, but with these shots it is: after all, you have to focus on the background.<br/><br/>This magnolia tree is very near to where I work. It stands in front of a baroque palace, and I have made these two shots from the other side of the street, the front lens more or less inside some flowers. It's the same tree, and if you look very carefully, you can see that I have removed a branch from the yellow image, that I have left in in the blue. In the blue image it works, because the movement is mostly horizontal, but in the yellow image with the strong diagonal composition it was out of place.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080320_160937.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080320_160937.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Fast forward in time. I left work at 4pm, and that's how Vienna looked like. Sort of a backlash. I'm afraid there will be more of that the next days. In fact, the very moment that I write this, Saturday noon, it has just stopped snowing.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080320_162246_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080320_162246_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The next image again reminds me of those environments that you see in sci-fi computer games, the techno-industrial environments that you run around and where you frag your enemies.<br/><br/>This is the same escalator that we had in "<a href="/2008/02/475-up-with-people.html" target="_blank">475 - Up with People</a>", but this time I ran to be first, in order to get it devoid of people. There is nothing wrong with people, but in this case, using the Nikon 18-200 VR at 18mm, I wanted the neutrality that allows me to think of this place as a sci-fi environment.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080320_172431_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080320_172431_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> What can you do on a winter day in early spring? What about swimming? Actually that's what I did, and this time I took a borrowed Fuji FinePix F11 with me, along with an underwater bag. The F11 is a six megapixel camera with Fuji's SuperCCD sensor, and it makes quite good images, obviously copes well with strong contrasts, has moderate noise levels at ISO 200 and delivers usable results up to ISO 800.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080320_173038_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080320_173038_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I took about 80 images while fogs rose from the warm water, snowflakes drifted, and for a short moment it looked like the sun would brake through the clouds.<br/><br/>In the end it decided to stay veiled, and shortly after these images were taken, snowfall returned with might. Well, there are worse things than to float in the warm water and let the snow fall on your face ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/beatles-for-you-blue-lyrics.html" target="_blank">For You Blue</a>" from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-Be-Beatles/dp/B000002UB6" target="_blank">Let It Be</a>", the last album published by the Beatles.
