Wednesday morning, on my way to work, I shot these two images, both using the Nikon 18-200 VR at 200mm.<br/><br/>Green is an easy color, at least at this time of the year. It sprouts everywhere and nothing is simpler than to hide in a bush and take your images from within, keeping the de-focused leaves as colorful foreground.<br/><br/>Having the choice between green and pink, I chose pink for ... the form of a hat? Fact is, I can't justify this image with rules. I can't and won't justify it at all, but I know that it has a certain quality, and I won't even deny that my grandmother wore hats like this and that there may be a connection.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080319_083618_ps_new.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080319_083618_ps_new.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Edit: as suggested by <a href="http://radiantvista.com/community/showthread.php?t=7454" target="_blank">feedback</a> on the Radiant Vista forums, I have made a variant of this image that eliminates the orange wall in the upper left. Much more harmony, for sure.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/xtc-pink-thing-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Pink Thing</a>" from the classic 1989 XTC album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oranges-Lemons-XTC/dp/B00005ATHN" target="_blank">Oranges &amp; Lemons</a>".
