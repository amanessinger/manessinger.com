They change colors, and it is really awkward to restore them after the fact. I wonder how people did this in film days.<br/><br/>Anyway. Today we made a trip down to Slovenia. The idea was to visit a lake that regularly vanishes in summer, but it's on 800 meters above sea level, and when we were there, we found the landscape covered with snow. We chose plan B and escaped to the sea, entering Italy in Trieste.<br/><br/>It was an uncommonly clear day in Italy, and I can't remember ever having seen the mountains of South Tyrol from Trieste. Amazing.<br/><br/>These two images were taken just south of Udine using the Nikon 18-200 VR.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Barbra_Streisand:On_A_Clear_Day" target="_blank">On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)</a>" from the 1970 Barbra Streisand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clear-Day-You-Can-Forever/dp/B0006VXMLM" target="_blank">movie</a>.
