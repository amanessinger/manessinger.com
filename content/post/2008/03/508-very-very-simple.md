Two images that have nothing in common but their similarity. Two images of today, one of lush beauty, one of striking banality. What's your choice?<br/><br/>The flowers were shot through the window of a flower shop. Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, 1/100s and ISO 800. The same lens was use in the Image of the Day, f2.8, 1/125s and ISO 200.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Very Very Simple" from the 1984 Carla Bley album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Hate-Sing-Carla-Bley/dp/B0000031NV" target="_blank">I Hate to Sing</a>". Hear a very minimalistic live version performed by Carla and Steve on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAGyg5KTpLU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. <br/><br/>When you look at the reviews on Amazon, you see that few people seem to like this album. I have no idea why ðŸ™‚
