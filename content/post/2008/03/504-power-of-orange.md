That you can make it! <br/><br/>We had rain in Vienna and I had no time to even think about taking images until late tonight in Carinthia. <br/><br/>On the train I had tried to catch up a little with Craig Tanner's <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/critique" target="_blank">Daily Critiques</a>, and one of them was about his <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/workshops" target="_blank">Next Step</a> workshops in Savannah, and how they have an assignment of taking a randomly chosen object and using it in a series of images.<br/><br/>As I had absolutely nothing for today, I thought it would be a good idea to try the game, and my object was one of the Coca Cola glasses that were recently given with every McDonald's menu. I used the Sigma 70/2.8, a tripod, two LED lamps and different vividly colored objects that I positioned behind the glass. The glass itself is greenish, the object in this case was red, the LED lights give very cold, bluish light. <br/><br/>Here I have only intensified but not essentially changed colors. Not always am I that innocent though. Frequently I completely re-design the color-scape of a scene, most of the time favoring opposites and trying to bring out variations. By the way, this is one of the things that I have learned from Craig Tanner. Many of his Daily Critiques are about color. It's unlikely that you read my blog and never have seen Craig's critiques, but should that be the case, head over to <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/" target="_blank">The Radiant Vista</a>, otherwise you miss out big time.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tori-amos-the-power-of-orange-knickers-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Power Of Orange Knickers</a>" from Tori Amos' 2005 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beekeeper-Tori-Amos/dp/B00076EPQM" target="_blank">The Beekeeper</a>".
