In the morning I left home under blue sky and sunshine, ready to shoot the marvels that would unfold on my way to work, but after only 500 meters I had to bury my plans in falling snow. Slightly fed up I took the tram.<br/><br/>Most of the day was sunny while I was at work, and sure enough the sun vanished as soon as I went home. Oh well! <br/><br/>This image was taken through a forsythia shrub. This is basically the same technique of conjuring up color as yesterday, and if the weather stays the same, you may get more of that. I'm sure I can get some nice green, but blue will probably be a challenge ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The image is dedicated to the victims of suppression in Tibet, and the Song of the Day is "Wartime Prayer" from Clarence Bucaro's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sense-Light-Clarence-Bucaro/dp/B0001XAPO2" target="_blank">Sense of Light</a>". No lyrics, no video.
