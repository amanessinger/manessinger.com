For the Image of the Day I have used my new flash, flashing directly into the snowflakes, freezing them at 1/250s. In the meantime (it's past Sunday noon now) the snow has melted again, although there is more of it predicted for tomorrow.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/elvis-costello-black-and-white-world-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Black And White World</a>" from the 1980 collection of b-sides and album cuts "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Marys-Hows-Your-Fathers/dp/B000006XTF" target="_blank">Ten Bloody Marys &amp; Ten How's Your Fathers</a>" by Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions.
