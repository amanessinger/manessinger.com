Mine at least has its own ways. Today I set out to create another one of these images with unfocused swatches of color in the foreground, and while I drove, I realized that I was mentally closed. I looked for flowers and blossoms, nothing else, and although I know that this normally produces the desired results, it does not feel half as good as simply letting go, opening myself up <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080330_170729_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080330_170729_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> to the world around me, dialing the ego to a lower level, stopping to think about my environment, letting it run through me, tasting the wind, drinking the sun, touching the light, getting entangled in lines and embraced by colors.<br/><br/>No, I'm not drunk and it's not always so dramatic, but basically that is the nature of my inspiration, and when I give in, I have no idea what to expect. In this state of mind images just happen, because I am at a higher level of sensitivity to what is around me. I react to the smallest impulse, and I react immediately. Being alone helps greatly ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the hilarious rendering of "My Way" by the Austrian brass septet Mnozil Brass from "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Smoke-Live-Mnozil-Brass/dp/B00006C73P" target="_blank">Smoke Live</a>". There are some clips on YouTube, unfortunately not this one, but to get a feeling for what this band is about, you could see their version of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBLm747tyn0" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>".
