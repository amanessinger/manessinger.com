The Image of the Day was shot at the same place as "<a href="/2008/02/489-electric-ladyland-iii.html" target="_blank">489 - Electric Ladyland III</a>", only some meters to the left and with a different lens. The landscape is completely dominated by masts and cables, dissonant as the rough, noisy finish that I have chosen. In contrast to this we have the undulating, horizontal lines of the other image, bucolic, soft, finished with a soft blur on top.<br/><br/>It would be about time to answer to Ted Byrne's recent essay "<a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2008/03/wow.html" target="_blank">What Do We Do After We Go ‚ÄúWow‚Äù? The purpose of beauty in art photography</a>", and these two images could be an anchor, but it's too late now. I'll try it tomorrow üôÇ<br/><br/>In case you have not guessed it: The Song of the Day is still "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/jimi-hendrix-have-you-ever-been-to-electric-ladyland-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Have You Ever Been (to Electric Ladyland)</a>" from Jimi Hendrix' 1968 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Ladyland-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience/dp/B000002P5U" target="_blank">Electric Ladyland</a>".
