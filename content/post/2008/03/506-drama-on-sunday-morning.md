Light can't get any more "magic".<br/><br/>Exactly that happened this morning. I woke up, opened my eyes, and what I saw through the window was just what you see in the Image of the Day. Knowing that I had minutes at most, I jumped out of bed, grabbed the camera, quickly changed the Sigma 70/2.8 for the Nikon 18-200 VR, and ran out into the garden. And really, less than 5 minutes later all was gone. The rising sun hit the clouds and the golden light vanished altogether.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080302_075155_nx_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080302_075155_nx_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> 40 minutes later the sun broke free once more, and from then on it shone all day. The Image of the Day was shot at 26mm, f9, 1/100s and ISO 320 (in the hurry I had forgotten to set minimum shutter speed down to something more reasonable with this lens), and this second image with 18mm, f9, 1/400s and ISO 200.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/velvet-underground-and-nico-sunday-morning-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Sunday Morning</a>" from the Velvet Underground's 1967 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Velvet-Underground-Nico/dp/B000002G7C" target="_blank">The Velvet Underground & Nico</a>".
