What have you discovered about patterns?" did Ted ask in a comment to my <a href="/2008/02/500-half-of-it-dearie.html" target="_blank">#500</a>.  That they are powerful and everywhere? That they are fragile? That you have to help them along sometime? That rust comes in many colors and so does iron?<br/><br/>I shot this image yesterday morning on my way to work, using the Sigma 70/2.8 (no this lens still does not bore me) at f9, 1/100s and ISO 500. Today, on the train from Vienna to Carinthia, I began working on it, had it already finished, after some sleep came back to it, and now it is finally what I want it to be.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/a/anyoldiron.shtml" target="_blank">Any Old Iron</a>" by the great Peter Sellers. I have it on the 1990 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Sellers-Collection/dp/B00004SEBF" target="_blank">The Peter Sellers Collection</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqfemDDz3qs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
