Yesterday morning when I went to work, I saw this bicycle, leaning against the post of a traffic sign, saw the other sign in the back, saw that those three objects, two of which we normally would assume to be properly vertical, were leaning in quite some angle to each other and to the buildings ... and I knew, I had to take an image. Not only that: I knew that it had to be a vertical, that it had to be placed along the diagonal, and that it would not do to go near and use a wide angle lens. I had to be quite a way away and I had to use 200mm, the longest focal length that I have available. Inspiration? Experience? Style?<br/><br/>Everybody would take this image in a different way, almost nobody would take it at all ... Inspiration is a strange thing.<br/><br/>The other image, the funny guy, is from another bicycle, one sign post further down. Both were shot with the Nikon 18-200 VR.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-we-re-all-mad-here-lyrics.html" target="_blank">We're All Mad Here</a>" from Tom Waits' album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alice-Tom-Waits/dp/B00005YX3L" target="_blank">Alice</a>".
