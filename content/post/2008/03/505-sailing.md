Yesterday was a drab, rainy day here in Carinthia, and the northern part of Austria had a bad storm that is supposed to return today. Not a tornado or hurricane, but with speeds up to 100 mph nevertheless. Four people in Austria were reported dead, three of them hit by falling trees. I decided to stay in bed and slept for most of the day.<br/><br/>At night I tried to take some images of forks. Why forks? Well, Neil Creek, one of my co-artists on <a href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/" target="_blank">Fine Art Photoblog</a>, runs a <a href="http://neil.creek.name/blog/2008/03/02/project-iron-chef-photography-fork/" target="_blank">competition</a> about images of forks on his blog, basically a creativity training, and, having no image yet, I thought I could at least try. <br/><br/>Shiny little bastards, those forks. I found myself without easy success, completely uninspired and at the moment not willing to further explore the essence forks. I gave up and decided to tackle one of those images tagged "TODO" in my image database.<br/><br/>This is it. An image shot last July in the harbor of Mali Lo≈°inj, an image that I did not use as Image of the Day then, an image that I always planned to work upon one time and that I had completely forgotten in the meantime.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/rod-stewart-sailing-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Sailing</a>" by Rod Stewart, and I have it on the 1982 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Absolutely-Live-Rod-Stewart/dp/B000002KYH" target="_blank">Absolutely Live</a>".
