And then, in the evening it began to ... snow? Not exactly what I call an easter weekend ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>In the evening, when I really should have been desperate for an image, this one just happened. I went up the stairs to the first floor, when I saw the light glowing through the window of glass bricks, painting a pattern of light and shadow on the landing. This is a 10s exposure from the tripod. Nikon 18-200 VR at 44mm and f8.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/melissaetheridge/meetmeinthedark.html" target="_blank">Meet Me In The Dark</a>" is maybe the most beautiful song on Melissa Etheridge's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Melissa-Etheridge/dp/B0000V19LS" target="_blank">Lucky</a>". It's unbelievable that until two years ago this wonderful singer has completely escaped my radar. Well, not so any more.
