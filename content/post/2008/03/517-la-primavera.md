The sun was shining brightly, I hoped to catch some rays in the park, surely I did, and it did not last long. I used two lenses, the Sigma 20/1.8 which is gorgeous, did not do it today but will return soon, and of course the Sigma 70/2.8 Macro. <br/><br/>It's funny. When I bought the 70/2.8, I was not sure if I would really use it that much. After all, macro photography is not so much my thing, I have the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro as well, and for general photography, there should be not so much of a difference between it and the Nikon 50/1.8, right?<br/><br/>Wrong. This turned out to be my most used lens of the last three months. For this particular image I used the mat that I always carry around, laid on the ground and shot with f2.8 and 1/500s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day could easily be the opening Allegro of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons", but we're going for the exotic today: "<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Mariza/Primavera.html" target="_blank">Primavera</a>" by Portuguese fado superstar Mariza.
