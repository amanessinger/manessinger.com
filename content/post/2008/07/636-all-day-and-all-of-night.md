Turns out it did, at least for me, although everyone on SmugMug seems to ignore it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>"Einfahrt Tag u. Nacht freihalten!" is German and means "Keep entrance clear all day and all of the night", thus "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/k/kinks/all+day+all+of+the+night_20078972.html" target="_blank">All Day and All of the Night</a>", the 1964 second hit single by The Kinks is the Song of the Day. The recent "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kinks-Ultimate-Collection/dp/B00005V4WI" target="_blank">Ultimate Collection</a>" is a very good compilation that I can recommend. Hear the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMWNwHof0kc" target="_blank">single version</a> and a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4DV-5d6a5g" target="_blank">live version</a> on YouTube.
