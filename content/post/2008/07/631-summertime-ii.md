I love this season, and yesterday, while on my way to the lake, I tried to find out what exactly characterizes our landscape these days.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080705_160136_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080705_160136_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The three images of yesterday represent such a thing: harvested fields baking in the hot sun. They were taken at the same time in the same place, but looking in slightly different directions. As a result, neither the contrast between sky and earth was the same nor the colors. And that's one of the things that I have learned while working on my <a href="/search/label/SoFoBoMo" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a> <a href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/tscheppaschlucht?mode=embed&documentId=080615094752-71bb975bcb574a92a12e8b84cc696d08&layout=grey" target="_blank">book</a>: A series of images from a certain time and a certain place just does not make it, unless you take your time to match colors and light. It's a well known phenomenon, that strongly contrasting images easily make a good match, whereas largely similar but in subtle ways different images fight each other.<br/><br/>So, "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/george-gershwin-summertime-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Summertime</a>" is the Song of the Day, but what version? Yesteryear we had Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross, this year it's Helen Merrill. I have two different recordings of this Gershwin tune by Helen Merrill, one of them, the one that I like better, on a compilation called "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blossom-Stars-Helen-Merrill/dp/B000025BGT" target="_blank">Blossom of Stars</a>", that currently only seems available used and from &pound;45 upwards. Ouch! I suggest that, before shell out the money, you sample the wares <a href="http://singinandswingin.blogspot.com/2007/12/helen-merrill-blossom-of-stars-1993.html" target="_blank">around here</a>.
