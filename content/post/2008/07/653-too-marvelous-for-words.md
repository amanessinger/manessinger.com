It's interesting, in different languages some things have completely different names, just as if these languages did not have common roots. Butterflies are one of them.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080727_174743_nx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080727_174743_nx.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The Nikon 85/1.8 is not exactly a macro lens and these images are cropped, but at least it is sharp and focuses precisely. I saw the two butterflies this afternoon in a forest, on my way to the lake. It took me 40 images and some patience to come up with these. <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the Johnny Mercer standard "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/e/ellafitzgerald1351/toomarvelousforwords267009.html" target="_blank">Too Marvelous for Words</a>", this time sung, yes, sung indeed, by Oscar Peterson on his 1952 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Romance-Vocal-Styling-Oscar-Peterson/dp/B0000565Z8" target="_blank">Romance (The Vocal Styling of Oscar Peterson)</a>". Very recommendable, sometimes hard to get, at the moment a tad expensive, even if you get it used. Of course there's no video of Oscar singing, but I can recommend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6c6YzwiMts" target="_blank">Ella</a> instead ðŸ™‚
