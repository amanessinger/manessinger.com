Remember that I told you about it in "<a href="/2008/07/638-in-grove.html" target="_blank">638 - In The Grove"</a>"? When I went to work yesterday morning, I was constantly on the lookout for vertical compositions that had elements of those dream images.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080715_080103.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080715_080103.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Of course I did not find anything that even remotely matched what I had seen, but given that I was in Vienna's streets, it did not come unexpectedly that there were neither flower-strewn beds nor sailing boats around. That was not what I was looking for anyway. I was looking for structural similarities, and what I found was vague at best.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080715_080926.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080715_080926.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Here are five vertical images that have been shot with the dream images in mind, plus a fancy car and another vertical that I could not resist to take when the sun went down. I present these images in unedited form, and I do that for two reasons: firstly, I was too lazy to edit seven files, and secondly, this is not about any single image, this is about a series, inspired by a dream.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080715_081247.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080715_081247.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The images are mostly in the order they were taken. What I was after, was roughly a pattern of vertical stripes in the background, and a foreground that covers the lower third of the image, but in an asymmetrical way. The Image of the Day was my first attempt. Compared to the dream of the bed and the window, the relation between foreground and background is inverse: here the background is sharp, my hand, used as an impromptu foreground is out of focus.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080715_081042.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080715_081042.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> This does not matter for my purpose, but I believe that one of the two should be out of focus. All images were taken with the Sigma 70/2.8, mostly wide open, to provide for a shallow depth of field.<br/><br/>While working, I found this base concept inspiring, although I did not stick strictly to it. Most images keep only the verticals, and the foreground is replaced by part of the sidewalk, asymmetry provided by the perspective.<br/><br/>What's the point of all that? For me it was interesting to see these dream images at all, and trying to respond to them was only natural. Why do I share it? Sure, this is as "work in progress" as it could possibly be, but in a way I think this is interesting. It's more or less a kind of unfiltered visual thought.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080715_163445.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080715_163445.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Now for something completely different. I often photograph and write about bicycles, and many of them are products of the former Austrian company "Puch". I had almost forgotten that they had also made cars, but when I saw one on the streets, I simply had to take an image. This is a "Puch 500", basically a licensed "Fiat 500". I have never sat in such a car, much less driven one myself. They were almost extinct before my time.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080715_202923.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080715_202923.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The day ended with wonderful late sunlight, and I had to record this as well. This is the view through my living room window in Vienna.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/series.html" target="_blank">Series of Dreams</a>", is the last song on the 1991  official "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bootleg-1-3-Rare-Unreleased-1961/dp/B000MGOW42" target="_blank">Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3</a>". The song is from a collaboration with Daniel Lanois and U2, as far as I remember. See the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcMzqbiycVQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
