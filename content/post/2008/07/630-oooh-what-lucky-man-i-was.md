I was short on time in the morning, and when I left for the train, the light was utterly flat and uninspiring. I could have delayed photographing to the evening, but on the other hand I had plenty of time for post-processing while on the train.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070814_173210_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20070814_173210_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I always carry a bunch of files with me in a folder "TODO", and for lack of anything better to do, I began processing some of them.<br/><br/>The decaying house front is not far from where I live. When I am late and take the way to work via the Underground, I always pass by, but this particular image was taken about a year ago, in the afternoon. I used my Nikon 50/1.2 and was on the way to a concert where I wanted to use this fast lens.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070712_075001_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20070712_075001_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The next image, a garbage can in Mariahilfer StraÃŸe in Vienna, was taken last August with the then new Sigma 20/1.8. It was early morning on a bright day with blinding sunlight, and I liked the contrast between the modern design and the traces of ... uhmm ... neglect.<br/><br/>The final image, the Image of the Day, is from that Sunday morning in Florence/Italy when I was photographing with my friend <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/11/florence-5-andreas-and-duomo.html" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a>. This image was taken while Ted was on the other side, making the <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/10/this-place-looks-like-this.html" target="_blank">first image</a> that he posted from Florence.<br/><br/>This is one of those images that I always wanted to process. I tried it one time and did not particularly like the result, so it went back into the "TODO" folder. Much to Ted's annoyance I took all my images that morning from the tripod and I really took my time. Just as I was satisfied with the framing, a white car drove by to park in front of these poles, right in my image. I pressed the shutter only a second before. The sidelight is from the car's head lights. While the original would have been nothing but a failed attempt, this side light makes the image, and that's also what was so hard to bring out in post-processing. I was just a lucky man ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/emerson-lake-palmer-lucky-man-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Lucky Man</a>" from ELP's 1970 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emerson-Lake-Palmer/dp/B000NVL9FQ" target="_blank">Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer</a>".
