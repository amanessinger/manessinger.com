My first choice, a nice sunrise, perfectly matching the <a href="http://photomusings.wordpress.com/2008/07/06/cliche/" target="_blank">cliché</a>, had some technical flaws and, honestly, at this time of the day I don't have the nerve to do it again. It's always nice to have a backup ready, isn't it?<br/><br/>Well, the backup is another image of this morning, and it perfectly connects to yesterday's entry. This one was shot with the Nikon 50/1.2 at f1.2. It is a detail from a shop facade in Vienna's Josefstädter Straße, but with so extremely shallow depth of field, that it has become a complete abstract. This lens may be a beast to focus, but it sure was worth its money.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080708_072313_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080708_072313_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The second image is not a very elegant match, in fact the only two things that these two images have in common, are the street where they were taken and the lens that I have used. This second image was taken at f4, and somehow I like the asymmetric composition.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is another one by Natalie Cole, and that's by chance as well. It's "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/natalie-cole-with-my-eyes-wide-open-i-m-dreaming-lyrics.html" target="_blank">With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming</a>" from the 1999 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snowfall-Sahara-Natalie-Cole/dp/B00000JC68" target="_blank">Snowfall on the Sahara</a>". The version that I have found on YouTube is not from Natalie but from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_P3SjYq_LQ" target="_blank">Patti Page</a>.
