It's not a normal ball though. It has a compartment that you can fill with cat-cookies, and when he rolls the ball, cookies fall out. You can imagine that he was busy playing and all the while kept us busy laughing. This is the best image of the series, as most of the time lately shot with the Sigma 70/2.8.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858484980" target="_blank">Ball and Biscuit</a>" from the 2003 White Stripes album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elephant-White-Stripes/dp/B00008J4P5" target="_blank">Elephant</a>".
