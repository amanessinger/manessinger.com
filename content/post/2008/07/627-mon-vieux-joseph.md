I took the train down on Monday afternoon, and today, Wednesday, I returned to Vienna early in the morning.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080701_163827_nx_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080701_163827_nx_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Of course I was swimming, albeit much too short. On my way to the lake, I took the first image, two blades of spelt (as I found out on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelt" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>), using the somewhat inelegant but extremely effective "machine gun" approach. Of the 11 surviving images, this was the one that I liked most. Talk about industrial image making ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Technically I have converted the image in Capture NX, because I liked the original approach of the camera and would have had a hard time to mimic colors and contrast in Adobe Camera RAW. The only thing that I did in CS3 was sharpening.<br/> <br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080701_212222_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080701_212222_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The other two images are from the break between the two parts of the concert. The <a href="http://www.clemencic.at/en/index_en.html" target="_blank">Clemencic Consort</a> gave Carmina Burana, and it was just as great as I had expected. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIfMyNglVYo" target="_blank">this video</a> for a sample. In the Gothic church of Maria Saal we had the slightly nicer environment though ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I am quite sure that the Saint on the glass window holding the infant Christ is Joseph, thus the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/georges_moustaki/joseph.html" target="_blank">Joseph</a>" from Georges Moustaki's best known 1969 (what a year!!!) album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Meteque-Georges-Moustaki/dp/B000006RJ0" target="_blank">Le Meteque</a>".
