It's an image that I took Sunday night when I arrived in Vienna. I think there is nothing particularly wrong with this image, in fact I liked it enough to make it Image of the Day, but of the images of the last days it is certainly not a favorite of mine. I see it as a filler, and it's success is probably a sign of a certain randomness. Some images get picked up by the crowd, some don't. Actually, the longer I think about this image, the more I feel the urge to crop from the right ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsdepot.com/patti-smith/midnight-rider.html" target="_blank">Midnight Riders</a>" from the 2007 Patti Smith album of cover versions "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Patti-Smith/dp/B000NDEXIE" target="_blank">Twelve</a>". You may like her version or not, but if not, there is always the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EkJRy3gIS4&feature=related" target="_blank">original</a> by the Allman Brothers Band.
