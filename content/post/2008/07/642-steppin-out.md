It was a hot, sunny afternoon and I went along a big street near work. The dream images of Tuesday morning still linger with me, and although I don't try to force anything, I still do mostly verticals. <br/><br/>There are new convex metal devices mounted on the lamp posts along many of Vienna's streets. They hold advertising posters for cultural events, and I have used one of these things like a wall. The reflection from the white building on the left provides a nice light source. I've used the Sigma 70/2.8 at f8 and 1/800s. Boy, speak of enough light! I am so near to the focus point, that even at f8 there is enough blur on the background to achieve the effect that I wanted.<br/><br/>I have pondered about the title for a long time, and I finally found what it reminds me of: it is like stepping out of a building into a sunny, to some degree uncertain future, but still certain enough to follow your way with confidence. It's an optimistic image ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Steppin' Out". I have it on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bluesbreakers-Clapton-Mayall-Blues-Breakers/dp/B00005K9QP" target="_blank">John Mayall - Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton</a>".
