No, no new image at the moment. SmugMug, my image hoster suffers from an outage of Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), <span style="font-weight: bold;">their</span> storage hoster. S3 has been dead for at least three hours now, and it looks like it will take them at least another hour. Oh bummer!
