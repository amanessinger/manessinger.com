My first idea was to take public transport, but I finally resisted the temptation. I mounted the Sigma 30/1.4, took the umbrella out of my Lowepro Rover AW II backpack, secured its rain cover (AW means "all weather"), and off I went. Mostly caring about the camera, I was slightly wet upon arriving  home, but I had quite some nice images. What finally made it is this one, a Harley parked in the rain.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/roxette-harleys-indians-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Harleys & Indians (Riders In The Sky)</a>" from the 1994 Roxette album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crash-Boom-Bang-Roxette/dp/B000002TPD" target="_blank">Crash! Boom! Bang!</a>". Sorry, no video, but <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Roxette/_/Harleys%2B%2526%2BIndians%2B%2528Riders%2Bin%2Bthe%2BSky%2529" target="_blank">last.fm</a> has a sound sample.
