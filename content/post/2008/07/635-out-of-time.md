Malls, some central streets, they collect all the traffic, and many of the small shops near our living quarters had to close. This is in a way regrettable, but if everybody who regrets it now, had gone out in the past to actually shop there, they wouldn't have had to close in the first place. That's how we feel: we cherish the sentiment for a past that we would not want to live in.<br/><br/>"Uhren" is German and means "clocks" as well as "watches". The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.songfacts.com/lyrics.php?findsong=468" target="_blank">Out Of Time</a>" from the 1966 Rolling Stones album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aftermath-UK-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006EXCC" target="_blank">Aftermath</a>". I've linked to the UK version of the album, because that's what I own. Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RJfCOD_mXE&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
