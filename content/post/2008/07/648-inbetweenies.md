That feeling when it is time for a new toy? Yesterday I have hinted at something and today's image was made with a new Sigma 28/1.8. You know my images made with its wider sibling, the <a href="/search/label/Sigma%2020%2F1.8" target="_blank">20/1.8</a>, and this one has the same amazing near-focusing capability.<br/><br/>Unfortunately not all was wine and roses. Wide open, at low light, I found it's contrast severely lacking. I mean, I expected it, but not to this extend. In this regard the 20/1.8 fares better. <br/><br/>I originally bought this lens as a wide-but-not-so-wide street lens with macro capabilities. Being able to focus near, is one of the two things that I miss with my Sigma 30/1.4. The other thing is bokeh. What the 30/1.4 does to off-center out-of-focus point lights, can be more than harsh. On the other hand, contrast of the <a href="/search/label/Sigma%2030%2F1.4" target="_blank">30/1.4</a> is fantastic, even wide open. I may come back to the idea and get the Nikon 35/2.0 at some later time. This time I have traded the Sigma 28/1.8 in for a completely different lens ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/ian-dury-inbetweenies-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Inbetweenies</a>" by Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads.
