This is the image for Monday, you see, instead of catching up, I managed to get even two days behind now ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Monday afternoon I left Vienna for a one-day intermezzo in Carinthia. We had concert tickets for Tuesday evening. On my way to the Underground, I regularly pass this building, Justizpalast. You've seen it in "<a href="/2007/03/141-memories-of-summer.html" target="_blank">141 - Memories of Summer</a>", in "<a href="/2007/09/336-split-decision-up-in-sky.html" target="_blank">336 - Split Decision / Up In The Sky</a>" and "<a href="/2007/03/154-triumph-of-parliamentarism.html" target="_blank">154 - The Triumph of Parliamentarism</a>" was taken from its roof terrace.<br/><br/>I had the Sigma 30/1.4 mounted, and when I saw the light/shadow pattern caused by the shadow of a flag falling on the wall, I decided to get very near and use extremely shallow DOF. Well, in fact f4.5 was what I ended up with, and even with that I was already at 1/4000s. In hindsight I like it better as it is anyway. Any shallower and the image would considerably loose depth.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/gottatravelon.html" target="_blank">Gotta Travel On</a>" from Bob Dylan's much despised 1979 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Portrait-Bob-Dylan/dp/B0000024W3" target="_blank">Self Portrait</a>". On youTube I have not found it by him, but as this is an old standard, there are other versions, for instance <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Bt4xdf6sQ&feature=related" target="_blank">this one</a>.
