Is an image shot at that time an image of Sunday or an image of Monday? In "<a href="/2008/07/639-midnight-riders.html">639 - Midnight Riders</a>" my answer was a resounding "Sunday, of course!", but today I feel "Monday, probably" would be an equally good answer. Am I opportunistic or what?<br/><br/>This image was taken only minutes after the one posted for Sunday. Actually I like it better, although the SmugMug crowd thinks otherwise.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/morenight.html" target="_blank">One More Night</a>" from the 1969 Bob Dylan album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nashville-Skyline-Bob-Dylan/dp/B00028HODG" target="_blank">Nashville Skyline</a>". I have no video by His Bobness, thus a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qxVzS6B1ww&feature=related" target="_blank">cover</a> will have to do.
