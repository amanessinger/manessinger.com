This time we are in Vienna, the image is from today (caught up!!) and again I don't fight the ever present cables, the wires that keep our civilization running, again I use them. Apart from that I may have added some slight enhancements in Photoshop as well. I can't help it, it just happens some times.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080703_082731_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080703_082731_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The second image is from the morning. That's what I originally wanted to present as Image of the Day, before things got out of control ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>As always in this series: The Song of the Day is still "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/jimi-hendrix-have-you-ever-been-to-electric-ladyland-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Have You Ever Been (to Electric Ladyland)</a>" from Jimi Hendrix' 1968 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electric-Ladyland-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience/dp/B000002P5U" target="_blank">Electric Ladyland</a>".
