I took some mediocre images in the morning, while it was still dry, and some more interesting in late afternoon in pouring rain. I don't have the time to process all of them, but this is one of my favorites. Again I use a more or less out of focus background and a sharp foreground, and this time it is a variation on the concept of "<a href="/2008/06/601-rainy-day-in-june.html" target="_blank">601 - Rainy Day in June</a>". The lens used is the Sigma 30/1.4, and it took me some attempts to find the ideal aperture of f4. Here we have just enough definition in the background to vaguely recognize people and umbrellas, and enough blur to keep the image timeless and general.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/brenda_lee/heres_that_rainy_day.html" target="_blank">Here's That Rainy Day</a>". I have it on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Voices-Singers-Unlimited/dp/B00000AFFQ" target="_blank">Magic Voices</a>", a seven CD collection of all records made by the Singers Unlimited.
