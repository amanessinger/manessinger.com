Amazon has recovered during the night and SmugMug is also up again. Sorry folks.<br/><br/>Last morning, when posting Friday's images, I'd almost posted these two as well. Uhmm ... being days behind obviously tends to weaken my memory ... or so ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080719_094922_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080719_094922_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Anyway. Here we are with something old reflected in something new. This image, taken late Saturday morning, just minutes after the Image of the Day, shows the building where I work. I chose a B&amp;W conversion with this bluish tint for increased drama. You may agree or not, <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">some</a> will certainly not. But for <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">those</a> I have the Image of the Day, a brightly colored triptych celebrating monetary opportunity and numeric decline ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.brucespringsteen.net/songs/ThePriceYouPay.html" target="_blank">The Price You Pay</a>" from the 1980 Bruce Springsteen double album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Bruce-Springsteen/dp/B0000025KI" target="_blank">The River</a>". There is no original on YouTube, but plenty of covers like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY7mjysspuo&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">this one</a>.
