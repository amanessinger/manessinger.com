Nikon 85/1.8 at f1.8, 1/100s and ISO 1250.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/r/rickieleejones3275/nighttrain155074.html" target="_blank">Night Train</a>" from Rickie Lee Jones' 1979 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rickie-Lee-Jones/dp/B000002KK2" target="_blank">debut album</a>. No video, sorry.
