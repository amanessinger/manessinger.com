They had a longer outage last night (my night that is) during which no images could be added to the site. <br/><br/>I took both of these images yesterday afternoon, on my way home through <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.206514,16.352527&spn=0.00567,0.013497&z=17" target="_blank">LerchenfelderstraÃŸe</a>, one at the corner Lange Gasse, one at the corner Kellermanngasse. The bicycle fastened to the railing was only a question of composition, the other one required some thought ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/velvet-underground-the-i-m-waiting-for-the-man-lyrics.html" target="_blank">I'm Waiting For The Man</a>" from the classic 1967 Velvet Underground "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Velvet-Underground-Nico/dp/B000002G7C" target="_blank">Banana</a>" album. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UpFGoJHwLI" target="_blank">this video</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugY9CwhfzE" target="_blank">that</a>. Why exactly this song? Honestly, I have no idea ðŸ™‚)
