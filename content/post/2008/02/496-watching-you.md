It is complex, or at least the distortions of the 1mm lens suggest complexity. For me this is a lurker's perspective. Someone is watching someone else, but why? Is there a story to be told?<br/><br/>Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, f4.5, ISO 1600 and 1/8s. Post-processing in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/melissaetheridge/watchingyou.html" target="_blank">Watching You</a>" from Melissa Etheridge's 1988 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Melissa-Etheridge/dp/B000001FSC" target="_blank">debut album</a>. As regards her music, I am a late-comer, but better late than never, right?
