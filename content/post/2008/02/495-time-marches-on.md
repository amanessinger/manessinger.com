Well, at least the images are done and already uploaded to SmugMug, the titles are found, the Songs selected, only the actual writing is left. Let's go:<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080220_085116_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080220_085116_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> These images are from Wednesday, and the first is a morning image. I took it near work, using the Sigma 70/2.8 at f13. Nothing spectacular, but I like the compression.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080220_180055_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080220_180055_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The next one is from the evening. Before leaving work, I had switched to the Sigma 10-20. 10mm and f4 at ISO 360 and 1/8s. We had images like that before, although that does not necessarily stop me doing variations again. Anyway, nothing really new here.<br/><br/>Most of the other images were shot from out of different doorways, with very slow shutter speeds, focused at one wall of the doorway. I had taken lots of these images. Some had people walking by, some not, and from those that had, I liked the one that became Image of the Day best.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once again from Dr. John, "<a href="http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/doctor_john/6634261/lyrics.jhtml" target="_blank">Time Marches On</a>", and again it is from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/NAwlinz-Dis-dUdda-Dr-John/dp/B0001XQ6FE" target="_blank">N'Awlinz: Dis Dat or d'Udda</a>".
