Yes, I had a lot of probably usable images on Thursday, but this is supposed to be a daily photoblog, right? I should have simply taken one of them and been done with it. No, instead I held up the queue, searching for the "best" image. Of course you don't know what's best, as long as you don't have post-processed all of them. Well, if I had continued to process all candidates, you'd still be waiting. This morning image, taken with the Nikon 18-200 VR at f13 and 1/50s was the first candidate. I already had taken some shots, when finally the fog rose from the valley. Moments later we were shrouded.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080207_165415_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080207_165415_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> This image and the Image of the Day were both taken at sundown on the mountain Dobratsch. I have been quite often up there last year, but this year it was the first time. I was really there for the eastern sundown, for the soft, gentle gradient, but how the sun vanished, that really had its charm ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Both images were taken with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and f11. I shot these images hand-held, later for some HDR images I changed to the tripod.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, as a memorial to my stupidity, is the Bruce Cockburn composition "<a href="http://cockburnproject.net/songs&amp;music/wfam.html" target="_blank">Waiting For A Miracle</a>", interpreted by the Jerry Garcia Band on their 1991 live album.
