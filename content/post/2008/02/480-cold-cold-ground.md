Low clouds hung between the mountains, the plain at the bottom of the valley lay silent and barren. Originally I had mounted the Sigma 150/2.8, but for this image I needed a wider frame. This is the Sigma 30/1.4 at f11 and 1/200s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-cold-cold-ground-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Cold Cold Ground</a>" from Tom Waits' legendary 1987 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franks-Wild-Years-Tom-Waits/dp/B000001FSR" target="_blank">Franks Wild Years</a>". A live version of the song is available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeQ_3oPidU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
