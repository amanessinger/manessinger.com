Both were shot with the Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, both were slightly worked upon, and in a way I see them as opposites. Do you agree? Not? Why??<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/x/xtc/frivolous+tonight_20147687.html" target="_blank">Frivolous Tonight</a>" from the 1999 XTC album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Venus-1-XTC/dp/B00000I4JT" target="_blank">Apple Venus Volume 1</a>".
