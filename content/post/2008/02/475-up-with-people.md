I'm always these days. Very exciting things are happening ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I shot this image yesterday in an underground station. Do you notice the camera? They're everywhere. Why? Because you're a suspect! Huh?? Oh, it's not personal, everybody is. It's just that you exist what makes them suspect you. See? Not exist - no problem.<br/><br/>If you happen to be Austrian, why not go over <a href="http://www.ueberwachungsstaat.at/" target="_blank">there</a> and do something about it?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lambchop.info/lyrics/nixonlyrics.html" target="_blank">Up with People</a>" from Lambchop's 2000 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nixon-Lambchop/dp/B00003XA9R" target="_blank">Nixon</a>".
