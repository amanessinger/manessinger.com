You see, I love this lens! It's not stabilized, but that's not really a problem with the D300. I use it with Auto-ISO set to 1/100s minimum shutter speed and a maximum ISO of 3200, and that almost always suffices.<br/><br/>In this case I have used f2.8, 1/500s and ISO 200. The result was a tad busy and not as balanced as I wanted it, thus I have invested quite a bit in post-processing.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.actionext.com/names_b/blood_sweat_and_tears_lyrics/sometimes_in_winter.html" target="_blank">Sometimes In Winter</a>" from the 1969 Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Tears/dp/B00004XSVH" target="_blank">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears</a>".
