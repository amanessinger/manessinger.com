Disharmony? Shooting landscapes in our modern times can be tough. Of course you can get out into the big national parks (Austria has quite some of them), and then you won't be bothered by power and telephone lines, but then, why be bothered at all? Are they not an integral part of our life? Don't we depend on them more than on anything else? Our heating system burns oil (hmm ... another such folly), but without electric power it would stop. It is controlled by a computer, it can be programmed to start and stop at certain times of day, to target certain temperatures, whatsoever, but take away these ugly power lines that we photographers hate so much ... and it stops.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080211_092810_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080211_092810_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> If it must be, here is a harmonious image as well. Both were shot with the Sigma 70/2.8 at f11, in both I have cloned out some minor distractions.  Disharmonious disharmony?
