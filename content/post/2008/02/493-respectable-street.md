This is the image of Monday, and I'm still two days behind. <br/><br/>Today's excuse? Well, I have published my three entries labeled "<a href="/search/label/Photoshop%20Tutorial" target="_blank">Photoshop Tutorial</a>" to <a href="http://www.good-tutorials.com/" target="_blank">good-tutorials</a>, and all three made it to the front page, netting me the biggest rush on my blog so far. <br/><br/>One of the readers asked me for a Photoshop file for the "<a href="/2008/01/448-down-in-hole.html" target="_blank">creating details</a>" tutorial, and then the problem began: I could easily crop the image to 200x200 pixels, enough to reveal the layer structure and still keep the file at only 1.2 MB (compared to the 330 MB of the original), but I found out that SmugMug would not host PSD files! Hmm ... that's unfortunate: you pay for a pro account with unlimited bandwidth, but they don't let you upload files of the world's most popular image manipulation program. The challenge was now, to find a free hoster with a high bandwidth limit. <br/><br/>After some research I settled with <a href="http://box.net/" target="_blank">box.net</a> and their free "lite" account. It's 10 GB per month limit will suffice for about 7000 downloads per month, and I hope that is enough. If not, I'll probably have to upgrade. We'll see.<br/><br/>This image was shot Monday evening on Vienna's most busy shopping street Mariahilfer Stra√üe, and I used the Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8 and 1/160s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is XTC's "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/xtc-respectable-street-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Respectable Street</a>".
