Bistra is located in a very rural environment along the marshes south-west of Slovenia's capital Ljubljana, only about 90 minutes by car from home. We had bad luck though, the museum is closed until March.<br/><br/>Being already there, we decided to drive a little further along the road towards <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=45.922976,14.362564&spn=0.382594,0.902252&z=11" target="_blank">Borovnica</a>, and from there a forest road up a mountain and to a church that we saw on the map.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080223_160745_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080223_160745_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> And I'm glad we did! In that forest I have seen more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helleborus_niger" target="_blank">Christmas Roses</a> than before in my whole life altogether (Hey Flo, I found out all by myself!). The mountain is sprinkled with flowers. The Image of the Day and this image  were both shot there, both with the Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8. It was an extremely warm weekend with temperatures up to 20 degrees Celsius, and for the Image of the Day I actually lay on the ground, wearing Jeans and T-Shirt.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080223_162225_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080223_162225_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> On top of the mountain there was actually a village and sure enough this church. Churches on Mountains and hills, that's a very common thing in Slovenia, and much more apparent than in every other European region that I've seen so far. This is the only image taken with the Nikon 18-200 VR at 18mm. The foreground tempted me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080223_164807_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080223_164807_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Borovnica is hardly more than a big village with some old industry. I don't know what they produce, but at least I took this image of some industrial architecture. It does not look totally deserted in Borovnica, but also not very lively either.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080223_171111_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080223_171111_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> We took our way back along a completely straight, narrow street through the marshes, parallel to the river Ljubljanica. Every once in a while a way goes right or left, many of them like this one with beautiful trees.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080223_172430_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080223_172430_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Shortly before you reach Ljubljana, the road leads through the long stretched village ?rna vas (Black Village, after the black earth in the marshes) with its famous church of <a href="http://www.slovenia.info/en/sakralne-znamenitosti/?rna-vas,-Church-of-St-Michael.htm?sakralne_znamenitosti=6309&lng=2" target="_blank">St. Michael</a>, built by the most important architect of Slovenia, JoÅ¾e Ple?nik. We were not inside because it was already late, but we will certainly come back.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080223_171241_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080223_171241_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> It was a warm day, but not clear at all. The air was full of haze, and this hazy sundown concludes our little trip to Slovenia.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/wherethewildrosesgrow.html" target="_blank">Where The Wild Roses Grow</a>" by Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue, from the 1996 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Murder-Ballads-Nick-Cave-Seeds/dp/B000002N5S" target="_blank">Murder Ballads</a>".
