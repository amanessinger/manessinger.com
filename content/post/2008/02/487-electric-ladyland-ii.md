Only one so far for today, I may add one or two later.<br/><br/>This image was shot with the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro. Much less a typical landscape lens than the 70/2.8, but that's what I'm after at the moment: atypical landscape shots. This one is about a juxtaposition between a line of trees and a line of poles, and most of all it is about depth.
