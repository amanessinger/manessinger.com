Blue skies, no clouds, sunny all the time, but yesterday the air was so full of haze, that I did not even think about shooting landscapes. Instead I drove to Villach in the evening, with the intention of shooting colored lights.<br/><br/>The original idea was to use the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro from the tripod and with much DOF. I wanted to stack shop signs and use the compression of the lens to create a surreal effect. The only problem was that, when I was there, I could not find anything of that kind. Tough.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080215_185317_nx_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080215_185317_nx_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Instead I shot shopping carts. In the green light of the flower shop they were a bit monochromatic, therefore I took #1 through some heavily defocused artificial flowers, and these are the flowers. Still, the Image of the Day is the monochromatic pattern of the stacked carts ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/beth-orton-shopping-trolley-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Shopping Trolley</a>" from Beth Orton's 2006 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Strangers-Beth-Orton/dp/B000CBSHK2" target="_blank">Comfort of Strangers</a>".
