That's a First! As I reported shortly, we had a computer crash in Carinthia. The PC would not boot at all. On Saturday afternoon we bought a new PC in Klagenfurt, and installing it, that's what I did since. What a weekend!<br/><br/>It finally turned out it was the system disc. It may have had a head-crash, something else may have have happened and may have taken down the disc as well, in any case it's gone. Good news is that I have not lost any image data, bad news is that we lost some other important things like emails. We'll let a specialist try to recover the data. So far my theory is, that most of the drive must be OK, and that most of the data must be recoverable. We'll see and I'll let you know.<br/><br/> The computer in Carinthia still lacks some software for image processing, that is to follow next weekend. Today I wouldn't have been able to use it anyway. <br/><br/>These are images of Wednesday. I have processed them on the train. Originally I would have liked to do Thursday as well, but I was too tired, and some of Thursday's images need my full attention ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I am still after those soft, blurry images, and over the course of the next days you'll see various approaches. Wednesday it was the Nikon 50/1.2. This is a manual focus lens and, honestly, it is a pain to use. On the other hand, in those cases when I manage to get what I want, I like what I get. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080423_083743_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080423_083743_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The first image is a detail of a carved pillar at the entrance to a Chinese restaurant. This is a place that I pass by very often, and I am attracted to the colors, especially on gray days. The environment is not overly beautiful, thus using a macro-like approach is probably a good idea. Of course this is no macro lens, not at all, but due to the extremely shallow depth of field, the look is not far from what macro shots look like.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080423_084022_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080423_084022_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The next image is one of my typical bicycle portraits, nothing new, and you may have seen the pose before. I still like the image, not the least for its colors. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080423_180732_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080423_180732_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The final image is a detail from Spittelberg, one of Vienna's more picturesque neighborhoods. I love the ivy and the mysterious oblique lines in the background.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.tsrocks.com/n/natalie_cole_texts/good_to_be_back.html" target="_blank">Good To Be Back</a>" from Natalie Cole's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Be-Back-Natalie-Cole/dp/B000002H9B" target="_blank">1989 album</a> of the same title.
