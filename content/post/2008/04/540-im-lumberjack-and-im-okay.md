I thought it was the baker who comes every Saturday morning. "I'm coming!", said I and dressed quickly, rushed to the door, opened it and ... saw cousin Peter smiling in my puzzled face, just like on this image, in full attire, saying: "C'mon, let's go and cut down some trees!". I'd give a lot for an image of my face ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It turned out that he was here to fell two trees near our house, just on the other side of the street. He said he needed me to watch for cars, and I thought I couldn't let him work alone, so I volunteered to help him. Well, two trees became eight, and when we were done with work it was four hours later.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day is from late afternoon. This is a pond near Klagenfurt and I love the reflections of the trees.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the "<a href="http://www.lyricsdepot.com/monty-python/lumberjack-song.html" target="_blank">Lumberjack Song</a>" from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sings-Monty-Python/dp/B000000WIA">Monty Python Sings</a>".
