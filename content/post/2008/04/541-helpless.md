I've installed <a href="http://www.eset.com/" target="_blank">ESET Internet Security</a> on two computers and tried a memory upgrade on two laptops. Well, ESET was a full success, just like on my computer in Vienna. Getting rid of Norton Internet Security and installing ESET was almost as effective as a processor upgrade. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>The memory upgrade did not go so well. I've bought 2 GB for a notebook that has 512 MB installed, the memory is faster than what came with the computer ... and it didn't work. I tried it then in my own notebook, same game, slightly faster memory, same result. Either I have bought defective memory, or notebooks are very much more sensitive to mismatches in memory timings. I've never before had problems with too fast memory. Oh well.<br/><br/>This image is from my 5 minutes photo session in the garden. That was it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Neil Young's "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/neil-young-helpless-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Helpless</a>", but not from "The Last Waltz", not from "Unplugged" and not even from Neil Young: Patti Smith sang it on her 2007 cover album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Patti-Smith/dp/B000NDEXIE" target="_blank">Twelve</a>", and someone on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSCuZYRXM0g" target="_blank">YouTube</a> has illustrated it with images from Wim Wenders' "Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin". Not the worst combination.
