Sometimes I come home and I am absolutely sure that I have no usable image. Well, turned out I had two. This is from Thursday, and both images were shot with the Nikon 18-200 VR.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/elvis+costello/this+house+is+empty+now_20047452.html" target="_blank">This House Is Empty Now</a>" from the Anne Sofie von Otter / Elvis Costello collaboration "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stars-Anne-Sofie-von-Otter/dp/B00005A46I" target="_blank">For the Stars</a>". Video-wise I don't have this version, but I have found one of Costello's collaboration with Burt Bacharach. See it on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=xID7AxShew0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
