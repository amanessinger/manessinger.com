Well, I mount a macro, take polarizer, tripod and umbrella, and go out into the garden. Boy, is this Sigma 70/2.8 sharp!<br/><br/>This was the first time that I fooled around with manual focus and Live View. Neat. For macro shooting I can't think of anything better.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "These Ain't Raindrops" from Percy Sledge's 1994 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Night-Percy-Sledge/dp/B000002U6H" target="_blank">Blue Night</a>". Sorry, neither lyrics nor video.
