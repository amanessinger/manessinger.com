A small park near my workplace has contributed the flowers, another park just on the other side of the road the tree. I really like to play with this kind of images, because they show the world in a way that we usually don't see. Basically you can use that effect to construct all kinds of strange worlds full of mystery and color.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080409_160351_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080409_160351_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The next image, taken only 50 meters from the tree, could not be more different. This is the backside of Volkstheater, one of Vienna's most prominent theater houses, specializing mostly on 20<sup>th</sup> century drama. The contrasts were extremely harsh and I'm pretty satisfied with the conversion to B&amp;W.<br/><br/>Finally there is the Image of the Day, a plastic tray in front of a second hand shop, with some books and a separator, obviously intended to be used with LP records, but no records are there, only this piece of fiber board with "Rolling Stones" written on it. Well, I guess you can't always get what you want ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>And of course <a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/the-rolling-stones-you-can-t-always-get-what-you-want-lyrics.html" target="_blank">that</a>'s the Song of the Day. It's originally from the 1969 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-Bleed-DSD-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006AW2G" target="_blank">Let It Bleed</a>". YouTube has quite some versions of it, for instance <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_PPQJV1EKc" target="_blank">this</a> really ecstatic one.
