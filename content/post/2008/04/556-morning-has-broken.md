It's again one of those fuzzy fore-/background images with only a tiny slice of reality in focus. I can't get enough of that at the moment. The incredibly interesting thing for me is, that you can create all sorts of effects, simply by moving some inches around. This time I used the Sigma 70/2.8 at f8 and 1/640s. The out-of-focus leaves are still pretty blurry, because I am focusing so damn near, but this time you have a vague impression of the city in the background.<br/><br/>I can't exactly claim that I planned the image that way. It's been more of an experiment, but in the future I know what I get at these settings.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.ultimatefreelyrics.com/Artist_C/Cat_Stevens_Lyrics/Morning_Has_Broken_Song_Lyrics.html" target="_blank">Morning Has Broken</a>" from Cat Stevens' 1971 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Teaser-Firecat-Cat-Stevens/dp/B00004T9W4" target="_blank">Teaser and the Firecat</a>".
