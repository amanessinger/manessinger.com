<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080408_081850_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080408_081850_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>On a construction site in Kaiserstra√üe, very near to where I live, I found this charcoal drawing on the wall of a building being demolished. A Jokerman, once drawn by a hopeful young revolutionary, and this reminds me of Ted Byrne's current blog entry, "<a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2008/04/quarry.html" target="_blank">Quarry</a>", where he muses about salavging "something that soon won't be anyplace but in an image". John Henry Mills or the Jokerman, one will wither with time, one will be torn down with force. There are stories behind both, and though the stories will be lost, these images remain, and they will begin to tell their own stories.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/jokerman.html" target="_blank">Jokerman</a>" is the opener (and I think it was the hit) on Bob Dylan's 1983 Return-From-Jesus album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Infidels-Bob-Dylan/dp/B00026WU4G" target="_blank">Infidels</a>". See it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igMaEw3SJuk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
