You know those machines that are train wagons themselves, yellow and black like a wasp, sprinkled with red details and warning and information signs of all sorts, signs that are completely incomprehensibe to the uninitiated.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/jethro-tull-part-of-the-machine-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Part Of The Machine</a>" from the 1987 Jethro Tull album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crest-Knave-Jethro-Tull/dp/B00070DK1E" target="_blank">Crest Of A Knave</a>".
