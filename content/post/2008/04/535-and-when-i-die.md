Before the Nazi barbarism Vienna had quite some Jewish population, and so it is not surprising that the Jewish part of the cemetery is vast. When I was there for the first time, about 15 years ago, it was completely overgrown, basically a forest, but since then much has changed. From a merely aesthetic point of view it was more beautiful then, but even now it is a tranquil place of peace.<br/><br/>Graveyards and B&amp;W, that may be more or less a clich√©, but I simply could not resist. I have tried it both ways, and B&amp;W won by far.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/blood-sweat-and-tears-and-when-i-die-lyrics.html" target="_blank">And When I Die</a>" from the self-titled second <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Sweat-Tears/dp/B00004XSVH" target="_blank">Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears</a> album.
