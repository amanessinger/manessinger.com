I have been on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Marx_cemetery" target="_blank">St. Marx Cemetery</a> today. It was a gray, windy day, with only traces of sunshine very late in the afternoon. This cemetery is out of use since 1874, but it is open to the public and it boasts the grave of none lesser than Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In reality, only 17 years after his death nobody knew where he was buried any more, and I guess the place marked today is as authentic as the average Saint's relic, but as with Saints, this has never stopped people believing.<br/><br/>I was rather late, only three quarters of an hour before closing time at 5pm, thus I didn't even bother looking for Mozart. I was looking for the angels.<br/><br/>Angels? Yes, angels. Statues of angels are very common on old graves in Vienna. Of course they get much photographed and therefore this image is hardly original, but actually I don't care.  If I did, I would have to stop photographing in Vienna at all, and not only in Vienna, actually in every place where people photograph, which probably comprises 150% of the beautiful places in this world ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recordare" target="_blank">Recordare</a>" from Mozart's "Requiem". Of the six or seven versions that I have, I have chosen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mozart-Maurerische-Trauermusik-Stephan-Schreckenberger/dp/B0000017PX" target="_blank">Jordi Savall</a> and his orchestra "Le Concert des Nations", but I guess this does not matter as much as it matters with baroque or earlier music. On <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxhAZG7CIfs" target="_blank">YouTube</a> you may hear (among others) the Symphony Orchestra of Ljubljana under Vladislav Tchernushenko, and they do it quite as well.
