It's Saturday morning now. The computer in Carinthia seems to have died a sudden death. Yesterday evening I wanted to begin working on the entry for Tuesday, suddenly the screen went black and this was it. Rebooting does not help. The computer seems to hang. I can't tell for sure, because it does not display anything. It worked only so long as to let me move my images of the last week from my portable hard drive. <br/><br/>"<span style="font-style:italic;">MOVE</span>" is the word, yes. I can't remember ever having moved my data from the portable drive to one of my computers. I always copy. Well, this time I did not, and that means the images of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are now on a hard drive that I cannot access. I still have them in Vienna as well, but that does not help me at all at the moment.<br/><br/>At the moment I write from my laptop. I have everything I need for image processing installed, thus I could work on it. Grrrr .... what a mess!
