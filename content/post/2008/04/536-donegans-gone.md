In reality, I have to admit, I don't know this man, but one thing's for sure, he can't be Donegan, because Donegan's gone.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/mark-knopfler-donegan-s-gone-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Donegan's Gone</a>" from Mark Knopfler's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shangri-Mark-Knopfler/dp/B0002VKZL6" target="_blank">Shangri-La</a>". See him perform it live and explain the story on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ELEVqpFeuU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing: <a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bill Birtch has a new blog</a>, so if you link to him, it's time to update now. For the time being I keep the <a href="http://web.mac.com/wbirtch/iWeb/B%20Birtch%20Photo/PhotoBlog/PhotoBlog.html" target="_blank">old link</a> as well. Much too much great stuff there ðŸ™‚
