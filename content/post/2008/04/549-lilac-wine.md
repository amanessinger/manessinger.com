Well, it's Tuesday morning 5:30 now, I have just woken up) when I went to work, I still had the Sigma 70/2.8 Macro mounted from the weekend's macro sessions. Boy, did that lens feel good on the street! It's that combination of a short telephoto lens with the incredible control of depth of field. I absolutely love using this lens wide open.<br/><br/>In the end I have only worked on this single image. There are some others that would be worthwhile (and that I would have taken anytime on a lesser day), one that I'll try again because of too tight framing, and a gorgeous bicycle that was unfortunately marred by litter on the ground that I failed to see and remove. What's wrong with Photoshop, you ask? Well, have you ever tried to clone behind the spokes of a bicycle's wheel? Believe me, there are selections you don't want to make ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://boscarol.com/nina/html/where/lilacwine.html" target="_blank">Lilac Wine</a>" by the great Nina Simone. I have it on the collection of her Philips recordings "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Women-Simone-Philips-Recordings/dp/B00006ZU6B" target="_blank">For Women</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PT2FMjK7IU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
