<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080118_233117_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080118_233117_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>It's Friday. As I write this, I'm on the train to Carinthia, and as on so many Fridays, I have no substantial image. On the other hand, I have just worked on the cover images for a CD. Remember "<a href="/2008/01/462-congeniality.html" target="_blank">462 - Congeniality</a>"? At that concert I had shot more than 300 images, using Wolfgang's Nikon 80-200/2.8, and now that a CD is coming out, I was asked to supply the cover images. <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080119_001201_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080119_001201_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> On the back cover will be the empty room after the concert, and on the front a detail of a saxophone. We don't show musicians, because the CD will cover the best of four concerts of different bands. The actual image on the cover will be a square crop of the lower part, here I show the original composition.<br/><br/>I'm pretty satisfied how well the sax comes out. The image was shot in extremely low light at 200mm, f3.2, 1/100s and ISO 5600. For that it's rather smooth ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Regarding the Song of the Day, my choice of music here on the train is restricted to what's on my IAUDIO X5 60GB music player, and unfortunately I have not much Jazz on it. Still, "Straight Up And Down" from Eric Dolphy's 1964 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-Lunch-Eric-Dolphy/dp/B00000I8UK" target="_blank">Out To Lunch</a>" will do, will it? No video, sorry, but Amazon's sound sample is actually quite good.
