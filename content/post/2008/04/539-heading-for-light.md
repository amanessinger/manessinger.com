This is the image for Friday, taken with the Nikon 18-200 VR.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/travelling+wilburys/heading+for+the+light_20140464.html" target="_blank">Heading For The Light</a>" from the first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traveling-Wilburys-CD-DVD/dp/B000P0J024" target="_blank">Traveling Wilburys</a> album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FUBWbHDp2s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080404_075927_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080404_075927_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> EDIT: I have uploaded a new version of this image. The old one was too bluish in the center part. It was ugly. I guess this one is not ðŸ™‚ <br/><br/>If you really, really must have it: here is the old version. Honestly, I must have been blind.
