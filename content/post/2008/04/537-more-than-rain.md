I shot it on my way home. Rain had just stopped, the sun was back again, and I saw this gorgeous Mini Cooper, wet and sparkling all over with reflections. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080402_180212_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080402_180212_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The other two images were made only minutes later, on the same street. I had not expected much more than rain, but I got a big bunch of colors instead. Who would complain? <br/><br/>It's interesting. All three images were made with the Nikon 18-200 VR. Well, when you look into the sidebar and scroll way down to the labels, then you'll see that the 18-200 is by far my most used lens. OK, what's interesting now? Well, the interesting thing is, that I have used the Sigma 70/2.8 almost exclusively for about four months, suddenly I am back to the 18-200, and now I stick with that. Don't ask me about my inspiration, but that's how funny it works ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-more-than-rain-lyrics.html">More Than Rain</a>" from Tom Waits' classic "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franks-Wild-Years-Tom-Waits/dp/B000001FSR" target="_blank">Franks Wild Years</a>".
