I could not find a balance between the bright colors of the lights in the background and the muted brownish, muddy tones elsewhere. I tried different temperatures, but when the dark of the background looked right, everything else fell apart. I tried a B&amp;W conversion with a mask over the lights, but that was even worse. It looked badly colored and plain ugly. And then it occurred to me: this is a B&amp;W image!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.tsrocks.com/h/hazel_oconnor_texts/take_a_ride.html" target="_blank">Take A Ride</a>" from Hazel O'Connor's 1998 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/5-Morning-Hazel-OConnor/dp/B000007P2Y" target="_blank">5 in the Morning</a>". Sorry, no video.
