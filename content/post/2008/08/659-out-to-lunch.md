Well, turned out they were not, and although I had shot 72 images during the day, I was in big trouble. Whatever I touched fell apart. In my plight I finally settled with this image. It was taken during a late lunch in a very peculiar restaurant, the "<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=de&geocode=&q=finkenstein&sll=48.209206,16.372778&sspn=0.233371,0.42572&ie=UTF8&ll=46.569733,13.851657&spn=0.007523,0.013304&t=h&z=16" target="_blank">Marktcaf√©</a>" of "<a href="http://www.finkensteiner-nudelfabrik.com/" target="_blank">Finkensteiner Nudelfabrik</a>" near Villach. Fantastic noodle dishes. Should you happen to be in the surroundings, give it a try. Reservation recommended at dinner time.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "Out To Lunch", is from Eric Dolphy's classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Out-Lunch-Eric-Dolphy/dp/B00000I8UK">1964 album</a> of the same name. No video. What did you think?
