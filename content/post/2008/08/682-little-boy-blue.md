I already photographed this tiny bicycle once and then did not use the image, so here it is again today, this time cropped to a square.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Tom Waits' "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-little-boy-blue-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Little Boy Blue</a>", sung by the wonderful Holly Cole on her albums "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Temptation-Holly-Cole/dp/B000005GZ4" target="_blank">Temptation</a>" and the live album "It Happened One Night" (at least it's on my copy of the Japanese version). See her perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDRrErJHcCY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Good news is, that she seems widely available now, and Amazon even has sound samples of most of her albums. I suggest, if you don't know her yet, check her out. You won't regret it.
