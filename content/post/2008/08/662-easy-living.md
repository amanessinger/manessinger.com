At the moment I have the Nikon 18-200 VR mounted, originally by chance, just because I had needed it for Sunday's flower session, and now I use it at full 200mm to photograph ... people. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080805_182413_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080805_182413_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I have two images today, a warm and a cool one. Let's begin with cool. I took this image while sitting in the patio of a restaurant. The frame fascinated me, I had time, and so I waited for interesting people to pass through. Compositionally I probably like this image better, it only lost color-wise.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was shot a little earlier, in bright sunshine, and I absolutely love the colors of the shop and this relaxed, sleepy summer afternoon feeling. And of course those walls that remind me of my childhood, when I grew up in an old house with warm, yellow walls.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/bryan-ferry-easy-living-lyrics.html">Easy Living</a>" from Bryan Ferry's 1999 standards album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/As-Time-Goes-Bryan-Ferry/dp/B00001ZSTJ">As Time Goes By</a>".
