This is the image for Monday, taken Monday afternoon. Weird reflections on the pavement. I would have had some more images, but at the moment I am completely unable to process them ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricsfly.com/search/view.php?95db5562de&view=333206">Hello Sunshine</a>" from Aretha Franklin's 1968 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aretha-Now-Franklin/dp/B00000331L">Aretha Now</a>". Hear the sound sample there and hear Wilson Pickett's version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz5YftunguY">YouTube</a>.
