He only toiled with his luggage and basically was there. This is one of four images of the scene, and this is the one where the configuration was just right. Searching for a title, I found "<a href="http://www.springsteenlyrics.com/lyrics/y/youcanlook.php">You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)</a>" from Bruce Springsteen's 1980 masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/River-Bruce-Springsteen/dp/B0000025KI">The River</a>". Nice version on the album, but you really have to see it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJzfzIq4-38">live on YouTube</a>. What a performer! Go, see it now. I mean it ðŸ™‚
