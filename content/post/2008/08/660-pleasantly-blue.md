As yesterday's attempts had been completely fruitless, I decided to return today and try it again, this time not with the 85/1.8 but with the 18-200 at 200 mm. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080803_170641_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080803_170641_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Seems like I was right. What you need in  such a case is not shallow depth of field (it will be shallow anyway, don't care), what you need is compression. Look for a lump of blue flowers, go near, shoot right through it onto some yellow or orange flowers in the middleground. That's exactly what I wanted.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/4-non-blondes-pleasantly-blue-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Pleasantly Blue</a>" from the 1992 4 Non Blondes album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bigger-Better-Faster-More-Blondes/dp/B000001Y5D" target="_blank">Bigger, Better, Faster, More!</a>".
