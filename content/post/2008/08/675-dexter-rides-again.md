I don't do it very often, but sometimes it is a no-brainer, for instance when there is not much color to begin with.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080818_084125_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080818_084125_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I shot these two images yesterday morning on my way to work, and the interesting thing is, that I had something totally different in mind. I wanted to use the long lens to capture the hundreds of cables above our streets, long rows of light fixtures dancing in between. In fact I did and the images were not even bad, at least workable in any case, but then this image of a bicycle rider came in between, and somehow everything else paled.<br/><br/>Does this happen to you as well? That you go out with a certain goal, determined to concentrate on a certain kind of subject, and then the unexpected happens? What do you do? Do you give in as I did?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080818_172238_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080818_172238_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> For all who don't like B&amp;W, here is something in color. Although, it's graffiti on a garage door, and <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">some people</a> don't like graffiti either ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Dexter Rides Again" by Dexter Gordon. I have it on disc 84 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>". I even found a sound sample. It's the background music to a video about "<a href="http://hk.youtube.com/watch?v=7m4fhs__kAI" target="_blank">HAM RadioðŸ˜›L-259 Installation Made Easy and FUNny</a>". Oh well.
