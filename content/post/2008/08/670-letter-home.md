It was a gloomy day, all the time on the verge of drowning Vienna, but surprisingly it finally didn't. I shot this image very near home, it's what I call a desparation shot, but for that it turned out pretty nice.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.elviscostello.info/lyrics/tjl.html" target="_blank">The Letter Home</a>" from Elvis Costello's 1993 collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Juliet-Letters/dp/B000EBGEMI" target="_blank">The Juliet Letters</a>". I have linked to the double CD re-issue, I have the 1993 single CD original. Some bonus tracks can't be wrong, can they? See <a href="http://shop.klassikakzente.de/detailanz/produktanzeige.rt?prid=99537" target="_blank">here</a> for a sound sample.
