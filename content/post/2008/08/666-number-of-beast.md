Of the two fence images that I shot Saturday morning, it was clear that I would take the vertical. The images were uploaded to SmugMug, and the only thing amiss was a title. Don't you feel that, due to the strong compression at 300mm, both images look like gentle, rolling waves? I contemplated "Waves" by the Hooverphonic as title, but neither could I find a video on YouTube, nor was the text exactly fitting. These images certainly don't evoke the feeling of sea waves in the night.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080809_071206_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080809_071206_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> OK, I thought, let's look for "Morning" as a keyword. "New Morning" by Nick Cave? Wow, a song like a religious epiphany, an explosion of pathos, ... "The sky was a kingdom / All covered in blood" ... I couldn't. I have to save this song for the most impressive sunrise that I'll ever encounter.<br/><br/>"Fool On The Hill"? Probably, but whose version? I was ready to go with Aretha Franklin, but still, it didn't seem to fit. Maybe something different? Something like "Air" by The Incredible String Band? No way, already used for "<a href="/2007/02/128-rural-quietude.html" target="_blank">128 - Rural Quietude</a>". Still, this would have been the mood.<br/><br/>"Don't Fence Me In"? The David Byrne version? I must have used that, have I? No, I have not and there is even a video. Hmm ... Holly Cole would be even better, but as usual with her songs, no video, not even a sound sample on Amazon. Damn.<br/><br/>Having nothing really compelling, I went back to Aretha's "Fool On The Hill" (or probably really the original by The Beatles?), and just as I wrote the caption on SmugMug, I recognized the number!<br/><br/>Oh my, I could have saved a lot of time. Thankfully I had a fitting image, shot yesterday as well.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilyoung/ridemyllama.html" target="_blank">Ride My Llama</a>" from Neil Young's 1979 masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Sleeps-Young-Crazy-Horse/dp/B000002KDG" target="_blank">Rust Never Sleeps</a>".
