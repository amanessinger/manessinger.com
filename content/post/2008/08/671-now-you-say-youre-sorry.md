Boy, a song written for Ella, so her version must be pretty much the best, huhh?? Wrong. Nobody ever sang this song with more icy disdain than Barbra Streisand on her 1963 debut "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Barbra-Streisand-Album/dp/B0000029BE" target="_blank">The Barbra Streisand Album</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd5rsPdZydA&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. On the other hand, Ella's version is, well, what can I say, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHVMxBkW0CQ" target="_blank">it's Ella</a>. It's only not the right emotion ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Edit: Oh dear, I just found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XggjVo3j-o&feature=related" target="_blank">another version by Ella</a>. Had to share this as well. WOW!
