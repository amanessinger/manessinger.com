Did I ever say I love VR?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080819_215732_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080819_215732_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The second is a Harley that I simply could not ignore. Even for 70mm and already with my back against the wall, I was a tad near, thus the composition. Still, with the rails in the background, I think it works.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day is straight from the camera. Why exactly this image? Well, it's something in the gesture of the child, something carefree, something trusting, something comfortable that appealed top me.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/kate-bush-mother-stands-for-comfort-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Mother Stands For Comfort</a>", is from Kate Bush's 1985 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hounds-Love-Kate-Bush/dp/B00004R7TP" target="_blank">Hounds of Love</a>".
