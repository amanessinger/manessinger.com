The threat of threats, the downfall of Western Civilization<sup>TM</sup>, a Turkish woman wearing a scarf! It's election time again in Austria, and the two biggest parties, those that were in a coalition for merely two years now, are going to lose big time. At least that's what the prophets say.<br/><br/>What does this mean? More votes for a democratic, constructive opposition? No, of course not. The extreme right is predicted to be the big winner, and of course they blame foreigners for whatever runs wrong in this state, and of course it's most of all against Muslim minorities like the Turks. In fact we have quite a strong Turkish minority here in Vienna, in some parts of some districts they are even the majority now. Frightening, huhh??? All those scarves!<br/><br/>Oh well!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.jumbojimbo.com/lyrics.php?songid=4431" target="_blank">A Stranger In Town</a>" by Dinah Washington. I have it on disc 2 of the collection "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Dinah-Washington-Mercury-Vol/dp/B00000479G" target="_blank">The Complete Dinah Washington on Mercury, Vol. 7</a>". Pretty pricey nowadays.
