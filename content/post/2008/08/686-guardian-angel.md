These are the days when I have no time to spare, the days when I travel from Vienna to Carinthia, and on most Fridays I have trouble to come up with something usable. When I'm lucky, I manage to find it in the morning, when I'm not, I leave work for the Underground, knowing that I have about 500 meters with no time to stop, and by then I have to have an image. This was such a Friday.<br/><br/>Weather was less than optimal, it did just not rain, and when I looked across the street, I saw this angel watching over two windows with reddish curtains. That was it, in my hurry I could not find anything more. <br/><br/>Esther Emma Jongste, <a href="http://fotoemma.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blogger</a> and creator of one of my most favorite SoFoBoMo contributions, "<a href="http://issuu.com/estheremma/docs/sofobomo" target="_blank">Colorful Daily Details</a>", recently asked me if I always have a plan how to process an image. My answer was, that I normally just play around, have some techniques ready, try things and simply go along in the direction where it looks good. It is a bit like having a big block of marble, and instead of exactly knowing how the statue will look like, you chip a little here, a little there, and while you take stone away, a form emerges.<br/><br/>Well, this image was different. In this case I exactly knew what I wanted and how I wanted to get there. The steps were quite similar to those in "<a href="/2008/08/683-welcome-to-republic.html" target="_blank">683 - Welcome To The Republic</a>". Nice, popping red, huh??<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/lou+reed/guardian+angel_20207739.html" target="_blank">Guardian Angel</a>" from Lou Reed's 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raven-Lou-Reed/dp/B00007BKGL" target="_blank">The Raven</a>".
