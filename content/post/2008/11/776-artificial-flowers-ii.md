They had some artificial flowers, I made some images, rather uninspiredly, and this was it for the day. <br/><br/> Today, Friday, on the train, I was already prepared to work on some old image and make another exception, but then this strange ambition took hold of me, I began revisiting yesterday's images, and to my surprise I was really able to squeeze something like a composition out of them ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>A year and a half ago I posted the <a href="/2007/03/147-artificial-flowers.html" target="_blank">first image</a> with this title, and again the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beautiful+south/artificial+flowers_20015230.html" target="_blank">Artificial Flowers</a>" from the Beautiful South's 1997 album "Blue is the Color".
