Tomorrow I'll have to get up early, and here on the train I have enough time to get creative ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This is an image that I shot in the morning in the staircase of the house where I live. Don't ask me what I thought while post-proceessing, honestly, I can't tell. This is one of those images that "happen" while I explore.<br/><br/> I tried some things, kept some, dismissed others, and overall I like what I've got. But even if I can't tell you what this image means to me, probably you could tell me what it means to you, will you?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/everything_is_broken.html" target="_blank">Everything Is Broken</a>", but not in the version originally released on the 1985 Bob Dylan album "Oh Mercy", no, we'll take the alternate version on the 2008 official bootleg album "Tell Tale Signs". Great album, just don't buy the completely overpriced three CD edition. This is not for fans, it's for idiots ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lHd1iMPtDk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
