Today is the day of the final move to Villach. So far the weather is fine, let's hope it stays free of rain.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/aretha-franklin-a-change-is-gonna-come-lyrics.html" target="_blank">A Change Is Gonna Come</a>" from the 1967 Aretha Franklin album "I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You". Sorry, no time to search on YouTube. I have to shut the computer down. See you on the other side ðŸ™‚
