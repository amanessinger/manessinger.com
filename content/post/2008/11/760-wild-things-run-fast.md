Well, here we go ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I saw this guy coming at high speed and barely had time to focus on the place where I wanted to capture him. It is not tack sharp, but it turned out quite OK.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081111_173745_DxO_raw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081111_173745_DxO_raw.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The other two images of today are bicycles only. All three have been converted with DxO Optics Pro used as import filter for Photoshop. That's another thing that irritates me: DxO seems to strip EXIF data, at least it is not carried over to Photoshop. On the other hand, maybe I should take some time and RTFM ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081111_173314_DxO_raw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081111_173314_DxO_raw.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The other image has something mysterious to me. I guess it must come from the fire hydrant in the foreground and from this suggestion of hiding and peeping.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://ww.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joni_mitchell/wild_things_run_fast.html" target="_blank">Wild Things Run Fast</a>" from Joni Mitchell's 1982 album of the same name.
