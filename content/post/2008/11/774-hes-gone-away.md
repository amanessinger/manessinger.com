In fact, I was moving the camera up and down while walking. Must have been a sight, really ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081125_164225_dxo_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081125_164225_dxo_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I did a whole bunch of such today, some similarly experimental, some rather conventional. Most of them I've thrown away, either immediately or at home, but of those that remained, I want to share two others.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081125_174053.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081125_174053.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The first is conventional. A night scene on the streets of Vienna, but with a nice distribution of lights and colors, and most of all with that wonderful pattern in the clouds, just in the right position. This was the first or second image in a series, some of them had more interesting people, better sharpness, whatever, but none could remotely match these clouds.<br/><br/> The other image is of an hour later. It was full night now, and I played around with a subject that I use every once in a while: reflections of lights on a car, shot wide open, focused near, in front of a background of blurred lights. This last image is right out of the camera, with no post-processing at all.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is from another CD that I've bought Saturday afternoon. It's the old song "<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080207124035AA1Qi4z" target="_blank">He's Gone Away</a>", sung by Tanya Haden on "Rambling Boy", an album by "Charlie Haden, Family and Friends", friends including Pat Metheny and Elvis Costello among many others. See a video about the album on Amazon's page.
