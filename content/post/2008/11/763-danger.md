Currently this self-assigned duty is the means for all kinds of surveillance, the means to amass more and more information about us, the excuse to create the perfect infrastructure for the next dictatorship. <br/><br/>No need to worry, we're a democracy? I'd like to believe it, but so was Germany before the Nazi, Spain before Franco, Chile before Pinochet. Yes, all that had reasons and they don't apply today, but isn't it naive to expect that those things always happen the same way? <br/><br/> But let's put the big issues aside. Let's look a those small, silly embraces that get into our way every day. Let's for instance look at this sign. It says <blockquote><span style="font-style:italic;">ATTENTION!<br/>Facade damaged<br/>Passage denied!</span></blockquote>Huuhh?? This facade is about 20 meters away, has been restored only some years ago and is perfectly OK. Are they kidding? Well, in post-processing I have tried to make the facade look a tad more dangerous and ominous, but even then you can't dispute the distance.<br/><br/>While I stood there and reviewed the image on the camera's rear LCD, a jogger jumped the chain, not even ignoring the sign. This world is not a completely stupid place after all ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/eric_clapton_lyrics_2113/the_road_to_escondido_lyrics_32090/danger_lyrics_347367.html" target="_blank">Danger</a>" from the 2006 cooperation of Eric Clapton and J. J. Cale "The Road to Escondido". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lgA5KJpjEY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
