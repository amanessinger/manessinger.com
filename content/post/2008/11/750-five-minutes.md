I managed to free five minutes for photography, but only in the evening, long after sundown. The only image that could even remotely be used was this. I concentrated on enhancing the colors, bringing out the color contrast, and that was it. This is not the building where I'll live in Villach, it's the building next door. You'll have to get accommodated to modern architecture ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsbox.com/stranglers-lyrics-5-minutes-x3m7c7w.html" target="_blank">5 Minutes</a>" by The Stranglers. I have it on a collection "Hits and Heroes" and on the 1997 album "Friday the Thirteenth: Live at the Royal Albert Hall". See them live on <a href="http://vodpod.com/watch/57351-the-stranglers-5-minutes" target="_blank">vodpod</a>.
