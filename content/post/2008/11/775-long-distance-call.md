It's winter time, and the worst thing is not the cold, no, it's the light, or rather the lack thereof. I leave home in the morning either in a cruel, gray mock of dawn, or I am so much in a hurry, that I have to bypass photographing at all.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081126_201543_dxo_raw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081126_201543_dxo_raw.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> In the evening, when I leave work, the sun is already gone. In fact, it would hardly suffice to leave work at 3pm to get some last light, and that's not an option most of the time. <br/><br/> So, what can I do? It's the time to turn to experiments, city lights, shop windows, and to see what I can get. Yesterday was "shopping day". Most of the images that I made were from shop windows in Lerchenfelder StraÃŸe and Neubaugasse.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_gray/long_distance_call.html" target="_blank">Long Distance Call</a>" from the 2002 David Gray album "A New Day at Midnight". Well, not so bad a name these days ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>See a video live in Sheffield on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT353_tG7aY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. This is a slower version than on the album. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxI3gtvwZw&feature=related" target="_blank">Another video</a> from Cleveland is more like the album version, but has pretty unbearable sound.
