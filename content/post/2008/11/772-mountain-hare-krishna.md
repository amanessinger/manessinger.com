My first idea was to watch a sunset on mount Dobratsch, the mountain where I've watched the sun rise and set <a href="/search/label/Dobratsch">many times</a>, but I did not manage to get up in time, and it wouldn't have been spectacular anyway, as the sky was completely clear.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081123_142348.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081123_142348.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Instead I took the car in the early afternoon and drove half way up to slightly below 3000 ft, where I parked on the side of the road and tried my luck in the forest near the abyss.<br/><br/>I decided to leave all other lenses in the car and only take the camera with the Sigma 50/1.4 mounted. Actually I had no idea that I would spend almost an hour in that place, shooting forest landscapes, patches of snow, rocks, grass, details and big vistas.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081123_142218.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081123_142218.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> I was not far from the road, but there was almost complete silence and peace. It was like stepping out of your life, forgetting everything before and after, only breathing the magic in this mountain wilderness.<br/><br/>I have explained the details before, but it is always fascinating to think of the fact that this mountain broke apart twice, once in prehistoric times and once due to a devastating earthquake in 1348. Therefore the southern flank is a steep abyss.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081123_144314.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081123_144314.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Standing up there, looking down at the highway below, it's hard to avoid a fit of vertigo.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "Mountain Hare Krishna" from Krishna Das' 1998 album "Pilgrim Heart", a duet sung together with Sting. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WpdSh8VYd4&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I spare you the lyrics, they are sort of ... simple ðŸ™‚
