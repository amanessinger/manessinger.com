I'm being held up here in Carinthia, and I even find some time to take pictures. Today's were all shot in the morning. I had to pick up some letters at the old address, right at the time when the fog cleared.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081117_122421.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081117_122421.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Nice shoreline, huh? It's only about a foot high, but it sure looks grown up. This is the bed of one of the countless creeks that come down the border mountains in the south. They are a limestone ridge all along Carinthia's southern border, rising up only a little more than 2000 meters in their peaks, but due to their geology, they look incredibly impressive. Mittagskogel is one of them.<br/><br/>We had this particular creek quite some time ago in a slightly more <a href="/2007/09/338-landscape-woes.html" target="_blank">realistic view</a>. Its water is clear and icy cold. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081117_113847_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081117_113847_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> A forest with fog just dissipating, that's an interesting view. I did not have the time to venture forth, this is only one image taken from out of the car (no, not while driving) with the Nikon 18-200 VR at 200mm, but I love this filtered light and the depth that we see due to the remains of fog.<br/><br/> For a change, the image of the day is centered. Martin Gommel over at <a href="http://kwerfeldein.de/" target="_blank">Kwerfeldein.de</a> recently posted a <a href="http://kwerfeldein.de/index.php/2008/11/13/bildvorstellung-lonely/" target="_blank">reminder</a> that centered compositions are by no means forbidden - and he is right. Sometimes it simply works and here it does.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/hooverphonic/the+magnificent+tree_20065982.html" target="_blank">The Magnificent Tree</a>" from the 2000 Hooverphonic album of the same name. Hear an admittedly weak live version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2P3KqEjHJk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Well, probably this kind of music simply ages faster than what I normally hear ðŸ™‚
