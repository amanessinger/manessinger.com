My original idea to set the camera to long exposures in the range of one or two seconds and to use in-camera motion blur came from seeing recent entries on <a href="http://lightscrape.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Juha Haataja</a>'s blog, and of course such experiments were greatly evangelized by <a href="http://martijeffers.com/myview/" target="_blank">Marti Jeffers</a> and <a href="http://www.craigtannercreative.com/lightdiary" target="_blank">Craig Tanner</a>. <br/><br/> Seems like community is not an empty word. Thanks to you all ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/enya/trainsandwinterrains.html" target="_blank">Trains And Winter Rains</a>", the single from the new Enya album "And Winter Came". See the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3GmF_YlJbs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Isn't it a nice trend that labels begin to creatively use YouTube instead of trying to sue them?
