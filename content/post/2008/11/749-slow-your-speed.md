Sometimes, in times of stress, you simply have to slow your speed.<br/><br/>Slowing my speed is also what I did Friday morning before the shopping marathon in Klagenfurt. I took a short detour through a forest, left the car, made five or six images of the wet, dripping forest and only then went on. They should be the last images at that day.<br/><br/>Other than that, I received an award called "Kreativ Blogger Award".<br/>This is a very peculiar thing, similar to a pyramid game or a chain letter, but without any false promises of fortune or threats of doom. The rules are to list six things that make you happy, and then to pass it on to six other bloggers. Fairly easy, huh?<br/><br/>I received the award through Janine L. Thun's fine Photography blog "a photo a day". As always: have a look at her blog, it always pays ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Out of interest and because I wanted to trace this award back, I went back the direct chain, i.e. always looked only at the way the award got to me, and here it is:<br/><div align="center"><a href="http://1-photo-a-day.blogspot.com/2008/10/128-kreativ-award.html" target="_blank">Janine's "a photo a day"</a><br/><a href="http://omami.wordpress.com/2008/10/30/kreativ-award/" target="_blank">Omami photographie</a><br/><a href="http://bandungdailyphoto.com/2008/10/colors-of-street-2.html" target="_blank">Bandung Daily Photo</a><br/><a href="http://oeirasdailyphoto.blogspot.com/2008/10/kreativ-blogger-award.html" target="_blank">Oeiras and environs daily photo</a> and <a href="http://chibadailyphoto.blogspot.com/2008/10/haiku-poetry-sun-set.html">Funabashi Daily Cell Phone Photo</a><br/><a href="http://madridailyphoto.blogspot.com/2008/10/kreativ-blogger-award.html" target="_blank">(MAD) daily photo</a><br/><a href="http://niamhphotography.blogspot.com/2008/10/day-at-park.html" target="_blank">Barcelona Daily Photo Blog</a><br/><a href="http://marie6-myworld.blogspot.com/2008/10/another-much-appreciated-award.html" target="_blank">Malta Magic - Laetitia's World</a><br/><br/>now leaving photography<br/><br/><a href="http://binksday.blogspot.com/2008/10/bling-for-da-binks.html" target="_blank">A day in the life of Binks</a><br/><a href="http://jilljillbobill.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-inyour-wallet.html" target="_blank">Jill Jill Bo Bill</a><br/><a href="http://amylowrey.blogspot.com/2008/10/here-i-am.html" target="_blank">Amelia Bedelia</a><br/><br/>...<br/></div><br/>This is back to October 11, and everyone on this list has passed it on to five others as well, and they to six others and each of them ... Only some days and it will have reached every blogger in the world. One could argue that it is stupid to pass this on, one could argue about devaluation by inflation, but this is not really about long chains, numbers of recipients or such things, it is only about a relationship between the giver and the recipient. It does not matter where it was, it there is any connection between me and the chain five links away (there ain't), it only matters that I got it from Janine and that I feel honored about that. That's the reason why I'll play by the rules.<br/><br/>The six things that make me happy are:<br/><ol><li>Love</li><li>Photography</li><li>Music</li><li>Sun</li><li>Water</li><li>Cats</li></ol><br/>So now, to whom should I pass on the burden? "Kreativ" means "creative". This hints at a German or Dutch origin of the award, and I want to take it literal. My choices (in alphabetical order) are<br/><ul><li><a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bill Birtch</a> for his example</li><li><a href="http://photomusings.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Paul Butzi</a> for SoFoBoMo</li><li><a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a> for inspiration and provocation</li><li><a href="http://ishotmyselftheydidtoo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Aaron Hobson</a> for a new Art</li><li><a href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Paul Lester</a> for his spirit</li><li>and of course <a href="http://www.craigtannercreative.com/lightdiary/" target="_blank">Craig Tanner</a> for the most wonderful photography sites in the world</li></ul><br/> The Song of the Day is "Slow Your Speed" by Jimmy Witherspoon. I have it on disc 62 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", but you may for example get it on "Urban Blues Singing Legend 1951-1953".  I've linked to the download version, because there you can hear a sample.
