I decided to make another foray into the southern neighborhood - and it was a wrong decision.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081116_154043_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081116_154043_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> To the south of Villach, the river Gail runs from west to east along a chain of small hills. South of the river, parallel to it, is the highway, and then comes forest. I wanted to follow the river on its southern shore, but after crossing, I found that the few roads would all take me away from the river, towards the highway. The first image was taken shortly before I crossed below the highway.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081116_162127_dxo_raw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081116_162127_dxo_raw.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> On the southern side of the highway I followed a small road along the highway to the west, fully expecting that it would lead me either further south or after a while back below the highway and to the river. It only didn't so. It lead on and on through the forest, following the highway, and then simply ended. Well, I left the car and made some forest images, one of them turned out to be the Image of the Day. Maybe no wrong decision after all.<br/><br/> The last image is another view of Mittagskogel, Villach's prominent landmark to the south, at the border to Slovenia. I shot it after my return, from the bridge over river Gail.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/stiltskin/rest_in_peace.html" target="_blank">Rest In Peace</a>" from the 1994 Stiltskin album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Minds-Eye-Stiltskin/dp/B0008551BA" target="_blank">The Mind's Eye</a>".
