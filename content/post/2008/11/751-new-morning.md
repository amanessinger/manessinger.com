This time I was lucky. <br/><br/>Yesterday morning I went out to take some images of the morning fog. I wanted to go for remote details, thus I took the Sigma 50/1.4 off and replaced it with the Nikon 70-300 VR. This was chance and happened out of a fancy. <br/><br/> Then I had zoomed out to 300mm to take an image of the trees on the pasture down by the side of the street. There was no sun and I intended a gloomy November image, but just in that moment a rift in the cloud opened and a streak of light rapidly shifted across the scene.<br/><br/>Arguably the arrangement of the three trees is not perfect, but every thought of moving only 20 meters to the left was ridiculous. The moment was over in seconds. I could only accept it with a shrug.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/bob-dylan-new-morning-lyrics.html" target="_blank">New Morning</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1970 album of the same name.
