Today it was really impossible to find any spare time, thus this is more or less a desperation shot, made from the tripod at 3am. Technically it is no Saturday shot, but I guess I'll be lenient ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "The Flame Will Never Die" from the 1987 Beausoleil album "Bayou Boogie". Again no lyrics and no video. Amazon has a sound sample and YouTube has another song from the same album, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvXGJ8eP1B0" target="_blank">Zydeco gris gris</a>".
