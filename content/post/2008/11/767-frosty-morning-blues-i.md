Yes, I guess this will go on for some time now. This night it should have around or below zero centigrades. I don't know if I manage to get up, but I plan to deliver the next one in this series tomorrow morning.<br/><br/> It's interesting, there are only 12 days between this image and <a href="/2008/11/755-that-moment.html" target="_blank">another morning image</a> with almost identical composition, but it could be ages. I guess from late spring through summer we will see spectacular sunrises through this window. Let's hope this meadow and the field beyond stay open as long as I live here.<br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "Frosty Morning Blues" by the great Bessie Smith. I have it on disc 37 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", but you could also get it on "Bessie Smith: The Complete Recordings, Vol. 1". Ouch! There are five volumes in total! Hear the whole song on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/result/all/frosty%20morning%20blues" target="_blank">Deezer</a>. No lyrics though, sorry.
