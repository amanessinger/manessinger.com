It was the first day in a week that I had half an hour for photography. Great, huh? The car needed new winter tires, and at the garage I had to wait for half an hour. This is in the southern suburbs of Villach, an industrial and shopping area with remains of rural scenery intermingled. The place is only 50 meters away from a big hardware shop and from the car dealer, but it could as well be in the wilderness. <br/><br/> The Song of the Day is "The Waiting Game" from Roberta Flack's 1991 album "Set The Night To Music". No lyrics, no video, only a sound sample from Amazon.
