The original farm house still stands, and to its left there is a big new guest house. I don't know if the barn is still used, I suppose so, but I guess in only some years it will be a memory. Let's keep it from fading away.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/rolling-stones-not-fade-away-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Not Fade Away</a>" from the 1964 Rolling Stones album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Englands-Newest-Hitmakers-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006AW2P" target="_blank">England's Newest Hitmakers</a>". See them perform live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ8xM83fMhU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
