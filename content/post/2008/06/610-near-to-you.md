I only went out on the terrace and made some macro images of leaves, but that was OK. I was busy anyway, and I wouldn't have had time for hunting motives. The reason? See it this evening ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.actionext.com/names_n/nina_simone_lyrics/near_to_you.html" target="_blank">Near To You</a>" by the great Nina Simone. I have it on a fantastic sampler called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tomato-Collection-Nina-Simone/dp/B00006JNF3" target="_blank">The Tomato Collection</a>". Not the best thinkable quality overall, but what a collection of songs!
