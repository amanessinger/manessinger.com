If there is anything that this fisheye lens is great in, then it's looking around corners. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080603_082332.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080603_082332.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Basically we have two approaches here. In the first image the surroundings seemingly wrap around the street crossing. The place almost becomes a room.<br/><br/>For the second one, the Image of the Day, I actually stood nearer to the corner, keeping the other buildings out of sight, keeping them from wrapping the place. The result looks wider. Now repeat: to get something that looks wider, you have to go nearer. There may be logic to the fisheye, but it certainly is weird.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080603_081412.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080603_081412.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> One more thing: You may remember "<a href="/2008/05/594-warning-junk-ahead.html" target="_blank">594 - Warning: Junk Ahead</a>", the somewhat crappy first approach to all things fishy. Well, I finally think that this one, a variation taken this morning, is not junk any more. But what's more important: whereas Thursday's image took me half an hour of attempts and still was junk, this one was shot in less than a minute, and it only took me so long, because I needed three versions until I finally got my feet out of the image ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Photographing with this lens is fun again.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the old Blues standard "Meet Me Around The Corner" by Big Joe Williams. I have it on disc 46 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>". Sorry, no lyrics and certainly no video, but <a href="http://www.millisong.com/index.cfm/hurl/idzAlbum/IdAlbumz30372/30372.htm" target="_blank">here</a> is a sound sample.
