This fisheye lens gets controllable, the number of usable images rises again ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Well, not much more to tell, especially nothing book-related. I'm in a hurry. I've got to be off for work.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.sweetslyrics.com/530315.Stranglers%20-%20In%20The%20End%20.html" target="_blank">In The End</a>" from the 2002 Stranglers album "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coup-Grace-Stranglers/dp/B0000240YA" target="_blank">Coup De Grace</a>". Nobody seems to like this album, I do. Quite a different thing that this song wants to say, but it's beautiful and the title fits my needs. I take it anyway ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Hear it live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjMG2aOg2Ss" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
