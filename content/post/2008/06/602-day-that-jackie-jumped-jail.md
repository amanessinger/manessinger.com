This is the single image that I shot on Friday. I took it on my way to the train, just as I went up the escalator from the Underground. After the gloomy darkness below, I suddenly saw a blue sky and a flash of strong yellow. I did not think about it, I just raised the camera and, without any conscious effort, got this, just in the right split-second.<br/><br/>I combined three versions from one RAW file to cope with the enormous contrast, but otherwise I could have taken the original composition as shot. That I still cropped it, well, I saw the chance to get some lines int corners, and I simply couldn't resist. The original was not bad, but this one is even stronger.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/deacon-blue-ricky-ross-the-day-that-jackie-jumped-the-jail-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Day That Jackie Jumped The Jail</a>" from the 1991 Deacon Blue album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Hoodlums-Deacon-Blue/dp/B00002486J" target="_blank">Fellow Hoodlums</a>". See them live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDIl725iA_Y&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. The song is in the second part of the video.
