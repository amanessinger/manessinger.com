We had mixed weather so far, much rain lately, and work is a little bit over-represented in my life at the moment. I have stayed in Vienna for the weekend and will be off to work in some minutes.<br/><br/>Enough of the rant. I love these long days. I think one should spend all his life on the summer side of the planet. Although I leave work late, I always catch some daylight. This is the image of Friday, taken in Burggasse, in front of a former cinema. The light was blinding and I love the shadows and reflections on the ground.<br/><br/>Tonight I'll really have to go back to my normal schedule. It feels different when you post about an image that you have taken only hours ago. The emotions are much more present. I'll also have to write some words about creativity. Stay tuned. I'll try hard to be back in the evening.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/v/van+morrison/high+summer_20142947.html" target="_blank">High Summer</a>" from Van Morrison's 1999 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-Top-Van-Morrison/dp/B0010DJ1JC" target="_blank">Back on Top</a>"
