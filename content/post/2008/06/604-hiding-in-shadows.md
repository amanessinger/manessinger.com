I drove over to Keutschacher See, swam a little, and on the wayside, when I drove through a forest, I found this flower, hiding in the shadows. Basically the same recipe as yesterday. Apart from that I was editing SoFoBoMo images. Goodness, that's tedious.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Hiding In The Shadows" from the 1999 Peter Green Splinter Group album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Destiny-Peter-Green-Splinter-Group/dp/B000983WWQ" target="_blank">Destiny Road</a>". No lyrics needed, it's an instrumental ðŸ™‚
