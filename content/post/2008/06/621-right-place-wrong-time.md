Sorry guys, that's the wrong time. Up the trees again please, I'll tell you when you're due ðŸ™‚)<br/><br/>We have storms here in Vienna these days. Well, nothing that would overly impress our friends in the US, but for a mountainous country like ours they are pretty strong. This image is from Wednesday morning, I'm still a day behind schedule.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/dr-john-right-place-wrong-time-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Right Place Wrong Time</a>" from the incredible Dr. John's 1973 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Right-Place-Dr-John/dp/B000002I6Q" target="_blank">In the Right Place</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0F4jXhAca4&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
