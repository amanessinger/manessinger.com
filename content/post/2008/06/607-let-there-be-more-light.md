I had shot it at 8:11pm, when I just had left work. The image was badly lit, with a nice sky, but overall way too blue. It had some comic-like look, charming in a way, but still, I had already deleted it when I finally decided to take it back, load it in Photoshop and see if it has any potential. 14 layers later the Image of the Day is what I got. I like it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.pink-floyd-lyrics.com/html/let-be-light-saucerful-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Let There Be More Light</a>" from the 1969 Pink Floyd album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Saucerful-Secrets-Pink-Floyd/dp/B000002U9Y" target="_blank">A Saucerful of Secrets</a>".
