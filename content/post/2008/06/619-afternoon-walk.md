That's the abbreviation for "Motorfahrrad" or "motor bicycle". This is an old one and it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puch" target="_blank">Puch</a>. We had quite some of their bicycles so far (just check out my collection of <a href="/search/label/Bicycle" target="_blank">Bicycles</a>, a lot of them are Puch), but they have made motorbikes as well, some bigger, some like this one. I remember, when I was a child, the postmen used them. Well, that was at the end of the sixties, early seventies.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080623_173531.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080623_173531.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Monday afternoon was very hot and I slowly strolled home, taking one of the routes that I especially like on such hot lazy afternoons. It leads through one particularly sleepy part of Vienna's 8<sup>th</sup> district. <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080623_170305_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080623_170305_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> This is neither a historic region nor a shiny one, much of the architectural body is from the 1920s/30s, it seems to have been heavily bombed in WW2 and hastily mended in the fifties, but even that is now some time ago, and this part of the city has the charm of a place where people live but are quite not there. In fact that may well have been on that hot afternoon. I guess everybody but me was swimming ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080623_172908_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080623_172908_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Originally I had wanted to stay at work longer, but I was still tired from my late-night arrival from Carinthia, and instead decided to go home. For part of the walk I used the Sigma 70/2.8, for the other part the Sigma 30/1.4.  Both are among my favorite lenses.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080623_170516_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080623_170516_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Sometimes I wonder what people think when they see me standing or crouching there, and sometimes they even tell me. Just as I was taking an image of ivy on the garden side of a house (i've omitted it here), an old man came by and said "What are you photographing here? The ivy? <a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080623_172403_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080623_172403_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> But that's everywhere!". <br/><br/>He is right, and that's exactly the way most people run around. Ask them what they've seen, and you get a "Oh, nothing special". That's wrong. Everything is special around us, everything is unique, so are our lives, and if we fail to see and recognize it, then we fail to live at all.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Lazy Afternoon" from the fabulous Holly Cole's 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shade-Holly-Cole/dp/B00009VYNM" target="_blank">Shade</a>". Sorry, no lyrics, not even sound samples, Amazon does not like Holly or Holly does not like Amazon. I don't know. There is no video on YouTube either, but it's still the Song of the Day. You have to believe me ðŸ™‚
