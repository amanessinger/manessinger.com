Post-processing took some time and involved a selectively masked and overall subdued B&amp;W layer, some cloning and rather traditional burning. The result was not unlike yesterday's image, but in the end I've added a strong saturation layer that brought almost all color back. Still, a little bit of the B&amp;W character remains, and that's what I want.<br/><br/>Yesterday's image was really the result of a desparate experiment, but I feel that there is potential in this technique. I mean, selective B&amp;W is cheesy, you know, these bright blue eyes in othewise B&amp;W faces, but this is promising and you may see me walking that route once in a while.<br/><br/>The title? I have no idea, it just feels right ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I'm on the train right now and with only a limited selection of music, and apart from that I can only slightly remember a song that has the word "melancholia" in it, but probably not in the title. Therefore I have simply searched for something on Google, and I have found this: a video on YouTube, titled "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s8IQGDgaNY&feature=related" target="_blank">Melancholia</a>", and attributed to Led Zeppelin. No doubt, that is Led Zeppelin, I know the song, but they have nothing called Melancholia, I've checked the track listings for all their albums on Amazon. Googling for text fragments finally revealed that it is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ledzeppelin/sinceivebeenlovingyou.html" target="_blank">Since I've Been Loving You</a>". I have it on a 4 CD box set called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Led-Zeppelin/dp/B000002IQ1" target="_blank">Led Zeppelin</a>", but it is really from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Led-Zeppelin-III/dp/B000002J1U" target="_blank">Led Zeppelin III</a>". Well, whatever you choose, you can't go wrong.
