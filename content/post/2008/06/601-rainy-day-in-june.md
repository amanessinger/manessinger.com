Sometimes life is clutter, and to feel it, I have to let you dive in. Have you ever tried to photograph from under an umbrella, while walking in the rain? Well, that's how it feels ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/kinks-rainy-day-in-june-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Rainy Day in June</a>" from the classic 1966 Kinks album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Face-Kinks/dp/B0001XLXBQ" target="_blank">Face to Face</a>". If you don't have it, go for it. Hear the song on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=e5ZaBl7sElQ&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
