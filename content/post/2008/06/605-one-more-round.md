I'm a little bit behind my schedule, because yesterday evening I was too tired for anything, and today I spent hours visiting portfolios. You may have seen that <a href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/" target="_blank">Fine Art Photoblog</a> looks for one or two additional photographers. We had a total of 44 submissions, which is absolutely incredible, and at the moment we are busy casting our initial votes. This is not only a lot of work, it is painful as well. You simply have to narrow the selection down, and with so many quality portfolios it is not possible to do everybody justice. <a href="http://blog.epicedits.com/2008/05/19/fine-art-photoblog-opens-the-door-to-new-photographers/" target="_blank">See for yourself</a> (scroll down for the portfolio links). <br/><br/>As I said, at the moment we cast initial votes, five each, and the top-ranked portfolios will be discussed further. I'm sorry that this is such a lengthy process, but at the moment we are seven photographers on four continents and in six time zones. Communication can be challenging under these circumstances ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Yesterday saw no progress in book making, neither will there be today. I'll rather write another blog entry.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/bette-midler-one-more-round-lyrics.html" target="_blank">One More Round</a>" from Bette Midler's 1990 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Some-Peoples-Lives-Bette-Midler/dp/B000002IPS" target="_blank">Some People's Lives</a>".
