<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080617_204916_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2008/20080617_204916_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>It is only now and only slowly, that I find the time to enjoy some of the books that came out of <a href="http://www.sofobomo.org/projects.html" target="_blank">SoFoBoMo</a>. One that particularly inspires me because of its wonderful fresh look on details "in between", is Esther Emma Jongste's "<a href="http://issuu.com/estheremma/docs/sofobomo" target="_blank">Colorful Daily Details</a>". I'm loving it and it influences the way I see. Yesterday's telephone receiver (which is currently on <a href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/object/silence" target="_blank">Fine Art Photoblog</a>) came out of that, and in a way today's image as well. After two weeks of fisheye images I enjoy being back to small details.<br/><br/>It's early in the morning now, I was too tired to post yesterday. Work is tough at the moment. When I left, light was already failing. I probably should have asked two guys, who were practicing bicycle jumps, if I could take some images. I would even have had my flash with me, but after 11 hours of work I could not muster the energy. Pretty silly though. I guess I could have gone away with some first class action shots.<br/><br/>Anyway. I decided for the slow route, and on my way home I took a series of images of the usual things, cars, street corners, graffiti and such. This closeup image of a car back light is what I liked most.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-shiny-things-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Shiny Things</a>", again from the great Tom Waits' Opus Magnum "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Fold-out-Digipak-24-page-booklet/dp/B000L43AN4" target="_blank">Orphans</a>". Take the time and hear into the sound sample on Amazon's site. The only thing I've found on YouTube was an arrangement for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGRuJKdNikQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">ukulele</a>, but - hey, why not? It's a pretty little melody.<br/><br/><a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bill Birtch</a> and I are playing ping pong with these songs from Orphans, every once in a while he chooses one and then I do, but they are really that good. Oh, by the way, Bill has a pretty nice image of a <a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/2008/06/ride-roll-sitting-in-park-enjoying.html" target="_blank">bicycle over there</a>. You know, I love bicycles ðŸ™‚
