Well, we're still a day behind, this is only the image of yesterday, Tuesday, and I confess, I had my troubles with it. Originally I had taken it because of the shadow to the right, and I have several others of that, with or without feet. This was a vertical, and I really liked how the shadow went on. The problem was, that the big foreground, the feet and the direction in which the woman walks did not play together. Radically cropping from the bottom, almost to a square, finally did the trick.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once again from one of those generally disliked Stranglers albums. It's "In Heaven She Walks" from the 2002 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Written-Red-Stranglers/dp/B000024Z0O" target="_blank">Written in Red</a>". Sorry, no lyrics, but at least a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XokPzaWu8ak" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
