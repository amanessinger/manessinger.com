Sorry Ted, even I did not intend to do B&amp;W today. It just happened ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080628_091106_ps_bw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080628_091106_ps_bw.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The Image of the Day is from yesterday afternoon, and what attracted me were of course the reflections on the street. The other two images are from the morning, the first 50 meters from home, just in front of where I shot "<a href="/2008/06/622-stormy-weather.html" target="_blank">622 - Stormy Weather</a>". I had already posted it in a color version, but somehow I was not satisfied. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20080628_092407_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20080628_092407_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> When I did the second image, I also tried color, but there was not much to begin with, mainly shades of reddish earth tones, and so I tried B&amp;W. I frequently do that, just to see how it looks, and normally I revert to color, but in this case B&amp;W did well, because it emphasized the already abstract nature of the image.<br/><br/>Frequently I tone B&amp;W images, and most of the time I use the actions from <a href="http://epaperpress.com/psphoto/index.html" target="_blank">ePaperPress</a>. That's Tom Niemann's site, the guy who brought you <a href="http://epaperpress.com/ptlens/index.html" target="_blank">PTLens</a>. While PTLens is a commercial product (but the price tag of $15 is more or less symbolic for what this program does and how well it is supported), the Photoshop actions for toning are free. Try them, they are great.<br/><br/>As I said, normally I use these actions, lately I tend to tone myself with a Gradient Map layer over the B&amp;W conversion layer. I did so this time, and playing with colors and the gradient's mid-point brought exactly the tonality that I've had in mind. As a result, I copied these B&amp;W conversion layers to the other two images, adjusted tonality, but let the tone intact. There you have it. Three identically toned images, all shot with the Sigma 70/2.8, none originally intended for B&amp;W, all victim of my curiosity ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I really wanted to talk about creativity today, but, sorry, these images got in my way. I also wanted to post one more entry with my the images of today, but that won't work either. It's already past midnight, maybe I get two entries posted tomorrow. We'll see.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "It's OK to Listen to the Gray Voice" from Jan Garbarek's 1984 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-OK-Listen-Gray-Voice/dp/B0000031T6" target="_blank">album of the same name</a>. No lyrics, only saxophone ðŸ™‚
