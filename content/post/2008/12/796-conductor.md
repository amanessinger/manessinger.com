Well, it turned out better than I expected. I photographed this somewhat lively car this morning near our parliament.<br/><br/> There is no Song of the Day today, at least not in the strictest sense. But, just have a look at this video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d88xIIRDI9U" target="_blank">John Eliot Gardiner</a> conducting Mozart's "Requiem", then recall today's image. Hope it gives you a smile ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Btw: if yesterday we had a nice match of image and album cover, today is probably the worst in this regard. Still, of my recordings of Mozart's Requiem, this is probably one of the better. <br/><br/>Have you ever seen Gardiner conduct live? I had the pleasure three years ago. Beethoven, Symphonies nos 6 and 7. Quite remarkable and a fantastic unity of orchestra and conductor. It was almost spooky, like Gardiner pulling strings. <br/><br/>Remarkable, indeed.
