I mounted the Nikon 70-300 VR, went 30 meters from the house, positioned myself so that the tracks in the snow, the sign on the hardware store in the background and the building would properly align, and shot a series of images at f13.<br/><br/>Of course what came out of the camera completely lacked contrast and color. Photoshop did a good job though.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Cold Winter Blues" by Kokomo Arnold. I have it on disc 48 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", and you can also get it on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000000J37?ie=UTF8&tag=thedailphotof-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000000J37">Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 3 (1936-1937)</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedailphotof-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000000J37" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1"/>".<br/>Sorry, no lyrics, no video. It may not be a hit these days ðŸ™‚
