Indeed, both images were shot almost in passing, the Image of the Day in the morning while I hurried to the Underground, the other one in the evening while I hurried to an appointment.<br/><br/> Bicycles come so easy ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is a cover of the Robbie Robertson composition "<a href="http://theband.hiof.no/lyrics/the_weight.html" target="_blank">The Weight</a>". I could have taken Cassandra Wilson or any other fancy version, but I finally decided on the one from "The Last Waltz". Love that one.
