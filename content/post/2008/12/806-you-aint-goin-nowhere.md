I was out two times, both times by car, both times I expected to do some photographing, both times I did straight what I needed to do and then returned home.<br/><br/> But I tell you something: the apartment block in Villach has a basement with a garage (very convenient when it rains or snows), and there are ... bicycles! I would have been better advised to reset my camera from an exposure correction of -2EV, but probably even my brain was freezing. DxO nevertheless did a good job.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.seinberg.net/wordpress/" target="_blank">Seinberg</a> recently noticed the peculiar form of the head lights on so many of our bicycles here in Austria. Well, this is another one. Many of them are genuinely old, but the fact that people love this look, has caused them to be manufactured again.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is is related to what I did today: "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/you_aint_goin_nowhere.html" target="_blank">You Ain't Goin' Nowhere</a>" from "The Basement Tapes". Dylan and The Band. Always a good choice. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QrlDYQQFd4&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
