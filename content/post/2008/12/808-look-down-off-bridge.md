Well, yesterday I did ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081229_155111_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081229_155111_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> More and more often I rely on Google Maps for scouting photo locations. Sure, it does not give you the full picture, height information is missing, but if you are aproximately familiar with the environment, it's a fantastic way to find out how to get somewhere, because it will show you small roads that might even be missing from your maps.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081229_155641_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081229_155641_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> In case of yesterday's trip, from sight I knew that east of where the highway A23 crosses the river Tagliamento for the second time (counted from the North), there is <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=46.282309,13.090553&amp;spn=0.061454,0.107117&amp;t=h&amp;z=13" target="_blank">another bridge</a> over the river, and that was the place where I wanted to go. I intended to leave Villach at 2:15pm, but for various reasons I couldn't leave before 2:45.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081229_160043_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081229_160043_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Thanks to Google Maps I knew exactly where to go, and from the moment I left the highway at the exit Gemona/Osoppo at 3:30, it took me no more than ten minutes to get to the bridge, just in time for the sundown.<br/><br/> Basically I was there for an image looking east, over the river and to the gourgeous peaks of the Julian Alps. I had not expected to be able to get down to the river bed, and when I found out that there is indeed a way down, it was already too late. Anyway, that's for next time.<br/><br/>The bridge was narrow with two lanes and not much space for a photographer to stand, making changing lenses a rather awkward experience. I did it anyway, one more time using my Lowepro Slingshot (this time the 200) like a tray, dangling in front of me. It's a funny feeling juggling lenses over an abyss, but you get used to it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The images were shot with two lenses: the Nikon 18-200 VR, my travel lens, and the Sigma 10-20.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081229_161122_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081229_161122_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> I often read that those super zooms like my 18-200 (or Paul Lester's new <a href="http://www.paullesterphoto.com/wordpress/?p=2092" target="_blank">Tamron 18-270 VC</a>) are derided by prime snobs, and although I like to use primes a lot, while traveling I mostly stick to the 18-200, just because you never know what you need, and when you don't travel alone, permanently changing lenses makes your company even more nervous than the permanent stops do anyway.<br/><br/> Apart from that, both lenses, the Nikon 18-200 VR and the Sigma 10-20, are supported by DxO Optics Pro in combination with the D200 and D300, thus I get lens correction as well, not only of distortion, but also of CA and vignetting. Pretty nice, if you ask me. OK, in post-processing I put the vignette in again, normally much more so than there was in the first place, but there's nothing better than a clean start.<br/><br/>I concluded with some images into the sundown, and only half an hour after having arrived, I made my way back to Villach. A tad crazy the whole story, but absolutely satisfying ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "Look Down Off A Bridge", is from Jay Leonhart's 1983 album "Salamander Pie", a CD that has become famous because a German HiFi magazine used it as reference CD in their tests of high-end audio equipment during the early 1990s.<br/><br/>Indeed the CD is not only exceedingly well recorded, it is also a fine example of very relaxed bar jazz. Wonderful music to listen to, sipping on a glass of whiskey, but even without the whiskey it's very nice ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/jayleonhart6" target="_blank">CD Baby</a> has not only sound samples, they even let you hear the whole song, and at the moment they have the CD in stock.
