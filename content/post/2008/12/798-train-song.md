The choice of images was not exactly lush, I had five images of two subjects, one of each subject usable at all, one subject totally boring, well, that narrowed it down to - this.<br/><br/>Of course we had rain again, the sky in heavy clouds, everything wet, a lot of glare, and a polarizer might have helped ... a little. I was in a hurry, I did not use the polarizer, instead I used some Photoshop magic.<br/><br/>It is often said that the effect of a polarizer can't be replicated in Photoshop, and that's essentially true, but you can still do interesting things that are not that far away. One is using a "Hue/Saturation" layer in "Multiply" blending mode, blended into the light tones. Due to the nature of glare, this will mostly affect those reflections, that you would be trying to remove with a polarizer. It would darken those areas and strongly increase saturation, and that's really very similar to the effect of the polarizer. Add some masks to paint on, and you have a lot of control. And the fine thing with this kind of saturation layers is, that you can be sure they won't ruin your histogram. Of course I have an action that creates a group of these layers in various blending modes.<br/><br/> Speaking of Photoshop actions, my friend Brian Auer, founder of the <a href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/">Fine Art Photoblog</a>, runs another project on his main site Epic Edits. It's called "<a href="http://blog.epicedits.com/2008/12/08/project-action-and-preset-extravaganza/" target="_blank">Action and Preset Extravaganza</a>", and the idea is to put together a free collection of Photoshop actions and Lightroom presets. The result will be open source, and there is even something to win. Neil Cowley from <a href="http://makelightreal.com/" target="_blank">Make Light Real</a> will be sponsor and judge. How's that for an idea for the holidays? <br/><br/>The project runs until January 2. I guess I should polish some of my own actions and submit them, it'd be really about time ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>We already had Tom Waits' "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/tom-waits-train-song-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Train Song</a>" as Song of the Day in "<a href="/2007/02/133-working-mode.html" target="_blank">133 - Working Mode</a>", and then I already had refered to Holly Cole's cover version, but as a lot of Holly's songs recently have appeared on YouTube, I could not resist using it again. Holly Cole has recorded a whole album of Tom Waits covers ("Temptation"), but my favorite version of the "Train Song" is on the 1996 live album "It Happened One Night". See her perform on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk6-J4ZjywM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
