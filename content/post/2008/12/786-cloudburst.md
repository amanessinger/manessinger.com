A new cabinet and a door for another one had arrived and you know how assembling furniture takes time. This is one of only three humble images that I shot this morning through the window of my study. Having a camera where 300mm give you an equivalent of 450mm is not so bad after all ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> The mountain, Gerlitze, is one of the three mountains around Villach. <a href="/2008/11/768-river.html/2008/11/768-river.html" target="_blank">Mittagskogel</a> is for the looks, <a href="/search/label/Dobratsch" target="_blank">Dobratsch</a> for walking and enjoying a nature reserve, and Gerlitze is for skiing. As a mountain it is least attractive, but otherwise it has its charms.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/lambert-hendricks-and-ross-cloudburst-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Cloudburst</a>" from one of my all time favorite albums, "The Hottest New Group In Jazz" by Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross.
