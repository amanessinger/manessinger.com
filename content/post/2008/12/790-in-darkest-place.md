You can run simulations, but they never turn out like the real thing. Thus, when we already thought we were done and began to roll out the beast (it's a software distribution system in the large), all kinds of strange phenomena turned up, things that can only happen in the wild, and today was the worst in a week. I still have not fixed it, but at least I know now, what has caused the system to resonate and to hammer our oracle database with hundred thousand queries per minute. Actually pretty impressive that it survived ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> Anyway, back to photography. This is an image from my way home tonight. It's 1/30s at f4 and ISO 2200, underexposed by -1.7 EV, that means actually an equivalent of somewhere around ISO 6400. I could have used f1.4, but I really wanted some depth of field here. The image out of the camera did not look promising, Adobe Camera RAW did a bland job, and again DxO Optics Pro did it nicely, providing me with a nice, contrasty image without ugly noise, an image that I could build upon in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.uulyrics.com/music/elvis-costello-burt-bacharach/song-in-the-darkest-place/" target="_blank">In The Darkest Place</a>" from the 1998 album "Painted from Memory", a collaboration of Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach. Another nice song, still a nice album, but again no video found. The sound sample from Amazon may give you an impression though.
