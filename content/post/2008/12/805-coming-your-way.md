This is a road that I drove often in the past, and on sunny afternoons, the pattern of light and shadow never fails to impress me. It's even more pronounced in winter.<br/><br/> As for the Song of the Day, well, you certainly have been stumbling over the 10,000 hours rule lately and probably have seen the <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/video-gain-2008-gladwell" target="_blank">video of Malcolm Gladwell's speech</a> at the AIGA Business and Design Conference 2008 (if not, believe me, there are much worse ways to spend 39 minutes of your life), and you may remember that he argues with the career of Fleetwood Mac, and that it took them 16 albums of experimentation to finally reach fame. <br/><br/>That's right, it makes a fine point, but he still has it all wrong. "Then Play On", still with Peter Green, is the best Fleetwood Mac album ever, and the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/fleetwood_mac/coming_your_way.html" target="_blank">Coming Your Way</a>" from that very album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gCiayxPJAM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
