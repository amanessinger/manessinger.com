This is the second entry today, and I promise that it will be much shorter than <a href="/2008/12/792-let-it-snow-let-it-snow-let-it-snow.html" target="_blank">the last</a>.<br/><br/> Having done not much more today than post-processing yesterday's images, I was not inclined to try another expedition up the mountain, especially as the weather had not changed at all and there are not many places along the road where you can park your car. I expected to get more of the same, and I even thought about using one of yesterday's images for today. Of course my conscience won the battle and here we are with another image taken out of my study's window. Amazing, huh? <br/><br/>The strange sculpture is in the middle of a roundabout, and Santa Claus sells christmas trees. Idyllic, isn't it?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Cyndi_Lauper:In_The_Bleak_Midwinter" target="_blank">In The Bleak Midwinter</a>", taken from Cyndi Lauper's 2004 album "Merry Christmas Have a Nice Life".
