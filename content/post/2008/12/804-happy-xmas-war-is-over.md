What war? Well, there is always a war, isn't it? Wars do not just happen, they are made, and if we don't make them, they are over. War is over, if you want it.<br/><br/> This is probably not my most inspired image, but it's the best I could do, crouching on the balcony, peeping over snow that had freshly fallen while I was sleeping the afternoon away. You may know the lights in the background from <a href="/2008/12/799-imaginary-friend.html" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/john_lennon/happy_xmas_war_is_over.html" target="_blank">Happy Xmas (War Is Over)</a>", by John Lennon and Yoko Ono. I have it on the collection "Shaved Fish", along with much of Lennon's earlier solo work. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8jw-ifqwkM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
