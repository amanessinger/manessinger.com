They interfere with colors in a way that I don't like. I used the Sigma 50/1.4 today, this lens has a 77mm filter thread and my 77mm polarizer is a Hoya Pro 1 Digital, that's the slim, expensive type. I am not really sure, I'd have to make systematic tests and that's probably a stupid waste of time, but it's especially the Hoya filters that meddle with my colors. B&amp;W ever gave me that feeling.<br/><br/> What do I mean with "meddling with colors"? Well, it's probably a shift into magenta, or rather a draining of green and cyan. The images look pale, unsaturated. This is especially true with automatic white balance, thus I normally use "Cloudy". Underexposing helps as well.<br/><br/>As a result, post-processing this image was quite a challenge. I really had to reconstruct the colors, and I guess the final result is not too unnatural.<br/><br/>What about you? Do polarizers complicate the process for you? JPEG shooters, how do you do it? Any tricks?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/tori+amos/winter_20139495.html" target="_blank">Winter</a>" from the 1992 Tori Amos album "Little Earthquakes".
