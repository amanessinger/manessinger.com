It caused me to write a lengthy reply that I won't repeat here, go over to Juha's site to read it, but the more I think of it, the more it gets clear to me, that the simple act of repeatedly doing is, what eventually brings forth expertise.<br/><br/>I don't believe in the idea that a genius goes out, does what he never did before, and that it's good. Things don't work that way. <br/><br/> Well, probably sometimes they even do, but I firmly believe that there is always room for improvement, and this improvement comes from intimate familiarity with your subject.<br/><br/>Bicycles are a subject that I've got quite familiar with. They fascinate me for their simple geometry that nevertheless often forms the most poetic constellations of lines, ellipses and circles. In a way bicycles have become friends, and photographing them, I feel quite comfortable by now.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/v/vaya+con+dios/just+a+friend+of+mine_20225977.html" target="_blank">Just A Friend Of Mine</a>" from the 1987 Vaya Con Dios debut album.
