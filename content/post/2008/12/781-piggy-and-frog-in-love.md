That's the same shop that gave us "<a href="/2008/05/591-somebody-changed-lock-to-my-door.html" target="_blank">591 - Somebody Changed The Lock To My Door</a>". The Sigma 50/1.4 does not focus as close as a macro lens, but at f1.4, oh my, who would ask for more?<br/><br/>The obvious candidate for a Song of the Day was "Piggies" from the Beatles' "White Album", but I searched further on and found "<a href="http://www.uulyrics.com/music/elvis-costello-burt-bacharach/song-such-unlikely-lovers/" target="_blank">Such Unlikely Lovers</a>" from the 1998 album "Painted from Memory", a collaboration of Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach. Nice song, nice album, but sorry, no video found.
