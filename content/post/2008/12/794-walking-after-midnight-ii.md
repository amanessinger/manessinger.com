Let's keep this short.<br/><br/> This is a detail from a shop window that I saw today. I have no idea what they sell, but the miniatures fascinated me.<br/><br/>Just like <a href="/2008/12/788-walking-after-midnight.html" target="_blank">some days ago</a> the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bryan_adams/walking_after_midnight.html" target="_blank">Walking After Midnight</a>", but this time not by the Cowboy Junkies, this time it's Madeleine Peyroux on her 1996 album "Dreamland". I found it on Saturday, when by chance I stumbled into the local store of a media and electronics chain.<br/><br/>And now good night ðŸ™‚
