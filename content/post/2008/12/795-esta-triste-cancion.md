Late! I'm so late! Let's make this quick once again. Actually it's early in the morning and I should be on my way way to work ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081216_083809_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081216_083809_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> Do you ever forget resetting white balance? Monday I had used a custom white balance, something very cool, and when I made my first shot yesterday morning, an image of a chair and a plank that had been placed by a construction worker to reserve a parking lot, it came out with false colors - and I liked it.<br/><br/> The other image, the Image of the Day, is again a bicycle on the streets of Vienna, a very sad one this time. See the drooping head? Do we see tears? And what's the story behind? Maybe the answer is in the Song of the Day, a very sad song called "<a href="http://www.welt-musik.net/?p=149" target="_blank">La Pistola Y El Corazon</a>" from Los Lobos' stellar 1988 album of the same name. See them live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMOySSWPRN0&feature=related" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>Well, OK, OK, maybe it's a little contrived, but does this cover match nicely :-?
