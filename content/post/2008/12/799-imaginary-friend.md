Alas, in the evening he was already missing arms, and the next morning rain had reduced him to a small, indistinct heap of snow. Still, I'll remember this smile as something that went into my heart.<br/><br/>I can't see today's snowman from the bedroom, but whenever I look out of the living room, I see him, waving his arm, wishing me a good morning or a good night, and - call me sentimental, call me senile (I'd sure have, years ago) - I like this snowman. Sometimes I wave back and smile.<br/><br/>The image is an HDR from five bracketed exposures, shot from the tripod with the Nikon 70-300 VR (oops, I failed to de-activate VR, but it does not seem to matter with this lens), tone-mapped in Photomatix Pro 3.1, blended with the original middle exposure, and then some usual stuff applied.<br/><br/> Sometimes I'm asked with incredulity "What? You don't know the band XYZ??", and it's true, although they've produced mega-hits (is anything not mega today?), I may still have never heard of them. I don't hear radio, I almost don't look TV, I have no children, I don't read music magazines. Years ago you found me browsing the shelves of music stores, but now I mostly buy my music through Amazon. Most music stores have closed anyway, or if not, they have fired most of their staff, and now display just the "mega-hits" of the current "mega-stars".<br/><br/>It's just as well. If something is really good, I'll find it sooner or later. I found the Cowboy Junkies only 20 years after their inception via <a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/2008/11/working-on-building-managed-to-catch.html" target="_blank">Bill Birtch</a>, I find much by browsing lists and recommendations on Amazon, I find thing by chance, I get personal recommendations, don't worry, instead of drying up, I have to restrict myself to not browse too much.<br/><br/>Catatonia is such a band that I found by chance, browsing the shelves of a local media store. Today's Song of the Day "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/catatonia/imaginary_friend.html" target="_blank">Imaginary Friend</a>" is from their 2001 album "Paper Scissors Stone". I bought it when it was new, forgot about the band, and only now, while looking the album up on Amazon, I found that they already broke up. Well, at least they seem to have been quite productive in their time. <br/><br/>I found no video, but Deezer has the complete song on some "<a href="http://www.deezer.com/#music/album/91712" target="_blank">Platinum Collection</a>".
