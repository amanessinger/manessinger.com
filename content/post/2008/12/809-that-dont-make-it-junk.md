Recently I had begun to hear a strange noise under pretty exotic conditions: only in right bends, while driving steeply upwards, and only with someone sitting beside me. I had expected to get the car at around noon, and then to make another trip down to Italy, this time for the snow-capped mountains that made the backdrop for the last two days' images.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2008/20081230_102758_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2008/20081230_102758_ps.jpg" style="margin: 10pt 0px 10px 0pt; float: right;"/></a> It shouldn't come to pass. I only got the car back late in the afternoon, thus my photographic opportunities were limited to what I saw while walking home and then later back to the repair shop. On the other hand, that don't make it junk ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Image of the Day is an unusually tight crop of an image that I actually liked well, but that suffered from the bland, bright sky. I was already going to give it up, but then I tried kind of a desperation crop. Off went everything that was sky ... and I was startled. I had left less than four megapixels, but what I saw deeply satisfied me, more than all other images of today.<br/><br/> The second image is the whole structure from another angle, nearer now, more from below, and I like it as well. Here we are, let's see what tomorrow brings ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/thatdontmakeitjunk.html" target="_blank">That Don't Make It Junk</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 2001 album "Ten New Songs". <br/><br/>Well, sometimes I'm such a stupid idiot, I could bang my head against the wall for having missed the two concerts that he gave to standing ovations this autumn in Vienna. Fact is, I am on the mailing list of Vienna's Konzerthaus, I must have read the announcement half a year before, but somehow it didn't register. I only found out again when I read the raving critique of the first concert. Too late, so much too late. Oh well, here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-brh4fpsMA" target="_blank">video from Toronto</a>.
