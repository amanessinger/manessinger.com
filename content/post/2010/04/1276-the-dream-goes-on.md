Here are two more pictures from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmanova">Palmanova</a>. It'S Sunday, I am lazy and I won't go out photographing. Weather is not as bad as predicted, but I am tired and I owe you some more material about Palmanova anyway.

The probably best way to appreciate this city's plan is from the satellite image on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=de&geocode=&q=palmanova,+it&sll=48.208333,16.373056&sspn=1.663812,1.870422&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Palmanova+Udine,+Friaul-Julisch-Venetien,+Italien&ll=45.907211,13.311138&spn=0.013572,0.014613&t=h&z=16">Google Maps</a>. See what I mean with an "oversized" piazza? 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100410_153745_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100410_153745_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The first image was taken with the Nikon 24/2.8, an equivalent of 36mm, only slightly wide, and it gives you a good impression of what it feels like to stand there. See the green at the end of the street leading off the piazza on the otehr side? This is Contrada Savorgnan, leading not to one of the three gates, but instead to the now ovegrown ramparts. Mind you, this is a 24mm lens, cropped to a 36mm field of view. Nothing like the perspective shortening of a telephoto lens is present here, to the contrary. This is a small town, very small indeed.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/blondie/dreaming.html">Dreaming</a>" by Blondie. I always liked their music, it's inextricably connected to my youth. YouTube has a video from some TV show, seemingly playback, but the sound is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIjxGKLTADE">exactly like on record</a>. I recently bought a collection of Blondie songs as digital downloads. Recommended.
