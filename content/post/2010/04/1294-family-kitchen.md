Back to the Tammy. Hmm ... it's like it always is when I switch lenses. It's irritating. Nothing looks as it used to, especially after a 150/2.8. The wonderful thing with this Tamron lens though is, that you have so many options. At 50 mm and focused near it is almost a macro lens, at 17 mm it is pretty wide, with its stabilization it works wonders in low light, it is sharp, has a satisfying bokeh, really, I see no major weakness.

 I've experimented a lot today, there's not much that I deem worthy, but I certainly like the whimsical effect of the distortions in this image. B&W seemed just right for it.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/faithless/bring_my_family_back.html">Bring My Family Back</a>" from the 1999 Faithless album "Sunday 8pm". Oh dear, this is real good music. Guess I need more of them ðŸ™‚

YouTube has many versions of the song, I guess <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6_C6Faqjsk&feature=related">this is the album version</a>.
