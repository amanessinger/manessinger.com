It's Easter weekend. Here in Carinthia it's cold, compared to Vienna. Morning temperatures around freezing. It was beautiful today though.

Remember that I told you about the box of the now broken Tamron lens and that I have it in Carinthia? Well, that's right, it was here, and when I took it in my hands, I was surprised about its weight. Something had to be in it ...

Imagine my surprise when I found a lens inside. My good old Nikon 18-200 VR. It had had it on the camera when I bought the Tamron. Of course I had put the Tammy on the camera, the Nikon in the box - and there it had been for half a year. I had not even missed it. Boy, I have way too many lenses ðŸ™‚

 Today's image was taken using that very neglected lens, set to 200mm. The view is over the neighboring buildings towards Mount Mangart, a snow capped peak in the Julian Alps, directly on the border between Slovenia and Italy. I didn't even see the moon until I found it in Photoshop ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/irving_berlin/reaching_for_the_moon.html">Reaching for the Moon</a>" from the 2007 self-titled Holly Cole album. Wonderful rendition. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cf_5pL14I3o">YouTube</a>.
