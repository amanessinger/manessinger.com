Yesterday was warm a warm, beautiful Spring day. A little hazy, but I was not doing landscapes anyway. Today it rains, thus you'll get two Saturday images. Hope you don't mind.

 The first one in this post was taken in mid-afternoon in a park in Klagenfurt. I have used the Nikon 70-300 VR at 300 mm for the compression. I like those daisies. They remind me of the illustrations in a book of fairy tales that I had as a child. Now that I think of it, they were all spring pictures. Funny how images from childhood linger on, huh?

 The Song of the Day is "Primavera" from Cristina Branco's 2001 album "Post-Scriptum". Unfortunately I can't give you even a sound sample, thus I have to refer again to Mariza and her "Concerto em Lisboa". Different, but of course fine as well. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGnsz5bGtJY">YouTube</a> has it for you.
