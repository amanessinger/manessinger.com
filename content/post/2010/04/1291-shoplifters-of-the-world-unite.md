If you need something, without a doubt a shopping mall is a good place to go. Interestingly enough this holds true for Images of the Day ðŸ™‚

 When I arrived in Vienna I was in a hurry, and besides, the weather was real bad, which was a letdown after sunny Carinthia. It even drizzled slightly and I thought, well, the ultra-wide was perfect on Saturday in that shopping mall in Carinthia, why not try to pull the same stunt here?

 So I went there for shopping, in the hope to come back with food and a nice B&W image, but this time color won, and that's just another good point for not discarding color early.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/shoplifters_of_the_world_unite.html">Shoplifters Of The World Unite</a>", originally from the 1987 Smiths album "The World Won't Listen", but as that's not available for digital download in the US, I have also linked to "The Sound Of The Smiths", a collection of 45 songs including 15 out of 18 of "The World Won't Listen". 

The video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRbp0ZIehk0">YouTube</a> seems to be from some TV show: obvious playback and not even a halfhearted attempt to cover it. I have no idea how TV stations ever got away with that ðŸ™‚
