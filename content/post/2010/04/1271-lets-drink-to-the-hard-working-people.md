I am still in Carinthia. Our car needs an overhaul and I had to take a day off.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100406_081417_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100406_081417_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These two images were taken in the morning when I walked back home. At the moment I use the Nikon 18-200 VR, and it really has its advantages to have such a big range. Chromatic abberations can be quite high (depends upon focal length) and the distortions are very high as well, but both can be corrected in software. 

 Actually I'm quite satisfied. It's not a killer lens, it's not a lens I would buy again, but having it does not hurt at all ðŸ™‚

It's mid-afternoon, I'll go fetch the car in a few minutes. The day has turned from overcast/hazy to wonderfully sunny, so I may make some more images, but I really want to get this post done. I'll have to work on my <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">Programming</a> blog in the evening on the train ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is of course "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/salt_of_the_earth.html">Salt Of The Earth</a>", the last song on the 1968 release "Beggars Banquet", maybe the best Rolling Stones album ever. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQjB9Dvdn20">YouTube</a>.
