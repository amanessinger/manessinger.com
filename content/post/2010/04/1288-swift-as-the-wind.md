This morning I found a twig with blossoms in front of a lamp outside a shop. Everything was moving in the wind. Not much, but these blossoms are pretty small and I had to come very near with my Sigma 150/2.8. It took me about 50 exposures until I had one with the desired framing and the sharpness where I wanted it.

Apart from that, I called my camera dealer, innquiring about the Tammy. It is in repair and it's suppose to be back by mid-week. I don't miss it that much on the streets of Vienna, but it is incredibly handy on weekends. After all, weekend trips, that's what I bought it for in the first place. Anyway. I'll await it ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/incredible_string_band/swift_as_the_wind.html">Swift As The Wind</a>" from the 1968 Incredible String Band album "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter". This was the first ISB album that I ever heard and bought and it's still one of my favorites. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmI0AAoFT5Q">YouTube</a>.
