The rain lasted all through Thursday. I had decided that the Sigma 70/2.8 was not the ideal lens for that gloom, thus I switched to the Sigma 50/1.4.

 Of course 50 is not so much different from 70, I use this lens at a minimum of 1/60s, but 1.4 makes a big difference. Two full stops. You only have to use it wide open, or else you won't profit at all.

 In the end I took my images at daylight, and that gave me the option to use f4, a more suitable choice, because I needed at least some depth of field.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/irving_berlin/isnt_this_a_lovely_day_to_be_caught_in_the_rain.html">Isn't This A Lovely Day (To Be Caught In The Rain)</a>", written by Irving Berlin. I have the version on Ella Fitzgerald's "Irving Berlin Songbook", but looking on YouTube I only found another one by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5-yJjS3wuY">Ella and Louis</a>.  Well, "only" is probably a little bit too harsh ðŸ™‚
