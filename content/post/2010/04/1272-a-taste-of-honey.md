Oh yes, it's Spring again, it's warm again, and I'm out there with my Nikon 70-300 VR again. It feels much like last year, when I did most of my SoFoBoMo effort with this lens.

I's Thursday evening, already very late, and although I only wanted to make two images, one for yesterday, one for today, I ended up with three each.

At an effective focal range between 105 and 450 mm, I see pictures everywhere. It's completely impossible to escape. Not that I wanted to ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "A Taste Of Honey" from the 2002 album "Baciamo le Mani" by Roy Paci &amp; Aretuska. It's not available via Amazon.com, but Amazon.de has it via some Marketplace dealers, and if you're fast, someone in Turkey sells it on <a target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ROY-PACI-ARETUSKA-BACIAMO-LE-MANI-CD-2001-NEW_W0QQitemZ350296296846QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_CDsDVDs_CDs_CDs_GL?hash=item518f494d8e">eBay</a>. And of course it's on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me3nzxH3VBg">YouTube</a> ðŸ™‚
