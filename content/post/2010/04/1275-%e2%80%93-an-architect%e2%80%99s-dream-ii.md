We've been to <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmanova">Palmanova</a> yesterday. That's a small town south of Udine, just where the highway coming from Austria, the A23, meets the highway A4, Trieste - Venice.

It was built from 1593 as an ideal city - which mostly meant ideally suited for war. It's a gigantic fortress in the shape of a nine-pointed star, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, and in the middel there is a completely oversized piazza, circular, with the cathedral on one side.

Palmanova is a nice place to visit, sit in the sun, sip a drink and watch people. At least that's what we did 🙂

 The Song of the Day is once more “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/an_architects_dream.html">An Architect’s Dream</a>” from Kate Bush’s 2005 album “Aerial”. I used the title a year ago for "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/05/950-architects-dream.html">950 – An Architect’s Dream</a>". Hear the Song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTQuXr0pDuw">YouTube</a>.
