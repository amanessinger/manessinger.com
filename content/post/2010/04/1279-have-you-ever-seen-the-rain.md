I had evening dates for two consecutive days, returned late and got nothing done.

This is the Wednesday image, part of a fountain in front of Austria's Parliament. I used the Sigma 70/2.8 at that day. It's not stabilized and I don't use it below 1/100s, thus I had to look for well-lit things. Oh how I miss my Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC! It's not only stabilization, it's the useful range as well. 

 The Song of the Day is the old CCR hit "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/creedence_clearwater_revival/have_you_ever_seen_the_rain.html">Have You Ever Seen The Rain?</a>", this time from the soundtrack to "Philadelphia", interpreted by The Spin Doctors. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czO3IbObt4">YouTube</a> has it.
