It's bicycle day again. I had four or five of them, here's the best, a classic poser if I ever saw one ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is one more time from the 2000 Eric Clapton / B. B. King album "Riding With The King". Oh my dear, what an image! Not mine, the cover image ðŸ™‚

Today the Song is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bb_king_eric_clapton/days_of_old.html">Days Of Old</a>" and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsrWLyJQkoM">YouTube</a> has it.
