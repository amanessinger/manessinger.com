As I said in the morning, it was mostl ycloudy today, it only got better in mid-afternoon, when even some sun came out.

It didn't bother me at all, because I had to work on the tutorial for the <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">Programming</a> blog anyway.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100405_160739_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100405_160739_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In fact, most of the time I was held up with CSS. The matter is, when you do kind of a technical documentation, you very often refer to places in the user interface of the tool (like I might say "From the context menu use <em>New Class</em>"), you explain important terms, and you refer to things a user has to type in or the system prints out. You also want to structure your post into sections, subsections and maybe sus-subsections. It does not happen that often on this blog, but I had to find a solution for the tutorial on the other blog. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100405_162328_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100405_162328_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This is the kind of text that I will write very often, and I really want to use structural markup for that. Thus instead of using italics and bold fonts or such things (that's visual markup), I instead use a span with a class "term" for terms, a class "gui" for user interface objects, etc. This way I can use a CSS stylesheet attached to the whole blog, and when I ever change my design, all occurrences of terms and references to user interface elements get changed together. 

That tutorial is something that I write at work as well, and at work I use our Wiki. That's the same software that runs Wikipedia, and I only realized today, how much easier it is to write documentation, when you're not forced to plain HTML.

I could set up a Wiki of course, and maybe it would be even a better resource than a blog, but blogging is what I want, thus I maybe have no choice but using that verbose HTML/CSS crud.

 Today's three images were taken on a short afternoon outing, all within 100 meters of each other.
