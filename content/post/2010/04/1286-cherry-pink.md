It's two weeks now that I brought my broken 17-50/2.8 VC back to the shop and they sent it in to Tamron. No news yet.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100421_082523_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100421_082523_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> On the other hand, not having this incredibly versatile lens has an advantage: I began using my other lenses again.

Today for instance I used the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro, a lens that I rarely use, but when I do, I thoroughly enjoy the experience.

It's a big lens, a heavy lens, but it feels good on the camera and it's really a fantastic lens. All three images here were taken at f2.8, and wide open this lens is really critically sharp. You won't be able to appreciate it fully at web sizes, but especially the image with the vines on the wall is razor-sharp.

 The Song of the Day is "Cherry Pink", aka "Gummy Mambo" or, in the version of Austrian brass superstars Mnozil Brass, "Gummimambo". It's from their 2004 album "Wenn der Kaiser grooved" and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxFwJxlAGW8&feature=related">YouTube has it</a>.
