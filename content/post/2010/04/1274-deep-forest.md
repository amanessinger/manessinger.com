Oh my, how many things I wanted to do today, and now? I slept almost the whole train ride, I arrived late, had dinner, did some administrative things, and now it's midnight ðŸ™‚

 But then, I was so satisfied with yesterday's "dancers", I guess we can tolerate a mediocre train station image today, can we?

The Song of the Day is "Deep Forest" by Earl "Fatha" Hines. I have it on disc 77 and disc 136 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", this fantastic treasure trove of 168 CDs full of classic Jazz. I got it for 99â‚¬ some years ago, and now I see it from an Amazon Marketplace dealer for $159.95. Still a killer price at less than $1 per CD. Only one left though ðŸ™‚

Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0XWK7dyRr0">YouTube</a>.
