This morning I was surprised. It had obviously rained through the night and so the streets were wet.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100402_082712_photomatix_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100402_082712_photomatix_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The sky was not yet clear, it was very hazy, but at the same time the overall impression was one of light. The first image, an HDR may give you a feeling for what I mean.

This is another one of these tripod-less HDRs, and Photomatix Pro has done a marvelous job eliminating a person crossing the street in the background.

 The second image, well, it's just one of these texts out of context.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/whitney_houston/i_go_to_the_rock.html">I Go To The Rock</a>" from the soundtrack to "The Preacher's Wife", sung by Whitney Houston. Damn fine gospel, and the Georgia Mass Choir does no harm either. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev5_qIoeDrw">YouTube</a>.
