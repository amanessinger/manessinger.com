As promised, instead of a rainy Sunday image, here's another one of yesterday's spring impressions, this time from a square in Villach where we had breakfast in the sun.

Again this has been taken with the Nikon 70-300 VR at 300 mm, only this time at minimum focus distance, and that always make for a good blur, even at f5.6.

 The Song of the Day is "A Andorinha Da Primavera" from Madredeus' wonderful 1997 album "O ParaÃ­so: 14 CanÃ§Ãµes". No swallows in this image though ðŸ™‚
