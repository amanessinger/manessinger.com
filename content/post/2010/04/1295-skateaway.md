Just a morning image. More Photoshop than anything else, but what can I do, it's Friday ðŸ™‚

 I needed to be at work early and therefore took the tramway, but then it had a problem with a door that did not close, and instead of waiting on the train, I went the rest of the way.

At the moment I'm on the train, trying to get this post done, in order to begin working on my JEE6 cookbook again. Oh dear, Andreas, I tell you, this is not a job, this is a hobby ðŸ™‚

 Last night <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 10.04 came out, today I have it already running in a VirtualBox on my laptop. Well, actually it's Xubuntu, the XFCE variant. Small, lean, elegant, works like a charm. And if you've no idea what I'm talking about, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">why not</a> have a look?

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dire_straits/skateaway.html">Skateaway</a>" from the 1981 Dire Straits album "Making Movies". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcwl-Q7pAtY">YouTube</a>.
