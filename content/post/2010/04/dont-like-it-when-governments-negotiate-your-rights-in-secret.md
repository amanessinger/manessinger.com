And now a short break from photography:

<strong><span style="color:red">ACTA</span></strong> is a controversial international treaty that impacts digital rights and is being negotiated in secret meetings. <a target="_blank" href="http://publicacta.org.nz/">PublicACTA</a> has been organised by InternetNZ so that the public can critique the known and likely content of <strong><span style="color:red">ACTA</span></strong> proposals ahead of the next round in Wellington, NZ. 

PublicACTA has prepared the "<a target="_blank" href="http://publicacta.org.nz/wellington-declaration/">Wellington Declaration</a>". Its purpose is to preserve the Internet as a place for creativity and innovation, for the sharing of knowledge, citizen engagement and democracy, and as an engine of economic growth and opportunity. The <strong><span style="color:red">ACTA</span></strong> treaty, as its contents has leaked so far, is a severe danger to all those beneficial aspects of the Internet.

<blockquote>Please consider strongly signing PublicACTA's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gopetition.com/online/35443.html">petition</a>. It is in your interest, in that of your children and in that of all citizens of our global community.</blockquote>

Please sign and please pass on the word.
