Well, actually I'm not. I finally have my Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC back. Tamron repaired it under warranty. Pretty nice, I'd say. 

I've tried it out, everything works as it used to and as it should. Focus is precise, stabilization is excellent, sharpness is outstanding. No problems at all.

If you came here because I've tagged this post as part of my <a target="_blank" href="/tag/tamron-17-502-8-vc-review">Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC Review</a>, well, that's pretty much everything I have to say today. I just remember having reported the damage in one of the review posts, thus I think I have to report the outcome as well.

Of course the actual image was not made with the Tamron but with the Sigma 150/2.8 Macro.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricstime.com/rolling-stones-i-am-waiting-lyrics.html">I Am Waiting</a>" from the 1966 Rolling Stones album "Aftermath". I have the UK version, the original version, I might say, thus I link to that. Hear the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02rHc9O94BM&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
