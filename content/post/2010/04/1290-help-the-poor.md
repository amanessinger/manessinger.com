The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bb_king/help_the_poor.html">Help The Poor</a>" from the 2000 B. B. King / Eric Clapton cooperation "Riding With The King". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o96V9f1YnaI">YouTube</a>.
