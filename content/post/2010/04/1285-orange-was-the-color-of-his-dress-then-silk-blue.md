One more image for today. I was pretty out of luck in the morning. Being late and in a hurry I tried my best, took a lot of images, to no avail.

 In the end I resorted to another bicycle with a fancy dress.

The Song of the Day is "Orange Was The Color Of Her Dress, Then Silk Blue" from the 1975 album "Changes Two" by Charles Mingus. YouTube does not have the real thing, but what they have, a version by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91lODxllQY0&feature=related">Swedish Mingus Band</a>, is very good and true to the original.
