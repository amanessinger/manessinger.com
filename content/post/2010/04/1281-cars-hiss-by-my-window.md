The Sigma is a cream machine. I say it all the time: this is the best 50/1.4 you can get for Nikon cameras. Small wonder, it's big, heavy and more expensive than the Nikon 50/1.4G.

 This is an image, straight from the camera, taken this morning in one of those few old-fashioned tramway trains on Vienna's line #5. Normally you can't open windows, here you still can ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/doors/cars_hiss_by_my_window.html">Cars Hiss By My Window</a>" (quite literally ðŸ™‚) from the 1971 Doors classic "L.A. Woman". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgHDfXB8LXU">YouTube</a> has it.
