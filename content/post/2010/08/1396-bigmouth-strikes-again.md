These are the last images with my D300. It's gone. I mean not really gone, not that gone, but well, gone nevertheless, at least for a week or two.

Remember that cursed Tamron 17-50/2.8, this sweet lens that works so well, at least as long as it works? Remember that I sent it in for service, because it increasingly often failed to stop down upon exposure, resulting in terribly overexposed images? Well, the Tamron service insists on having the body to match the lens to. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100810_081332_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100810_081332_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's a tad stupid, because if I upgrade to a D400 in a year, I simply expect my lenses to work. 

Anyway, that's how it is, today I sent the D300 in, and for the next one or two weeks I will be using my old D200.

 The Song of the Day is one of the biggest hits of The Smiths, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/bigmouth_strikes_again.html">Bigmouth Strikes Again</a>", originally from their album "The World Won't Listen", but as that is not available as digital downloads, and as "The Sound Of The Smiths" contains pretty much everything from that album plus much more, I am going to recommend the collection. YouTube has many live versions as well, but here is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYLmptz_r_o">the original</a>.
