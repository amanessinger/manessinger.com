It's still supposed to be Summer, only it ain't. People here in Vienna wear autumn clothing, which I refuse to do, but at the moment, while I sit in my living room, writing this post, my heating is turned on. This is a first for this season, and I feel comfortably warm, while outside the winds are howling.

 The image that you see here was made with the new Nikon AI-S 24/2.8, and it was taken from under an umbrella. I guess I was not the only one who felt uncomfortable ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "That's How I Feel Today" from The Little Chocolate Dandies. You find the song on many compilations, depending on the member of the band you look for. Among others that includes Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter and Fats Waller. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_jw404ltI4">version from 1929</a>.
