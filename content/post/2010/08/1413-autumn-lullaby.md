Friday was a hot day in Villach, although the sky was overcast when I strolled through town. It didn't feel like Summer though, and the signs of Summer's end are everywhere.

 I still use the Nikon 50/1.2 and I have found some perverse liking for the slow process of focusing that beast. Actually I enjoy it so much, that I'm going to buy an AI/S 24/2.8 Nikkor as soon as I am back to Vienna on Monday. It's a bit crazy, given that I have an AF 24/2.8 Nikkor and that lens can of course be focused manually as well, but I am after that feeling that only these old Nikkors have. Oh well!

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/children/autumn_lullaby.html">Autumn Lullaby</a>" from Natalie Merchant's spectacular new album of childhood poetry set to music, "Leave Your Sleep". I have not found it on YouTube, but on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nataliemerchant.com/l/leave-your-sleep/autumn-lullaby">Natalie's site</a> you can listen to long excerpts of the songs, and once you've done that, you're likely to buy the album anyway ðŸ˜„
