Here's a Friday image. Friday 13<sup>th</sup> it was, but nothing bad has happened ðŸ™‚

 I was more concerned with programming than with photography, it shows, but I can't help it. It's just the way it is. Still, it's better than Saturday and Sunday, because I have no image for them at all ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Train Fare Home" by Muddy Waters. It's on many collections, "His Best 1947 To 1956" is one of them, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2k2nKPnq_s">YouTube</a> has the song as well.
