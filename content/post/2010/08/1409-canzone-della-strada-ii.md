Again I had precious little time yesterday, with no photographic results worth mentioning. It may even go on like that for a few days. 

 Here's another image from Italy, taken in beautiful Camogli. For lack of time and a better name, the Song of the Day is again "Canzone Della Strada" from the 2004 album of the same name by Quadro Nuevo. Here's it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQf_HW3l4eA">YouTube</a>, and they have other pieces from the same album as well.
