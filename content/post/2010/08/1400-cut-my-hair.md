This is Tonto, our poor little cat. When we went to Villach, we had to leave him behind. Well, regardless of how much you love a cat, you can't take him from a house with garden and a forest behind, to an apartment in a city. Not after 13 years.

Well, he's 15 years now, and a month ago his hair was so matted, that he had been given a close shave. Even after a month he still looks much like a poodle. We were there because we had to bring him to the doctor for a vaccination refreshment.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/who/cut_my_hair.html">Cut My Hair</a>" by The Who and from the soundtrack to Quadrophenia. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_V4GLevv6w">YouTube</a> has it.
