Though I made some images today, there was nothing that I'd prefer over this second image of yesterday's trip. It's exactly the same place, a slightly different point of view.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lynyrd_skynyrd/one_more_time.html">One More Time</a>" from the 1977 Lynyrd Skynyrd album "Street Survivors". Cover and title of the album have a slightly morbid taste, taking into account that three days after the album's release three people on that cover had died in a plane crash, and most of the others were severely injured. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVfru-XlR6g">YouTube</a> has the song.
