You may ask yourself, now that SoFoBoMo is over, what about his book? And really, I have not done much lately, I believe I have processed only two images from Italy this week. It's a tad dense at the moment, but I have definitely not given up. It will only take longer than expected. I guess that's normal for a computer programmer like me ðŸ™‚

 At least I can say that I have enough images. I have close to 100 candidates, and close to 40 images that most likely will end up in the book. Sure, it's not SoFoBoMo any more, so I could ignore the "minimum of 35 images" rule, but I prefer to stick to the original plan. Thus, you'll get it, it will only be some other time not too far in the future.
