Here's one last image taken yesterday. After swimming I made a detour home. Another one of those small roads. This time I knew the road, but I had never been in that quarry.

 The Song of the Day is "The Tale Of The Giant Stone Eater" from The Sensational Alex Harvey Band's 1975 album "Tomorrow Belongs to Me". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXHnge0Bq4o">YouTube</a> has it for you.
