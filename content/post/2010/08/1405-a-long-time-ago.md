I can't say that I'm very interested in modern, flawless, untainted architecture, but you can get me anytime with a little decay. Why? Inorganic things somehow get organic when they age. By falling apart, the lifeless begins to breath life. Funny, huh?

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/a_long_time_ago.html">A Long Time Ago</a>" from David Byrne's 1994 self-titled album. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oqPvEG73hQ">YouTube</a> has a video for you.
