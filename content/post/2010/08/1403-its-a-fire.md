Oh dear, a sunrise! How could I?

But then, why not? Sure, it's a clichÃ©, with probably only sundowns being worse, but it has happened, it did impress me, and I have the feeling that the image is quite a good representation of what I saw.

It's likely the better image, but, damn, that sunrise was really great ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/portishead/its_a_fire.html">It's A Fire</a>" from the 1994 Portishead album "Dummy". Nice song. Head over to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y26KpgZknY">YouTube</a> for it.
