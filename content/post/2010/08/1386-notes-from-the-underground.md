I like to take small roads that I don't know, like to see where they take me. On Saturday one of them has taken me to this place where the highway crosses the railway. Actually, now that it's Sunday evening, now that I am on the train back to Vienna, I must have come through that place just minutes ago. I noticed too late though.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/manhattan_transfer/notes_from_the_underground_antes_que_seja_tarde.html">Notes From The Underground</a>" from the 1987 Manhattan Transfer album "Brasil". YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixKaxwt-2YM">live performance</a>, and to judge from their looks, it must be from about that time.
