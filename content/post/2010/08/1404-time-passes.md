OK, this is a strange format for a post, but it's a strange format for an image as well ðŸ˜‰

Yesterday morning I took the tram for work. It was one of those old trains that I sometimes take images of, and while I was in there and wondered at which station to get out, I took some images from the same position. Some were not sharp, but some were, and they were easily aligned in Photoshop. At first I wanted to do some trick with masks, but when I tried simply arranging them vertically, I liked the result.

I stayed at work until 8pm and, regardless of the temperatures, had this winter feeling while walking home ðŸ™‚
