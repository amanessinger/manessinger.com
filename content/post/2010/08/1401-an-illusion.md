Today is Sunday, and for today I really have no image at all. Let me show you one more image from Italy instead.

 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompe_d'oil">Trompe-l'Å“il</a> murals are very common in Liguria, and while most of the time they only give the illusion of a more elaborate facade than there actually is, sometimes it goes far beyond that. This is such an example from near Sestri Levante.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/stiltskin/an_illusion.html">An Illusion</a>" from the 1995 Stiltskin album "Mind's Eye". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlY8CAuzTeY">YouTube</a>.
