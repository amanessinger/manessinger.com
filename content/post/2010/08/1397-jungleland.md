Do I miss my D300? Sure. It's faster than the D200, where preview is painfully slow. It has a bigger and better display and it has more dynamic range. All true.

And the images? They are different too, at least the JPEGs, but that's something I don't care about.

 In the end my images get created as much in Photoshop as in the camera. Take this one. Colors were vastly different from what the D300 would have produced, and the tone curve has changed completely. In reality it makes makes no difference though. At any time I have a certain feeling of how my images should look like, and that's what I make them look like, regardless of the camera used.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/jungleland.html">Jungleland</a>" from Bruce Springsteen's 1975 album "Born To Run". YouTube has a fine 1978 live version, ripped from an old <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH_NvYPBDY0">B&amp;W video</a> tape that has been played much too often, complete with thin, hissing audio, but you won't mind. Believe me, you won't mind ðŸ˜„
