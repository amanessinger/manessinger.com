Just a street scene that I saw today. Sorry that I'm not in the mood to elaborate further. It's after midnight and I am really, really tired ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_nutini/high_hopes.html">High Hopes</a>" by young Scotsman Paolo Nutini. It's from his 2006 album "Sunny Side Up". YouTube has a nice <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5DOSzcw67s">live video</a>. And while you're at it, why not hear <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkyWxMPdusA&feature=related">some more songs </a>from this fabulous album?
