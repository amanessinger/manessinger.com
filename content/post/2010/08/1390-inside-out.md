I just spent an insane amount of time listening to Lawrence Lessig speaking about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lessig.org/content/av/">rebooting democracy</a>. It's about the US democracy, but what's wrong in the US is pretty wrong over here as well. Interesting stuff, he has different videos, the shortest "of / by / 4 in 18 minutes", the longer about that subject running for around an hour. Very recommendable if you have some time to burn, and of course I am always fascinated by his brilliant way of using slides. I'm pretty sure he has no patent on it, maybe I should try something like that at work ðŸ™‚

 The image of the day, well, there was a car with a big tin tube on its roof rack, and being a nosy guy, I wanted to find out what it would look like to be inside. Well, that's what it looks like ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Inside Out" from Shara Nelson's excellent but widely unknown album "What Silence Knows". Unfortunately this is her only album. She's probably best known for her work with Massive Attack, she has appeared as collaborator/guest on a number of albums, but I still wait for a sequel to her own. YouTube has an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoE-qju6iGQ">orchestral version</a> of this song that I didn't know. The voice track is straight from the album, but the orchestra is a cool alternative.
