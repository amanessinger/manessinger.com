This is the image for Friday, obviously not made on Friday. It's Rapallo in Liguria, Italy again. I like Rapallo, because it is big enough to have a population not working in the tourism industries.

We are in the process of searching for a a more permanent abode in Villach, and I arrived one day earlier, because we had a meeting with a very competent woman from the construction company. We are looking for an apartment, but of course nothing fits just right. Thus we spent three hours in front of AutoCAD, and now we are quite confident.

 The Song of the Day is "Canzone Della Strada" from the 2004 Quadro Nuevo album of the same name. YouTube has it, I suggest you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQf_HW3l4eA">give it a try</a>. Quadro Nuevo are an Austrian band, but this feels real Italian. More than real I might say ðŸ™‚
