So <a href="http://landscapist.squarespace.com/journal/2010/8/25/civilized-ku-647-ball-o-bikes.html">The Bike Photographer</a> strikes again ðŸ™‚ 

 I guess this was the last image with the Nikon AI-S 50/1.2 for a few days. I actually did it, I bought a Nikon AI 24/2.8 for â‚¬160. This is quite a good price, especially considering that it came with a hood. Unfortunately the weather here is unpleasantly wet and cold, completely untypical for this season, and this takes a bit of the joy out of photography.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/x/xavier_naidoo/id_be_waiting.html">I'd Be Waiting</a>" by Xavier Naidoo. See the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUqniRhfq4I">YouTube</a>.
