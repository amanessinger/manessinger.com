Summer is not over yet, but it's grown old - and if you look closely, carefully, you can already see it dying. It's the way things are, it's the way we are, it's the way things go, and eventually we'll go like that.

And there's a longing to hold on to it, hold on to whom we love, and cannot let go, and eventually must let go - or be gone.

 You expected Cohen, did you? Nope. The Song of the Day is "The Longing" from the 2009 Eels album "Hombre Lobo". YouTube has a version obviously <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw6Sx9w5SEo">recorded in some radio station's studio</a>.
