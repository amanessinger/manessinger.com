OK, this is the last post for tonight, promised ðŸ™‚

This is an image taken today, again with the 50/1.2. The butterfly was friendly anough to give me time to focus.

 Btw, speaking of butterflies, don't you feel that this is a funny name for an insect? But what is more funny, is that the names for butterflies in different languages are completely unrelated. Normally you see the same stem used in the romanic languages, sometimes English agrees with German, sometimes with French, but here it is all totally different: butterfly, mariposa, farfalla, papillon, Schmetterling. It's rare that you see something like that. It is almost as if butterflies had suddenly appeared maybe a thousand years ago, when the peoples in Europe had already settled ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jason_mraz/butterfly.html">Butterfly</a>" from Jason Mraz's 2008 album "We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.". Great album, great singer, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIuGN7KtY-M">YouTube</a> has the song.
