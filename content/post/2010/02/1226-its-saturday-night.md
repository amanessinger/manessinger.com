Hard to come up with a good image when you have none, huh? Well, this weekend I am in Vienna to help Michael with his apartment. Yup, still things to be done. In fact I've had no time to take photos all day, and when I went home at night, I was not overly inspired either. Let's all just ignore this image, can we? I wouldn't have thought it, but it's the antithesis to my long-standing conviction that there is a good square in every bad image. I have to get out and to Michael's again, I can't afford to search any longer. Here's a crop that's not worse than any other ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/proclaimers/its_saturday_night.html">It's Saturday Night</a>" from the 1988 Proclaimers album "Sunshine on Leith". They were a two album band from Scotland, probably not well known in the US, but both of their albums were real good and this one was even real, real good ðŸ™‚

I can only direct you to Amazon's sound sample, but just to not leave you without a video, let me recommend "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM0sTNtWDiI">I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)</a>" from the same album.
