Behold! You look at one of the three images that I made yesterday, Friday. The day was supposed to bring snow, but instead it hung in limbo.

 Imagine a day of snowfall, just without snow. Or try it this way: Imagine the moment just before snow begins to fall, only stretched out endlessly, filling a whole day.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank"  href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/klaus_nomi/cold_song.html">What Power Art Thou</a>", the song of the Cold genius from Henry Purcell's "King Arthur", made popular in 1981 by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7WehY5vTl4">Klaus Nomi</a>. 

Looking it up on YouTube let me dicover some more interesting versions. How about this powerful rendition by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGDLZjUTQeU&feature=related">Matteo</a>, or maybe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9idBoj2sIs">Harnoncourt's production</a> from the Salzburg Festival, hilarious (I was there, I've seen it and I have the DVD), but, judging from the comments at Amazon, obviously not so popular with the English crowd. Of course, for the purists I can always recommend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jV56b_u4H8">John Eliot Gardiner</a>. Enjoy.
