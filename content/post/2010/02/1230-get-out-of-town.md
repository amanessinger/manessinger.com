Funny that I've never used that song. This is an HDR made yesterday morning. In reality it's no way "out of town", it's only the yard of one of those old tenement ensembles that make up so much of Vienna. Still, it looks almost rural to me or at least small-town.

 The Song of the Day is Cole Porter's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/holly_cole_trio/get_out_of_town.html">Get Out Of Town</a>", sung by the great Holly Cole on her 1996 live album "It Happened One Night". Typical me: I've waited for so many years to see her live, in two weeks she plays in Vienna, now guess who has no tickets???
