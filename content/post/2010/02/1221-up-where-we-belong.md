This one would probably have worked in color as well, but then probably not. I didn't try it for real ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joe_cocker_jennifer_warnes/up_where_we_belong.html">Up Where We Belong</a>" by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes, the big hit from the soundtrack of "An Officer And A Gentleman". I have it on a collection of love songs that's unavailable internationally, although availability of the original soundtrack album is not so great either ðŸ™‚

Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFYtpTot7hQ">YouTube</a>.
