It took me a time to figure out whether I have an image for Friday, or if I need one of these two for the next post. Turned out I have one, here's both Thursday images in one post ðŸ™‚

I have already shown images of that place, some even from the same vantage point, it's of course Mount <a target="_blank" href="/tag/dobratsch">Dobratsch</a> again, the mountain that broke apart, because it couldn't stand seeing people die, then in 1348, the year of the great plague.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100204_095019_photomatix_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100204_095019_photomatix_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I like both of these images. The choice is only because I had to choose. The one with the sun in the frame is an HDR again, again of the more subtle kind. The Image of the Day is of course from a single exposure.

I haven't been up there for very long, and in fact when I reached the upper end of the street, 450 meters below the summit, the sky was already veiled.

 And the rest of the day? Installing software, what else? That's why I am in Carinthia after all ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dire_straits/solid_rock.html">Solid Rock</a>" from the 1981 Dire Straits album "Making Movies". The Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler, obviously their label tries to get all their music off YouTube (how stunningly clever!), but I have still found at least some live versions. Here's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIhOqB6Hbjg">one from 1992</a>.
