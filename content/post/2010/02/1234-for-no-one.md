Here's one more of yesterday's images. I was too lazy to go out today. Sorry ðŸ™‚

This is an abandoned house not far from Klagenfurt, located in a wonderful spot, obviously belonging to an estate not far away, a solitary house, abandoned and closed, with an "Entrance forbidden" sign on the door, of use for no one.

 The Song of the Day is the Beatles song "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/for_no_one.html">For No One</a>", sung by Anne Sofie von Otter on her collabration with Elvis Costello, the 2001 release "For the Stars". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEv36g3Jk5A">YouTube</a>.
