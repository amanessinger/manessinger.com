Nothing ages faster than science fiction, and when I saw this image, when I tried variants and ended up with this toned B&amp;W, it immediately reminded me of 1950s science fiction movies.

Speaking of sci-fi, I'm still reading Orson Scott Card, and while "Ender's Game" did not overly impress me, "Speaker For The Dead" brought up some real clever questions, and now I am in the middle of "Xenocide". Seems like I will read the next one as well.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_bowie/a_better_future.html">A Better Future</a>" from David Bowie's 2002 album "Heathen". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boX8zNyhaL4">YouTube</a>.
