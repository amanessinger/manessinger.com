This is some sort of ... transporter, I guess. I have never seen anyone use it, it just stands there all the time, or at least whenever I am there.

As to the Song of the Day, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/monty_python/eric_the_half_a_bee.html">Eric The Half A Bee</a>" from "Monty Python Sings", well, let me put it this way: You are certainly allowed to not own or even not know this album, you are only not allowed to keep it that way ðŸ˜„

 Great stuff from before the world suffocated in political correctness. Almost unthinkable that Monty Python ever existed. Just think of "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MontyPython?blend=2&ob=1#p/u/22/CxVKtNkQAtw">Sit On My Face</a>", "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F67JhKT5bxU">Never Be Rude To An Arab</a>", "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04QoA44c23A&feature=related">I Like Chinese</a>", the "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9PiqCeLEmM">Penis Song</a>" or "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MontyPython?blend=2&ob=1#p/u/46/fUspLVStPbk">Every Sperm Is Sacred</a>". But then, <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/google-baulks-at-conroys-call-to-censor-youtube-20100211-ntm0.html">mindless jerks are already busy to censor free thinking away</a>. Enjoy it as long as you can.

Oh, and, today <a target="_blank" href="http://www.laquadrature.net/en/french-parliament-approves-net-censorship">France has chosen to establish Internet censorship</a>. Child porn, what else? Their law is even worse than the ill-fated German one, that was successfully fought by the German public last fall. No judges, no public, no evaluation phase for the law, just a secret list. I suppose Sarkozy's buddies from the content mafia will be pleased.

But then, let's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MontyPython?blend=2&ob=1#p/u/56/WlBiLNN1NhQ">Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life</a>" and hear the Song of the Day on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlrsqGal64w">YouTube</a>.
