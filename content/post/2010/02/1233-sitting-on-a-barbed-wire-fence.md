It's Sunday evening by now. I have whiled the day away and now I am in a hurry. As usual ðŸ™‚

 This images is from a short trip on Saturday afternoon. Saturday was warm and sunny, eating the snow away at enormous speed. The image is a composite of two exposures, one taken at f5.6, the other at f2.8.
