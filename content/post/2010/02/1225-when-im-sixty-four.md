This is not really an image, is it? But then, you know what this means? DONE!!!!

Mostly. There are some utilities that I still need to install, like WinRAR, Notepad++ and ... well, probably not much more. Photoshop with all plugins is installed, licenses are activated, the 64 bit Nvidia driver is installed, the game Morrowind is installed and runs like a charm, my image database is there, the virtual machine with Linux, mobile networking is installed and tested, so are my browsers, bookmarks, wallpapers, etc. Gosh, I'm really tired now!

 Image-wise I had some numbers 32 ready as well, just in case I would have to go back to Windows 7 32 bit, but fortunately this was not necessary.

The Song of the Day? "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/when_im_sixty_four.html">When I'm Sixty-Four</a>" from Sgt. Pepper, what else ðŸ˜„
