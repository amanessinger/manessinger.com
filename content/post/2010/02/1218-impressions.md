Oh my, I'm on the train again, traveling through a white winter landscape. This is an image that I made an hour ago, while going from work to the Underground.

 The Song of the Day is "Impressions". I have it on a double CD called "The Mastery of John Coltrane Vol. IV, Trane's Modes", but as this collection seems to be unavailable by now, I link to the 1963 release "Impressions". I'm pretty sure it's the same material anyway ðŸ™‚
