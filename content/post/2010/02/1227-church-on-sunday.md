Today Michael and I have again worked in his apartment. This consumed most of the day, which was quite unfortunate, because it was sunny and beautiful, almost like Spring beginning. On the other hand we progressed nicely, so I really shouldn't complain ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100221_095802_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100221_095802_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I've taken the two daylight images in the morning. The obelisk is a monument for Dr. Karl Lueger, Mayor of Vienna around 1900 and anti-Semite extraordinaire. But that's the way it is in Austria. I suppose the only reason why we don't idolize Hitler is, that it would be bad for our image. But of course I may be wrong.

They are hard pressed by McDonalds and all those Turkish DÃ¶ner kebab stands, but so far they have survived. It's probably not the most healthy diet, but the same could be said of McDonalds ðŸ™‚

 The Image of the Day was taken at night when I went home. The church is the same that you see in the background of the image with the obelisk.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/green_day/church_on_sunday.html">Church On Sunday</a>" from Green Day's 2000 album "Warning". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UE0U3V3rmM&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
