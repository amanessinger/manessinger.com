It's Friday night by now. No, I haven't fallen into a hole and I didn't vanish from the face of the planet. I was just a little busy.

Remember that I came back to Carinthia on Wednesday? Well, this is an image from Wednesday afternoon. When I arrived in Villach, it was a wonderfully clear, sunny day, and I just checked what the most likely cause of the computer problems would be, decided to buy a new system disk and a copy of Windows 7 Home 64bit, and then spent two hours drivinng around and photographing. What you see here is another HDR, the image was processed today, already on the new system.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/anita_oday/when_sunny_gets_blue.html">When Sunny Gets Blue</a>". Among other versions I have it as part two of a medley on Sheena Easton's 1993 album "No Strings". Of course it's not available on YouTube, but maybe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJnJKQiMs6A">Anita O'Day's version</a> can console you. I don't have it, but it's, well, Anita ðŸ™‚

On the other hand, I wouldn't easily dismiss Sheena Easton. She is not usually associated with Jazz standards, but this album is different. Very different. And not bad at all.
