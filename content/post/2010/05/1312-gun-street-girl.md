In the morning I went down the street that had been a torrent on Thursday afternoon, but you wouldn't really guess. A bit of dirt here and there, everything else gone.

 This image, well, I took it in the afternoon on my way home. Just another bike. Nice old girl.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/gun_street_girl.html">Gun Street Girl</a>" from Tom Waits' 1985 album "Rain Dogs". As always, fine music. The album track is not to be found on YouTube (Advertising? Who wants advertising?), but thankfully <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKobfeTg5iM&feature=related">a live version</a> is, and a pretty good one to boot.
