The olive tree is the most characteristic plant in the mediterranean. It's the source of olive oil, one especially healthy and pleasantly tasty kind of oil, the liquid gold of the past.

I made this image after dinner in <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&rls=en&q=pula&oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=Pula,+Croatia&ei=k136S8DROZCC_Qaqj4S8Cg&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=image&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ8gEwAA">Fa≈æana</a>, Croatia. The sun was setting when I saw the light playing in the trees and the crops. Again I took a bracketed burst of images, and again Photoshop (and I, adjusting one layer manually) did a better job aligning the images, than my HDR programs.

 I've got a coule of other images that I'm holding back. It's 1:15 pm now, it's wonderfully sunny and warm outside, I guess I'll have to go swimming. No idea if I come back with anything usable, if not, you'll see another image from yesterday's trip in the evening.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/the_mediterranean.html">The Mediterranean</a>" from the 2000 Beautiful South album "Painting It Red". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xHZaG9Kbpk">YouTube</a>.
