A rainy day, scarcity of images, but a lot of good music. On Saturday, hearing "Sweet Home Alabama" in a steakhouse, I completely failed to remember who sang this originally. I only had the song from the Leningrad Cowboys' "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks5CgSv_nCc">Total Balalaika Show</a>" (not that THAT would be a bad choice), but I was completely oblivious to Lynyrd Skynyrd. Shame on me. I have four of their albums now ðŸ™‚

The other revelation today were "<a href="http://www.arpeggiata.com/">L'Arpeggiata</a>". I stumbled across their album "Los Impossibles" on Amazon. One of those people-who-bought-this-also-bought-that recommendations. Oh dear, dig around their site and try not to buy a single album ðŸ™‚

 Yeah, and finally I bought two more Faithless albums, which brings me to four. The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cat_power/kind_of_peace.html">A Kind Of Peace</a>", featuring Cat Power,  from their 2006 album "To All New Arrivals". Great music. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAdhe9Ux-J4">YouTube</a>.
