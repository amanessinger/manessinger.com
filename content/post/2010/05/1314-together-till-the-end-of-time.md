This is one of the only two images that I made yesterday, both of the same subject. Oh dear, it's the same old story of being in a hurry in the morning, and struggling with rain in the afternoon. This was made in the rain ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/steve_winwood/together_till_the_end_of_time.html">Together Till The End Of Time</a>" from "The Live Adventures Of Mike Bloomfield And Al Kooper". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QebYImyyhuY">YouTube</a>. 

 Wonderful. Obviously this is not my version but that on "Fillmore East: The Lost Concert Tapes 12/13/68", and actually I like it better. Much better ðŸ™‚
