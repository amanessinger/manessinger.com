I'm back in Vienna, and although I've slept on the train, it's insanely late by now.

 Here's one more image of Saturday. I've made some images today (well, yesterday by now), but even though I like the compositions, they utterly lack subject, so I'll spare us the embarrassment and bother you with one more flower ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/terence_trent_darby/delicate.html">Delicate</a>" from Terence Trent D'Arby's 1993 album "Symphony Or Damn". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n5sd94XIRE">YouTube</a>.
