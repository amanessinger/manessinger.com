Muddy? Not in this image, no. We had rain in Carinthia this Saturday, but it was completely harmless. Not so in Vienna though. Just look at this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0MhD5NAUT0">video from Thursday afternoon</a>.

At the time I've been at home, only about 10 minutes from there. Of course I live at about the highest part of the district and this is the lowest, where the waters from 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> district flow together.

On Thursday afternoon the rain was as intense as I've ever seen, and normally this does not last longer than ten, maybe fifteen minutes, but this time it went on for almost an hour. I had no idea of the extent though until I saw this video. Here's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAN6GiHNaMY&feature=related">another one</a>.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madeleine_peyroux/muddy_water.html">Muddy Water</a>" from Madeleine Peyroux's 1996 album "Dreamland". Wonderful rendition, unfortunately it is not available on YouTube. I can give you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXfVoT4oTfg&feature=related">Bessie Smith</a> instead. Different but not bad ðŸ™‚
