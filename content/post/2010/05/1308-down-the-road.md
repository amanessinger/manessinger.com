In little more than an hour I have to leave for the train. It's Friday, yesterday was a public holiday in Austria (well, Catholicism is not ONLY about old men and young boys, you know) and I used the time to get a little outside of town. Here's one of the few usable images. Processing went along a little of its own, and when I saw what I got out of Photoshop while experimenting, I liked and kept it.

 The Song of the Day is "Down The Road" from Marcia Ball's 2005 album "Live! Down The Road". Finally we begin to see more of her on YouTube. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61LjZU2x6js&a=x0b25Q_NUPk&playnext_from=ML">Here is the song</a>, audio could be less muffled and there is indeed a version with better video and clear sound available, only it is not the same song ðŸ™‚
