The last two images for tonight. Promised ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100512_080630_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100512_080630_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Number one is one more time the staircase in my house here in Vienna.

 The Image of the Day is some kind of yucca that I found in the alley where my baker's shop is. Both have some twists and curves.

The Song of the Day is "Curly Locks" from SinÃ©ad O'Connor's 2005 Reggae album "Throw Down Your Arms". Excellent music, but obviously it was not a big success. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7ZKDpFq0C0">YouTube</a>.
