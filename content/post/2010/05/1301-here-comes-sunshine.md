One of the beautiful things in Spring is, how easily it takes you from rainy despair to sunny exaltation. Of course it can also go the other way round ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100506_083946_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100506_083946_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Remember that I dropped my bag with the camera in it, the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC mounted? Remember that the lens barrel broke and I sent it in for repair? Remember the tiny flaw of this lens, making the autofocus sometimes not reacting, needing a switch off/on of the camera?

 Well, it's gone! Obviously you have to drop it ðŸ™‚

Nope. Don't drop it. Unfortunately I did not write down the original serial number. They may have not repaired the lens at all but instead exchanged it (that's not what the shop said, though), or along with repairing the lens, they have made a firmware update. Fact is, I have used this lens for more than a week now and I have had no single problem with autofocus. It just works. Reliably. Precisely.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/grateful_dead/here_comes_sunshine.html">Here Comes Sunshine</a>" from the 1973 Grateful Dead album "Wake Of The Flood".
