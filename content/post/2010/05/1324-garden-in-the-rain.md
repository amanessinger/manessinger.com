Yesterday began with fair weather. I was even swimming, though I already heard thunder in a distance. This is an image from our garden by the lake, not exactly in the rain as the title suggests, but really shortly before. The flowers are two types of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquilegia">columbines</a>, aquilegia vulgaris the blue, and aquilegia Ã— hybrida the pink in the background. They were planted 40 years ago.

 The rest of the day was shopping for ingredients, and then about five or six hours of cooking FilÃ© Gumbo, complete with home-made chicken broth, roux and imported filÃ© powder ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/diana_krall/garden_in_the_rain.html">Garden In The Rain</a>" from Diana Krall's 1997 album "Love Scenes". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWib7Lc9u7c">YouTube</a>.
