The weather continues to be bad, I continue to be short on time. Oh well.

This image is from yesterday morning. I just fooled around, but actually I like the result. This is a crop down to almost six megapixel, the best I could do with practically no material ðŸ™‚

On the other hand, there were times when six megapixel were the normal resolution of professional cameras. I guess I shouldn't complain.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/richard_hawley/just_like_the_rain.html">Just Like The Rain</a>" from Richard Hawley's 2005 album "Coles Corner". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9YsRSsAtY8">YouTube</a>.
