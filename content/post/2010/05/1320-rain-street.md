Funny May this May. Looks a lot like April, weather-wise ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100525_163902_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100525_163902_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> We had two major downpours today, one of them with me right in. Here's what it looked like. Thankfully it didn't last more than a few minutes. Being without an umbrella, I gave in, went into the next restaurant and had dinner.

 And really, when I got out and went on home, the sun was bright and warm. I fooled around a little, took some images from street level, basically just holding the camera down and hoping for the best, and the Image of the Day is what I've got. Of course an articulated display and the camera set to Live View would have helped me getting much more predictable results, but on the other hand, when you have no idea what you're doing, a little randomness is actually a good thing ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pogues/rain_street.html">Rain Street</a>" from the 1990 Pogues album "Hell's Ditch". Always loved the band. Hear the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFp8SdZXfOY">album version</a> and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukhe-2yFxV8&feature=related">live version</a> on YouTube.
