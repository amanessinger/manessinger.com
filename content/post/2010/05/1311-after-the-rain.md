It was mostly cool today, not at all inviting to go out. I used a few minutes in the afternoon though to take this image. It's a series of bracketed exposures, sky and background taken from an HDR rendition made with Photomatix Pro, the foreground just being from one single light exposure.

 The rest of the day I worked on my Java Enterprise Edition 6 tutorial for <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">the other blog</a>. More than 16.000 words, 51 screen shots, lots of program code, and still not done yet. I admit, I already hate it ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/barbra_streisand/after_the_rain.html">After The Rain</a>" from Barbra Streisand's 1984 album "Wet". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KvwCh7c18">YouTube</a>.
