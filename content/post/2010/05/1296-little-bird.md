Today I came home with about 70 images, and almost all of them were trash. OK, many of them were other bird images, and you know those guys, they are about the worst kind of photo model you can find ðŸ™‚

The image was taken during a late breakfast. We were exploring the local McCafÃ© and I was pleasantly surprised. Fine coffee, good cakes, even birds for photographers. 

Oh yes, I was swimming. Not indoors, no, in the lake. It can't be more than 14, maybe 15 degrees Celsius, but for two minutes it's OK ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/annie_lennox/little_bird.html">Little Bird</a>", one of the admittely weaker songs on Annie Lennox' 1992 album "Diva". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ5GZ6ps7I4">Hear for yourself</a>.
