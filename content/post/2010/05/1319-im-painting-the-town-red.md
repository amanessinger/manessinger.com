It came as I thought it would. I made a single image today, that I want to spare you. Thus we are back to yesterday's trip to Croatia, this time to the ancient City of Pula, a city where you can still marvel at a Roman temple and arena, medieval churches and ... Austrian architecture. Pula was the harbor of the Austro-Hungarian empire's war fleet, and though the harbor has lost since much of its importance, it is still more industrious than touristic. 

This is part of Pula's railway station, once directly connecting to the harbor. I saw the poppies and the yellow flowers, and thankfully the area is not fenced off, thus I got the chance to take some images.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/im_painting_the_town_red.html">I'm Painting The Town Red</a>" by Billie Holiday. I have it on a collection that's unavailable, but from what I see, "A Portrait Of An Artist 1935-1946" with 25 songs for $5.99 is a decent offer. 

 The point is, all those early recordings are in the public domain now, thus it's really important to look at the price. Remember my "Ultimate Jazz Archive"? This collection of 168 Jazz CDs that I bought for 99â‚¬? Well, it's all public domain, but still, the price was more than OK. 

On the other hand, I recently saw some of those CDs sold separately, in fact it were not even CDs, it were MP3 tracks, and I saw them for $9.99. Each. Not each track, but each "album". Now multiply that with 168 and you get approximately $1680. Depending on the exchange rate of the Euro, this is a factor of roughly 15 - for the same thing, so, I can only tell you, try not to get shaved. There is no decency in the world.
