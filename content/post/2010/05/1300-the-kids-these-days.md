No colors today, sorry. The weather around here stays cool and rainy. I was in a hurry in the morning, I was in a hurry in the evening, I consider myself lucky having an image at all.

Hmm ... I wonder what goes on in the mind of someone who calls a children's bike "Puky"? It's completely beyond me ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "The Kids These Days" from Paul Heaton's 2008 album "The Cross Eyed Rambler". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gyCvwTXuxs">YouTube</a>.
