Two images for yesterday. It was a rainy day, dark and brooding (and so begins today). These are the days when I begin to search for colors ðŸ™‚

Shops are good places for that mood, even when you're not buying anything.

The colorful clothes hung outside of a shop in Neubaugasse. The image is straight from the camera. The other image, the triptych, is from a small shop in KaiserstraÃŸe.

Yes, it may induce technical compromises that otherwise take away from ultimate image quality, but really, do I care about a lens that, for instance, has lower distortions or CA, but can't take my picture? Hardly ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/james/one_of_the_three.html">One Of The Three</a>" from the 1993 James album "Laid". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q30eYcsFM2Y">YouTube</a>.
