Before I head for the train, instead of a genuine image of today, here is one more image of Tuesday. In case you wonder, it's a car ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ray_charles/come_rain_or_come_shine.html">Come Rain Or Come Shine</a>". Of course we had the song, but interestingly enough only once (I count 15 versions in my collection), and then, in "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/05/204-after-rain.html">204 â€“ After the Rain</a>",  it was by B.B. King and Eric Clapton. Today it is Ray Charles on his 1959 album "The Genius Of Ray Charles". Enjoy it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMYs3enTF8">YouTube</a>.
