I have no idea why, but sometimes an image just wants a border. This is one of them, and, well, actually I have an idea: It's a matter of balance. This image has a much lighter top edge than its bottom edge, and the border holds everything together. The black of the border along the top edge helps to contain the eye. It is an effect similar to that of a vignette, only that the subtlety of a vignette wouldn't have worked in this image.

 Anyway, this is an image taken Monday morning. I made some images today, but in the end I found nothing of value.

At the moment I am on the train to Carinthia, where I will stay until Tuesday evening. Weather is forecast to be fine tomorrow and from then on to get progressively worse. Oh well.

The Song of the Day is "So Long" from the 2007 album "You Can't Buy A Gun When You're Crying" by Holly Golightly & The Brokeoffs. Excellent stuff ðŸ™‚

YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNl_2lgKgiU">live video</a> that's, well, so-so.
