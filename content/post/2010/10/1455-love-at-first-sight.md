Even using the "focus assist" LED in the viewfinder, manually focusing an 85/1.4 wide open is painful and I wouldn't bet on the results. But still: when you manage to get something in focus, the image has a certain quality, that I haven't seen with any other lens so far.

At the moment I am on the train to Carinthia, it's incredibly beautiful outside, golden light on a wonderful autumn landscape, it's breathtaking and really a pity that I can't take images ðŸ™‚

 On the other hand, weather is supposed to be fine this weekend, and I hope to get my share of images. Our share, that is ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Love At First Sight" from John Mellencamp's new album "No Better Than This". Excellent music, but just hear for yourself on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0d2ilfkmoQ">YouTube</a>.
