I'm on the train back from Vienna to Carinthia, and at least on the mountains that I crossed around sunset, there was hardly a trace of snow left. To the contrary: it was the most beautiful autumn landscape with the most perfect evening sky above. Of course I couldn't take an image from out of the train, but I thoroughly the view.

 But let's not talk about today. It's Friday and this is the post for yesterday. I took some images of flowers and this is a composite of two exposures. One had the better background, one the sharper flower. I don't really understand how the background could have been different, I hardly moved at all. The golden sparks in the background may be lights, filtered through the leaves, I have no idea, but I definitely like the effect.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/came_so_far_for_beauty.html">Came So Far For Beauty</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 1979 album "Recent Songs". I've bought some Cohen albums recently, and although the title is maybe a tad far-fetched, I thought I just have to point you one more time in his direction ðŸ˜„

Here's the song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLfZCraw_4c">YouTube</a>.
