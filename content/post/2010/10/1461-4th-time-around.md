I am not always that persistent, but when I began my blog four years ago, I had already experimented with photography for more than two years, several month of that with the Nikon D200.

I had not taken that many images, had not used the camera on such a regular schedule as daily, but it was certainly above average as regards frequency.

In a way I knew what it meant to live with the camera, and I knew that I could do that for a long time, so when I began uploading images for my blog to SmugMug, I used a numbering scheme with five digits, the first Image of the Day called "00001" on SmugMug.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101014_084528_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101014_084528_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> At that time SmugMug seemed like a good idea, and Blogger as platform for the blog was the natural choice, as I already had a (very irregular) gaming blog there, that I used for announcements of my Unreal Tournament 2004 maps.

About two years ago SmugMug went through a phase of instability, and when it was down once too often, I decided to move my images to my own (shared) server account. This seemed easy enough, I would only have to export the blog from Blogger, change the image URLs, and finally re-import the blog. The problem was, that I got errors upong re-importing, and that finally forced me to part with Blogger as well. From <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fineartphotoblog.com/">Fine Art Photoblog</a> I had some exposure to WordPress, thus this choice was natural as well, and this is where I arrived at where I am now.

 Tired? Yes, sometimes. Sometimes it is tedious to post an image every day. Sometimes it is hard to come up with a title every day. Sometimes ... 

I could stop at any time. I could just stop doing it daily, and that could probably make me stop at all. I think it's so much easier to stop doing something, when you don't do it daily. You stop just for a few days, make a pause, and then the pauses get longer, and then, some time, you find that you can't call it other than that you have stopped. Maybe. I guess I won't find out anytime soon though ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/4th_time_around.html">4th Time Around</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1966 masterpiece "Blonde On Blonde". You know it, but hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mh_1r66L-8">YouTube</a> anyway.
