I had to run errands today, went to the hairdresser's, had the summer tires on the car changed for winter tires, and there something went wrong. Although the appointment had been fixed two weeks ago, some woman managed to hi-jack it. She went into the shop, said she had an appointment, the clerk asked for the license number, the woman hesitated, and when the clerk showed her mine and asked if it was hers, she simply said yes and got my appointment.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101030_110413_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101030_110413_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> When I actually showed up at 10:30 and said my license number, the clerk was dismayed, but the damage was done. They fixed it, but instead of half an hour, the whole thing took more than two.

And that was fine. I had no problem at all. Things would have been different on a rainy day, but it was beautifully sunny outside, warm, and waiting meant nothing but taking a walk and enjoying the splendor. Bad? Not at all ðŸ™‚

 By the way, Kate from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastersdegree.net/">Mastersdegree.net</a> asked me to link to their list of "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastersdegree.net/blog/2010/25-photographs-every-american-should-know/">25 Photographs Every American Should Know</a>". Not  being American, I am somewhat excused, but I agree, this is a fine list of memorable images. Of course all such lists are subjective, but then, on some images all seem to agree. Just <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastersdegree.net/blog/2010/25-photographs-every-american-should-know/">see for yourself and enjoy</a>.

The Song of the Day is "Dead Friends (Around The Corner)", a beautiful and contemplative song from the 2004 EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten album "Perpetuum Mobile". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUEB0xjCK5A">YouTube</a>.
