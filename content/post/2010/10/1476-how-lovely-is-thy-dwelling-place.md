Here's one more (and last) post for today. The building where I work act as a giant mirror.

 I can't say that I am a big fan of Johannes Brahms, but neither is the opposite true. I simply have not heard enough of his music. Don't know why, it's just that way. What I really love though, is his "German Requiem", and although I have a couple of recordings, I never had an English version. Or at least I thought so. 

Twenty years ago I bought a CD, "Anthems From Salisbury", in the Salisbury cathedral shop, and today, when I looked for a title, I found this track. A nice surprise and probably a good reason to fork over the money for the Telarc recording with Craig Jessop, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir &amp; Utah Symphony ðŸ™‚

Here's another one on YouTube by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GSl4lSVf5s&feature=related">UCLA Chorale and American Youth Symphony</a>. Not bad either.
