Can you remember the advertising column in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/09/1445-pablo-picasso.html">1445 - Pablo Picasso</a>"? Well, here it is again, this time advertising Richard Strauss' opera "<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne_auf_Naxos">Ariadne auf Naxos</a>" played at "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theater-wien.at/">Theater an der Wien</a>" in Vienna. 

I saw the poster, liked the idea of the split face, and when I looked at the background, it struck me how it contained all the same colors. It was pretty impossible to frame a good picture, but I snapped it anyway, you never know what you can make in Photoshop.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101004_163705.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101004_163705.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> For your reference, here's the before.

It was clear from the beginning, that I would go for a half/half split image again, and so I had to do some twisting and stretching to get it all aligned. Additionally I fixed colors and contrast, but still, it was missing something. There was a unity in color, but the two parts of the image were too unrelated, and thus it fell apart.

 My solution was a texture, and not a flimsy one ðŸ™‚

I rarely use texture overlays. So frequently they are used to simulate something that's not a property of the image, but a property of its physical representation. i.e. age,  but here I like it greatly, because it is obvious, deliberate, and it immediately ties the two halves together.
