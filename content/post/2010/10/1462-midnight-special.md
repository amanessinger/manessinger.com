It's Friday, it was gloomy the whole day (at least as far as I know, most of it I spent in a room without windows, teaching), I had neither time nor much inclination in the morning, and now I am on the train to Carinthia.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100625_220450_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100625_220450_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These are the days when I'm glad to have some finished but unused images already uploaded, and that's how you get to see another pair of images from Italy. 

Both were taken the night before our departure, both were taken from the exact same spot. The blue light in the Image of the Day is the light that comes from the bar.

This is how it looks, when you are far from the beach, far from the hotels and the fancy restaurants. Michael failed to keep from smoking, and when he went to the train station for a pack of cigarettes, I joined him and took some night images.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/van_morrison/midnight_special.html">Midnight Special</a>". I recently bought it on a Van Morrison collection called "Brown-Eyed Girl", a collection of early hits, but originally it is from his debut album "Blowin' Your Mind!". Oh, and, that's pretty much what it does ðŸ˜„

YouTube has a <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvkmWKu5M8">live version</a> with extra guests from much later.
