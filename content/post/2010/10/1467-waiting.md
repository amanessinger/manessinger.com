We didn't have a lot of bicycles lately. That's not because I don't take images of them, I do so almost daily, but there is definitely some repetition. This image is no exception. It's the usual interplay of the simple shapes of the bike with lines on the ground.

 The Song of the Day is "Waiting" from the 1987 Style Council album "The Cost Of Loving". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YsklP-Ah4o">YouTube</a>. A mediocre song for a mediocre image ðŸ™‚
