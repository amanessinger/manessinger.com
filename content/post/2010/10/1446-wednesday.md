This is an image from, well, Wednesday. I had a guest Wednesday night, we cooked and played music till after midnight, and so I'm a tad behind again. 

 The Song of the Day, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tori_amos/wednesday.html">Wednesday</a>" from Tori Amos' current album "Scarlet's Walk" has no other connection to the image but the name, but it is a fine song nevertheless, and I wanted to point you to the album anyway. Don't expect hits though, this is more of a story-telling concept album, but then again, great stuff. Hear the Song on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIN6CI2qNlM&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
