This is Alex. I met him on the street today, and while I walked by, he noticed the lens on my camera. Being a Nikon photographer himself, he wondered if I had a Nikon 50/1.2, and when I said "Yes, but that's not the 50/1.2, it is the 85/1.4", we began to talk about this lens' merits. As a demonstration, I took an image of him, and while this was taken on a busy street, without consideration for the background whatsoever, the result is absolutely pleasing. Sure, I could have waited for the red car (?) to vanish, in order for less of a color clash, but other than that, there is nothing wrong with the image.

I really liked this "demo shot", so I asked Alex for permission to use it on the blog. Being a cool, nice guy, he agreed ðŸ™‚ 

 Ever wondered why this lens is commonly referred to as a portrait lens? There must be a reason, and I guess it's clear now ðŸ˜„

Btw: the image is straight out of the camera.
