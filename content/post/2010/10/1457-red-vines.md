Another beautiful autumn day in Carinthia. Here is an image taken with the Nikon 85/1.4 AI-S, not for the bokeh, just because I had it mounted.

 I have processed this image, I have even fixed some distortions, but it is only because I had not stood perpendicularly to the wall. Other that that, there is absolutely no barrel or pin cushion distortion.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aimee_mann/red_vines.html">Red Vines</a>" from the 2000 album "Bachelor No. 2" by Aimee Mann. YouTube has a various live videos, for instance <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTuQLjUiiiw&feature=related">this one</a>.
