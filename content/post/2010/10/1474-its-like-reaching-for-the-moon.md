I'm back in Vienna and here it is cold as well, but no snow has fallen yet.

But then, It's not that bad. It's just as time goes by. I could get mad about it, but then, weather won't care a bit.

It's late night now and I hear music, or better, I hear recommendations on Amazon.de. Funny, huh? I buy lots and lots of music, and that despite of my loathing for the music industry. But then, it's the music that I like, not the industry.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101027_163309_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101027_163309_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> As to the images, well, the flower is just a flower. It's mind-boggling to think of how much the city of Vienna spends on flowers, but on the other hand, I wouldn't want to miss the flowers in this city. 

 The other image, ... I don't exactly know what made me take it. It's just some kind of well-balanced web of cables, and the red light maybe takes on an ominous meaning. The moon, uh ... well, you know, I was actually walking and this image was taken in the middle of a busy street. The moon, it was not exactly where I wanted it to be. Initially ðŸ™‚
