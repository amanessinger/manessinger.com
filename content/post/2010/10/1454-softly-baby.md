Books come in different sizes, and when you are like me and order your books alphabetically by author, then there is always a book that does not fit.

Like this one. It's the "Codex Derynianus", an encyclopedic collection about  Katherine Kurtz' "Deryni Chronicles", a fantasy series spanning hundreds of years of fictional history in a medieval setting.

It's more that, well, ... do you realize how softly this bicycle goes out of focus? 

I mean, the real thing is, that I had been provoked in the most outrageous way. This hunk of glass had been sitting squarely in the window of a shop right around the corner. FOR DAYS!!!!

 Uhh ... without much ado ... Ladies and Gentlemen, the Nikkor 85/1.4 AI-S ðŸ˜„
