I've been in a grave the whole day. Seven hours teaching Java in a room without windows, I can tell you, when you get out of that, you appreciate every last ray of light, that you can get.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101013_173909.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101013_173909.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> I took these two images today on my way home, and while I am certain that they could be improved with a tad of post-processing, I just leave them as they came out of the camera.

 In fact I like how they look, and I am not sure how to improve them. Yes, they lack contract, but I greatly love the subtle play of colors. And besides, did I say I'm tired?

The Song of the Day comes in two flavors this time. It's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/in_the_evening_when_the_sun_goes_down.html">In The Evening (When The Sun Goes Down)</a>", and the video, that I've <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7WlfJFzbVE">uploaded to YouTube</a>, first shows you Ella Fitzgerald's version, and then I have added Joe Williams. I simply couldn't decide which I liked most, and none of them was available on YouTube before.

 By the way, this is one of the cases when a video is not available everywhere. This time it's only Germany, not the whole world. WMG was so kind as to let it be blocked in Germany. But of course, it's understandable. It's for the benefit of Ella and Joe. They can't possible be creative and go on making music, when their work is as devalued as it is by being heard. So, please support Ella and Joe, kindle their creative spark, by not hearing their music.

You say they're ... what? Dead??? Can't be, can it?
