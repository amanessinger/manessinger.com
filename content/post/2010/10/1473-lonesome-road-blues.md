I'm on the train back to Vienna and this is an image of today. It stopped snowing, but it was still cold, albeit above freezing. For the rest of the week, weather is supposed to be mostly sunny, thus I hope the snow will be gone until I return on Friday.

 The Song of the Day is "Lonesome Road Blues", and if you expect Muddy Waters, then you're wrong. I mean Joe Bonamassa on his 2009 album "The Ballad of John Henry". YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmHifJM5Cpk">live version</a>.

Funny, even the cover is a perfect match for the image ðŸ˜„
