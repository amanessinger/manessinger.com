"Fallende BlÃ¤tter", that's "falling leaves" in German, so obviously this topic keeps me working. Today was just like yesterday. All my images circled around falling or fallen leaves.

And there's more. I am back to the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC, as I said, my most used lens, and it's just as every time when I change from a manual focus lens to an AF-lens: WOW! Auto-focus! Unbeliiiiievable!!!!!

Really, it sounds stupid, but just try it yourself: get a manual lens (maybe that's not possible for Canon users, because when Canon changed to AF, they changed their lens mount), a used one, cheaply from eBay or from a second-hand dealer, use it for a time, enjoy the slow-down, and then change back to a modern AF lens. Incredible! You'll love the experience.

 By the way, you know about my troubles with the Tammy, so when today I found that all my images of a certain subject were over-exposed, I was once again in that "I-throw-it-away-and-buy-the-Sigma-today" mood, but then I realized, that I had inadvertently switched the camera from matrix metering to spot metering. Oh dear, paranoia makes you stupid ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Fallende BlÃ¤tter" from the 2001 Element of Crime album "Romantik", and as I never actually mentioned, but as it was for all the other Elements of Crime songs of the last months, this is again dedicated to <a target="_blank" href="http://1-photo-a-day.blogspot.com/">Janine</a>.
