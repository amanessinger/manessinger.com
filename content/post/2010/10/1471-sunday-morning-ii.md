Today was much better than forecast, in the morning we even had some sun.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101024_081025_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101024_081025_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I failed to go out, but at least I made some morning images from the balcony.

I just love that silent moments, when nobody is outside, you only hear the occasional dog barking, birds chirping, all in the warm morning light.

I don't expect to be able to catch any beautiful light, but then, it's not all about light, and if all else fails, I still have plenty of older images.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricstime.com/zeebee-sunday-morning-lyrics.html">Sunday Morning</a>", and this time I don't mean the Velvet Underground song, this time I mean a song by Austrian singer Eva Engel, better known as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeebee">zeebee</a>. It's from her second album "Priorities". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=597Ye166chs">YouTube</a>.
