It's a strange year. It goes by with incredible speed. I almost did not register summer, and even before August it was essentially gone. I still called it summer, but it felt like an early fall. Now it's fall and I almost missed the spectacular changes. I began photographing trees, when most of the leaves were already going down. <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.whattheduck.net/strip/1076">What the duck!</a>

But then, how do they say? "Don't Ever Let Nobody Drag Your Spirit Down" ðŸ™‚

 And that's also the Song of the Day, brought to you by Eric Burdon on his spectacular 2006 album "Soul Of A Man". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Vn3YBSyDA">YouTube</a> has it, and for some insane reason it's only available as CD. Isn't that stupid? I'd expect of this ever-whining industry that they at least try to sell us what they complain is pirated online. I mean, really, how much does it cost to distribute a song or an album as digital downloads? No, instead they try to bring us the insanity that is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stopacta.info/">ACTA</a>, or they make <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACS:Law">an industry of pseudo-legal actions</a> intended to scare their future clients into expensive settlements.

So, dear content mafia, please shut up whining, stop bribing corrupt politicians into taking away our freedom, just do your damn job and at least try to sell what you have. We're waiting and we'd even be buying ðŸ˜„
