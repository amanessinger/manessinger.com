It's Friday, I'm on the train to Carinthia and here is the image of yesterday. Just a tiny children's bike that I saw on my way to work. It stood next to a big car, and the juxtaposition was funny, but I could impossibly make it into a composition, so I played off of the lines of the sidewalk and the fence ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Spring And Fall: To A Young Child" from Natalie Merchant's new album "Leave Your Sleep". We already had it once, but I can't praise it enough, so here we go again. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3q9zQ5AMg5g">live performance</a>.
