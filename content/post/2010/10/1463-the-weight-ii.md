In a comment to ‚Äú<a target="_blank" href="/2010/10/1454-softly-baby.html">1454 ‚Äì Softly Baby</a>‚Äù, responding to my recent purchase of the Nikon 85/1.4 AI-S, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nobodys-domain.de/">Thomas</a> asked me jokingly if I ever carry around all my lenses.

No. No, I don't, and even if I wanted to, I have no bag that's big enough. On the other hand, I don't need to. I have a "Weekend & Travel Kit", consisting of Sigma 8-16, Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC and Nikon 70-300 VR. These are the lenses that I've always with me on my way from Vienna to Carinthia and back, as well as on all trips and travels. That's heavy enough. 

The Nikon 50/1.8 stays in the bag in Carinthia, and at all times I combine the travel kit with one or two other lenses. Frequently it's the Sigma 70/2.8 Macro and a prime, for instance the Sigma 28/1.8, but that varies. At the moment it's the Nikon 50/1.2 AI-S and the Nikon 85/1.4 AI-S.

 The Image of the Day (yesterday really) was made last Winter. I used the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC, and although I had my share of troubles with this lens, I can say that from today it is my most used lens, at least what regards Images of the Day. 232 were made with the Tammy, 231 with the Nikon 18-200 VR, and the next is the Sigma 10-20 at mere 119. I rarely use the 18-200 these days and I consider the Sigma 10-20 damaged, thus the Tammy will keep its crown for quite some time. Not bad for a lens that's not yet one year old.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aretha_franklin/the_weight.html">The Weight</a>", this time not by Dylan &amp; The Band, this time it is Cassandra Wilson on her 2002 album "Belly Of The Sun". Not bad either. Not at all bad üôÇ
