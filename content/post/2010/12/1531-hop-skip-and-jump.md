Here's another combo of ad posters. More in tune than the last couple, but nevertheless funny I think ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "Hop, Skip and Jump" by Slam Stewart. I have it on disc 86 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive", that wonderful box of 168 Jazz CDs that I once bought for 99â‚¬.

The cheapest price for it at Amazon.com is now $359.20, and at the same time downloads of some of the single CDs are sold at normal prices for full albums. I suppose that's what you get for endlessly extending copyrights. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne4aaF7x1C8">YouTube</a>.
