The Christmas market on Spittelberg (which is not a mountain at all, but a picturesque part of Vienna with a strong artistic community) is one of the more interesting in Vienna. Narrow lanes in a historic setting, a focus on craftwork, and all that among restaurants and pubs. It's a nice place.

 The Song of the Day is the "Adagio" from the "Christmas Concerto" by Arcangelo Corelli. I have a recording by Roy Goodman and The Brandenburg Consort. It's only available on CD though. Amazon will tell you they have it as MP3 as well, but the link leads to a completely other version. But then, just browse around, much has been published since I was focusing on Baroque. YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=129B5C138DAAF114">playlist with the complete concerto</a> by Roy Goodman.
