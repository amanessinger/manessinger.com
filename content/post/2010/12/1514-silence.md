As already announced, here's another image from my Sunday trip up river Gail. Same place as in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/12/1513-the-cool-cool-river-ii.html">1513 - The Cool, Cool River II</a>", same time, only this is HDR based on Photomatix Pro and a series of bracketed images taken with the Sigma 8-16. It is slightly cropped (maybe to an equivalent of 10 mm ðŸ™‚), and as always with this kind of image, it is more of an interpretation than a strict representation of reality. The colors are a tad different from the image before, but then, hey, it's another image, optimized for itself, not for being part of a series.

The title is "Silence". Why? Well, because of a certain quality of relation between the two stones in the foreground, the two suns and several other prominently placed stones. The reflection of the sun in the center really becomes the center of the image, becomes the center of a micro solar system. Silence? Why? Hmm ... have you ever heard of sound in space? ðŸ˜›

Bad news is, the Song of the Day, "Silence" by Zoe.LeelA, is not available for sale via Amazon, but the good new is, it is available as a <a target="_blank" href="http://rec72.net/?p=578">free download from rec72</a>. In any case you can hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8UowGkdwwU">YouTube</a>.
