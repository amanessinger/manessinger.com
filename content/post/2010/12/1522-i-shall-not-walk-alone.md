It's Friday again, I'm on the train to Carinthia, and one more time I've got a terrible backlog. Sometimes it's simply impossible to avoid it. Sorry for that ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101214_143103_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101214_143103_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These are the images of Tuesday. Tuesday we had heavy snowfall and I left work early to meet my sister. I had to wait a few minutes and used them in my usual way.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101214_143402_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101214_143402_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Only later when I looked at the images, I found that I had kind of a series: a series of walkers. Along with the traffic sign this was enough to spark my interest.

Btw, I have recently bought onOne Software's plugin "Photo Frame", and at the moment I have great fun using those frames, especially for snow images. You'll see more of that soon.

 There is at least one more image of Tuesday, but I guess I will use it for Thursday. It doesn't fit into this series, but I really like it and believe it deserves to be an Image of the Day.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/ben_harper/i_shall_not_walk_alone.html">I Shall Not Walk Alone</a>" from the 2002 album "Higher Ground" by the Blind Boys of Alabama.
