I found this Vespa scooter today, survivor of the past snow, one that barely got away.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/devil_doll/the_one_who_got_away.html">The One Who Got Away</a>" from the 2007 Devil Doll album "The Return of Eve". Mind though, this is NOT the same Italian-Slovenian experimental rock band by some Mr Doctor, that was known under that name, this is the band of American singer Colleen Duffy. Not bad either, although the usurpation of the name did piss some people on Amazon severely off. And I can understand it. I just heard <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAyXwF2g0Ng&feature=related">some</a> of the songs of the earlier band on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDs_Z3kqgw">YouTube</a>: Excellent material.

Anyway. Here's Colleen's song, up on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92BVh1Ocjao">YouTube</a> as well.
