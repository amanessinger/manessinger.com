 I have recently bought <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ononesoftware.com/products/photoframe/">onOne PhotoFrame</a>. Well, I tried their free version (with only a few frames and textures) and I liked it.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/memories.html">Memories</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 1977 album "Death of a Ladies' Man".

Once I had "I Am a Hotel" on video (in the long gone Video 2000 format), and I absolutely loved that song, but I didn't know the title. It was only a few months ago that I found out ðŸ™‚
