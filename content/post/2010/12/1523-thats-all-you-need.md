Usually Vienna doesn't get much snow, and Viennese drivers are notorious for driving through winter with their summer tires. Since two or three years, law requires us to use winter tires in winter, but, you know, that's the kind of law that's hard to enforce and easy to break, and therefore it is more of a theoretical matter.

 Now, in a situation like the current, one would probably expect people to leave their cars in the garage and use public transport. The opposite is true though. People expect delays of the public trains and buses, and therefore even more people go by car than normally. Of course due to lack of experience and bad tires, a lot of cars get stuck or cause accidents, and that in turn causes, you guess it, delays of public transport. A neat, self-fulfilling prophecy. It takes a little snow and that's all you need ðŸ˜„

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/faces/thats_all_you_need.html">That's All You Need</a>" is another song from the 1971 Faces live album "A Nod Is As Good As A Wink To A Blind Horse". Rod Steward and Ron Wood at their best. See a video of a performance on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh_vmRUqtEs">YouTube</a>.
