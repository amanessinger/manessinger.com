Austria is a catholic country, and therefore we celebrate the conception of Christ. How exactly Jesus was born only three weeks after his conception, that is not exactly clear, but then, as a son of a God, excuse me, THE Son of GOD, he may have been allowed to take a shortcut.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101208_114115_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101208_114115_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> And because we all are devout followers of our Pope in Rome, we celebrate the day in a fashion that's truly compatible with the way the Church has been the most important ally of the Mighty and Wealthy in 1700 years. We go shopping.

I didn't go shopping, but I did go out for the sun. Today was a beautiful day, and as long as you stayed in high places or on very wide streets, you had some chance to not only see blue sky, but to even feel the sun. Obviously the weather forecast of heavy rain was slightly exaggerated ðŸ™‚

 There are at least two more images, but I have only tagged them as "TODO". You may see them some other day.

The Song of the Day is "For The Sun" from Amanda Jenssen's current album "Happyland". Here it is on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBY9f88Az8&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
