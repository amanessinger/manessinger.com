It's Monday evening. I took a day off and right now I am on the train to Vienna. This is an image of today. Weather-wise staying in Carinthia was an excellent choice. I didn't make a lot of images but I like this one.

 The Song of the Day is "There's A River". You may know the original by Steve Winwood, but today we hear in from the Peter Green Splinter Group. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ra752Ylr2A">YouTube</a> has it.
