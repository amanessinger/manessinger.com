Back to the river, same place as yesterday, roughly the same place as last Sunday.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101211_123226_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101211_123226_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In fact, although it was a bright and sunny day, I didn't go out today. I didn't feel like that, and I had so many images from yesterday, that it would have been stressful to make more.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101211_125357_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101211_125357_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> All of yesterday's images were taken within 25 minutes, starting at about 12:30. Amazing how low the sun hangs at this time of the year, huh? OK, that's peanuts for <a target="_blank" href="http://lightscrape.blogspot.com/">Juha</a>, but, honestly, sundowns at 15:30, that's enough winter for me ðŸ™‚

The river bed has been flooded and the place where I stood a week ago is now right in the middle of the river and  inaccessible. Obviously they keep the flow through the power station constant. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101211_122910_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101211_122910_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> That's fine for me, because it means water levels in this place vary wildly, and that makes it interesting to come back often.

 I haven't been on top of Dobratsch this year, maybe in January. So far my interest in snow was perfectly satisfied with these snowy riverscapes, and there's more snow predicted for next week.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/barbra_streisand/when_sunny_gets_blue.html">When Sunny Gets Blue</a>" from Barbra Streisand's 1967 album "Simply Streisand".
