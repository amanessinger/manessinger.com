OK, third post for today, this one is for yesterday, Thursday, and the bicycle image actually is from yesterday.

The Image of the Day is not. It is the image that I meant two posts ago, the image that did not belong among the walking men, the image from Tuesday.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101216_084233_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101216_084233_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Dealing with snow, I tend to heavily enforce local contrast in the near-whites. Currently I mostly use the Topaz Adjust preset "Dramatic" for that, and of course I always use it with a mask, applying it selectively. I have used other plugins before, it doesn't matter what you use, you can work with curves as well, it's only important that you boost the contrasts without burning out the whites.

 I am not sure why we see so much better in real snow than we do in a photograph of snow, but I guess movement may matter. When you move, even the smallest contrasts move with you, the image always changes, because your perspective always changes, and movement is something that our eyes are trained to see. Of course in a still image nothing moves, and so I have to help you along with higher contrasts ðŸ™‚
