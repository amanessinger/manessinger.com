This is the same river as in yesterday's image, only this is not HDR, and the place is a few kilometers upstream.

 Much less water, huh? Well, the reason is, that part of the river runs through another bed and drives a power station.

Most of the images of today were HDR sequences and you will definitely see some more of them, but for now I have to get ready for the trip back to Vienna.

Just as yesterday, the Song of the Day is “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_simon/the_cool_cool_river.html">The Cool, Cool River</a>” from Paul Simon’s 1990 album “The Rhythm of the Saints”. You can still hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LUyp34g3p8">YouTube</a>.
