And it snows and it snows and it snows. It's not so bad here in Vienna, but I guess in Carinthia we will approach half a meter. But then, I'll see it tomorrow.

 The street in this image is Mariahilfer Stra√üe, one of the major shopping streets in Vienna, and certainly the most lively. I took this image from the from the second story terrace of a new wine supermarket and bar, the new flagship store of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.weinundco.at/">Wein & Co</a>.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/brian_eno/everything_merges_with_the_night.html">Everything Merges With The Night</a>". Well, probably a stupid title for just THIS image, but I've been waiting for weeks now to recommend you Brian Eno's 1975 album "Another Green World". Now, stupid or not, here we go. It's typically Eno. Not pompous, not flashy, just beautiful music. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dmx4pRUpnk">YouTube</a>.
