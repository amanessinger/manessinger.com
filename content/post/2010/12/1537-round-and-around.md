Will I buy a D400? So far I was absolutely sure, but then, do I need it?

The most likely time for the D400 (as I guess it will be called) to appear is next Spring. The follow-up for the D700 could come in late Summer, but let's disregard a switch to FX for the moment, as I can see no real advantage.

But the D400 would be able to use all my lenses, would go from 12 to 16 megapixel and would give me one stop in low-light sensitivity. Basically it would be the D7000 in an even more solid body. I suppose Nikon will have to throw in at least one major feature, because zooming to 100% with the center button of the four-way selector (as much as I love it) can hardly be the only functional difference, can it? But then, what could a new feature be? And would I need it?

I see no reason why I should go from Photoshop CS3 to CS5. It would cost me money, time, and I definitely see no value in it, thus I would have to incorporate conversion of D400 RAW files to DNG into my workflow. My images would get bigger and processing slower. Do I want that? What for?

You see the pattern? And even if I decided to buy the D400, why should I do it in Spring? The most important feature for me would be the better high-ISO quality, but do I need that in Spring or Summer? Not really. Shooting in low light is something I do in Winter.

 You see, there are many good questions and not many honest answers that would allow me to rationalize the purchase. On the other hand, I had similar thoughts before my upgrade to the D300, and my reluctance held up half a day after I had seen the camera for the first time ðŸ˜„

What about you? Is there a point where you simply stop upgrading, or is the lure always stronger than reason? What is "good enough" for you? Are you already at that point, and if so, when did you cross the line?

So my thoughts go "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/chris_de_burgh/round_and_around.html">Round And Around</a>", and that's also the title of my Song of the Day, a song from Chris De Burgh's 1977 album "At the End of a Perfect Day".
