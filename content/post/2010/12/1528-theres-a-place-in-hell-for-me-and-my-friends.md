It's Tuesday night and this is the image for yesterday. I only made a few images, and this is one that I really like. 

 The image is underexposed and its white balance is completely off. I have made a habit of always setting the camera back to my default settings immediately after I have taken a picture, but sometimes I forget it, and this was such a case. Here the result is really good. Had I taken the image normally, I would never have had the idea to use such hellish colors.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/theres_a_place_in_hell_for_me_my_friends.html">There's A Place In Hell For Me And My Friends</a>" from Morrissey's 1991 album "Kill Uncle".
