Looks like a strange image to post for a year's end, huh? A bit morbid? Yes, maybe, but I can't help it, this is what I've got today. It was intended to be in colors, but when I routinely checked how it would look in B&amp;W, I found the result to be much better.

 The Song of the Day is by one of the giants who died this year. Don Van Vliet, a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, passed away on December, 17. "Flower Pot" is from his 1967 album "Safe As Milk". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O74AMcKUMP4">YouTube</a>. 

Hmm ... and this is probably also a strange topic for a year's end ðŸ˜›

Anyway. I wish you a Happy New Year!
