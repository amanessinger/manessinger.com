What can you do with 130 images taken in two hours? Pick out one best, forget the rest? So far I have processed 12 images taken on Sunday, and I will publish them in three or four parts. Hope you don't mind.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101219_124950_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101219_124950_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Sunday I went back to the river, only to find the water level back to low and the the now dried up parts of the river bed again covered with snow.

This time I went along a snow-covered way in the forest, running parallel to the river, trying to get up the river ahead of where I had been the last two times. Two or three times I left the way and headed towards the river, following rabbit tracks, only to find myself unable to get down the steep slope to the river bed. Or rather, I certainly would have managed to get down. It's getting up what would have been challenging ðŸ˜›

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101219_125639_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101219_125639_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In the end I managed to get down in two places, and every time I followed the river until I could not go further on. All in all I did not get that far away from the road, but progress is slow in deep snow, and using the Sigma 8-16 (did I ever say this is a fantastic landscape lens?), the boulders and pools offered plenty of opportunity to play with big foregrounds. 

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/skating_away_on_the_thin_ice_of_the_new_day.html">Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day</a>", originally from the 1974 Jethro Tull album "War Child", but today I really urge you to try the version on the 2005 double album "Ian Anderson Plays The Orchestral Jethro Tull". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlyLz7F18Og&feature=related">YouTube</a> has a video.
