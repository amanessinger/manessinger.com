The seventh and last post for today. Well, technically it's already well past midnight, but what counts, is that I have caught up and it feels pretty good!

Hmm ... a week of posting in one day, that is a first and probably a tad insane ðŸ™‚

A few houses, a church, and below the road, under the street, the terraces of the graveyard. Well, I guess when you're dead, you don't particularly care where you rest, but anyway, what a place!

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/walkabouts/up_in_the_graveyard.html">Up In the Graveyard</a>" from the 1994 Walkabouts album "Setting the Woods on Fire". I couldn't find it on YouTube, thus I have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga_XyVC_qsQ">uploaded it myself</a>.
