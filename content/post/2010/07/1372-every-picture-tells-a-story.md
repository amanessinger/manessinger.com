With quite some confidence and without much pleasure I can announce, that there will be no SoFoBoMo 2010 book from me. It's not that don't have the material, it's not that I have technical problems, it's simply that I run out of time. I have to choose between making a SoFoBoMo 2010 book and making the book that I want to make. I choose the latter.

Thus: There will be a book, the working title is "Sediments", it is about a layering of disconnected pieces of culture above each other, about how that creates the reality that we live in, but creating such a book takes time.

At the moment I have between 20 and 25 images from Italy that I feel belong into the book. That's not enough for SoFoBoMo, 35 would be the lower limit, and not all of them are processed to a final form. A book has requirements different from those of a blog. This year, just as with my first book, <a target="_blank" href="http://issuu.com/amanessinger/docs/tscheppaschlucht?mode=embed&documentId=080615094752-71bb975bcb574a92a12e8b84cc696d08&layout=grey">Tscheppaschlucht</a>, a great deal of work runs into homogenizing the processing styles of the images.

This is the post for Saturday, an unbearably hot day, that I used to sweat on construction sites, and the few photos that I made, were images of an apartment that had been offered to us.

It was so hot, I didn't even go swimming. I spent the rest of the day in front of my computer, re-processing images already processed weeks before, some of them not yet published. And just as with Friday's image of <a target="_blank" href="/2010/07/1371-the-gate.html">the hidden gate</a>, every picture tells a story. Sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you need to listen, give up for a day, listen again.

 This particular image is such a case. Here it was mostly a matter of finding out what spoke to me in the first place, and then cropping to the core. This originally was a vertical format, and while much spoke for it, what remains is a wide-screen horizontal. I was unhappy with the former, I am very satisfied with this one.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rod_stewart/every_picture_tells_a_story.html">Every Picture Tells A Story</a>" by Rod Steward. I have it on the 1993 album "Unplugged....And Seated". Hear the original version from the album of the same name on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhemoVkL9LQ">YouTube</a>.
