Time passes. Let's see: I started my <a target="_blank" href="http://sofobomo.org/">SoFoBoMo 2010</a> month on June 19, the day we arrived in Italy. A poor choice, I have only one or two usable images from that day, but that's how it is. I have to finish on July 20, that's a Tuesday, and for all practical reasons this means the Sunday before. It's not real tight, but I don't have so many images processed yet, I have not even a full list of candidates. I can't let it trickle an image a day, I really have to speed up. We'll see.

This is the post for Sunday, July 4, the image is again from June 20. The place is again Lavagna. Currently I don't put much energy into photography. I have images for Monday and Tuesday (back in Vienna), but only a few, and if by chance I fail to produce an image a day in the next two weeks, I won't complain. There should be enough material from Italy, that I have to process anyway.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_weller/time_passes.html">Time Passes</a>" from Paul Weller's 1995 album "Stanley Road". See him perform live on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq6Xt24RvZ0">YouTube</a>.
