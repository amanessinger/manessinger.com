Remember my little riddle from Sunday, when in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/07/1380-i-may-be-wrong.html">1380 - I May Be Wrong</a>" I suggested that my post-processing of that image from Rapallo had broken the laws of physics? 

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sanatan">Sanatan</a> commented <blockquote>I think the sun wasnâ€™t in the frame when you took the photo judging by the shadows. The street is in shadow, I think the sun was actually behind the building on he right.</blockquote>And that's correct. While post-processing, when I looked at the image, I had the feeling, that a little more sun would be beneficial. I used a masked Exposure adjustment layer, and with a soft brush I faked a sun behind the lamp post. I was prepared to remove it, I just wanted to see how it looks, but surprisingly it fit the mood and looked not even that wrong, so I kept it. Judging by your reactions, I may have been right.

 Today's image, for a change, is an image of, well, today. Like with most images of the last weeks, post-processing is on the heavy side, making use of Topaz Adjust 4 among many other weapons. In total this image is a 24 layer affair.

Strange: sometimes I have at least as much fun in Photoshop as I have photographing. Now is such a time ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/one_day_goodbye_will_be_farewell.html">One Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell</a>" from Morrissey's 2009 album "Years Of Refusal".
