No pictures from Italy today, but at least I'll catch up and post three posts. Hmm ... bloggers have the same problem as the railway companies: you can't be early, you can only be be late ðŸ™‚

Here's a bike on a car, seemingly ready to leave the city.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/curtis_mayfield/people_get_ready.html">People Get Ready</a>", and as much as I like Rod Steward's version from his "MTV Unplugged" album, the Housemartins win anytime. Let me raise my glass to the genius that is Paul Heaton!

YouTube didn't have it, so I'll have to <a target="_blank" href="http://mp3.xalo.vn/nghebaihat/333899983369/People-Get-Ready~The-Housemartins.html">send you to Vietnam</a> in order to hear British music. How ironic. Enjoy ðŸ™‚
