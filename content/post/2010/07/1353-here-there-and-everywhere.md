I don't know if I have enough material for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sofobomo.org/">SoFoBoMo 2010</a> book that <a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted Byrne</a> asked me to make. Sure, I have a lot of images, and when, back home, I go through Villach, as I did last Sunday, when that image was taken, I see those juxtapositions of old and new, those layers, those sediments, here as well. They are everywhere, and maybe in Italy they are a little more obvious than elsewhere. But then, it won't do to begin mixing things up. It's either all Italy for the book, or there will be no book at all.

 I knew I would be struggling, and I do. But at least I may catch up with my blog posts a little faster now ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/here_there_everywhere.html">Here, There And Everywhere</a>" from the Beatles album "Revolver". On Amazon it's still only available as CD, thus I link to plastic. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8THouU576WY">YouTube</a> has it as well.
