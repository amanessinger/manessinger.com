I was not in a photographing mood. I did take photographs today, a lot even, but almost all of them were textures. Walls, stone, cracking paint and the like. When I made yesterday's "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/07/1381-i-see-a-darkness.html">1381 - I See A Darkness</a>", I blended in a texture of cracks in a big block of wood, and while I browsed my collection for textures, I realized that they were not only poorly tagged in the database, but also that I don't have as many as I thought. This averted my view today and made me mostly look at old walls ðŸ™‚

OK, that's today's excuse for why you get another picture from Italy ðŸ˜„

 Here is Camogli again, same place as yesterday's darkness, same time, only here I use the 17-50 and look towards "Santa Maria Assunta", St Mary's, the church directly at the beach.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tori_amos/marys_of_the_sea.html">Marys Of The Sea</a>" from Tori Amos' 2005 album "The Beekeeper". Only live versions float the net, so here is one on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r-wP1wBHUw">YouTube</a>.
