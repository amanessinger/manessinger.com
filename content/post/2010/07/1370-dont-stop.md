One more image, this one is from today. Sometimes I really love my 70-300 and the compression at that focal length. How wonderful must a 400/2.8 be?

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/fleetwood_mac/dont_stop.html">Don't Stop</a>" from the 1977 Fleetwood Mac album "Rumours". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9BtLRWbkmA">YouTube</a>.
