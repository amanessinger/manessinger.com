I'm on the train to Carinthia, it's Friday afternoon, these are the images for yesterday, and these are also the images that I meant, when I <a target="_blank" href="http://markus-spring.info/wp/2010/07/not-a-sofobomo-book-budapest-fringe-time/">commented on Markus Spring's blog</a>. For his NotSoFoBoMo book (just as I, he failed the deadline this year), he had taken images in Budapest, Hungary, and a good part of them were doors. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100722_083956_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100722_083956_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I found it really funny when I saw his book on a day, when coincidentally I myself had photographed almost nothing but doors.

Here are only two of my images. I had many more of the same, nothing really outstanding, so I spare you the rest. Nevertheless, it made me chuckle ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Door Peep" from SinÃ©ad O'Connor's 2005 reggae music cover album "Throw Down Your Arms". I have used it ages ago in "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/11/392-door-peep-shall-not-enter.html">392 â€“ Door Peep Shall Not Enter</a>", here it is one more time, this time with a music sample on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbrMiCPcsHs">YouTube</a>.
