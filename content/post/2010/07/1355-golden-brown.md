Tuesday. I haven't been very productive this week, mostly trying to get some order into my images from Italy.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100629_201156_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100629_201156_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Still, I made some images, and this is again an experiment with the Nikon 70-300 VR.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100629_200859_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100629_200859_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's quite simple: put it to 300 mm and point it right into the middle of some grass, always towards the setting sun. These images, for example, were all made around 8:15 pm. 

Now manually scan through the focus range ... and enjoy the endless variety. Success rates are not skyrocketing, but who cares? That's what digital cameras are for ðŸ™‚
