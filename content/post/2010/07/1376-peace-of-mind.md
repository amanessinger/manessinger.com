This image calms me, and - honestly - I need it. I had a rather hard two days. I'm teaching the technology that I wrote my recent programming tutorial about, <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/">Eclipse / GlassFish / Java EE 6</a>, and whenever I do that, teaching something that I've already written about, I find that the the two kinds of knowledge transfer require slightly different orders of presentation, especially with small groups and an arrangement, where you accept questions at any time. Not that anything went wrong, to the contrary, but it is very stressful, accordingly I am behind with my posts as well.

This is the post for Wednesday, actually made that day, and this is not what I wrote about in a comment to Markus Spring's "<a target="_blank" href="http://markus-spring.info/wp/2010/07/not-a-sofobomo-book-budapest-fringe-time/">Not a SoFoBoMo</a>" success post. Here we have a house entrance as well, but in that case it was the only one that day. The multiply entrances post will be the next one.

 As I said, I find this image calming. I have no idea who the guy with the flute is, there is a woman in the same style over the next door. Greek or Roman mythology I suppose, and I am notoriously bad at both.

Anyway. What this image induces in me is some "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bb_king/peace_of_mind.html">Piece Of Mind</a>", and that is also the Song of the Day. You hear it on B. B. King's 2000 album "Makin' Love Is Good For You" (which is certainly true), or else in a wonderful live performance on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuOQF0x-I-w">YouTube</a>.
