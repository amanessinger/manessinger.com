I'm back in Vienna. And no, I didn't take any images. I made one though.

Do you remember <a target="_blank" href="/2010/06/1349-how-long-has-this-been-going-on.html">Camogli</a>? This light-flooded dream of every photographer? 

 Don't ask me what I thought, don't ask me how I feel. I'm fine ðŸ™‚ I just had the desire to experiment, and to be honest, I like what I got. Beautiful Camogli, cracking and molding.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/johnny_cash/i_see_a_darkness.html">I See A Darkness</a>" by Johnny Cash. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h04I5MtuOMw">YouTube</a>.
