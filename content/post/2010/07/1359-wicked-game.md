Allow me please to make an indecent proposal. 

As we all know, fame and fortune are a direct and automatic consequence of merit, right? Just work hard, be good, and it will be recognized, yes? No? 

Well, probably it is not just that automatic, probably at times we need to help Fortuna along, take her by the hand, lead her in the right direction. I suppose this is such a time ðŸ™‚

Yesterday night (yeah, yeah, this is supposed to be the blog post for Saturday, and now it's already Tuesday morning again, I'm late, I know), after only about three months, I have finished my <a target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/2010/04/06/6-an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-cookbook/">Eclipse / GlassFish / Java EE 6 Cookbook</a>, a blog post on my <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">Programming</a> blog. Being here for photography, most of you won't be interested in it. Still, it's a damn fine tutorial about a topic that is not broadly covered. It's comprehensive, well researched and would print to about 80 pages. That's not shabby. It needs exposure though.

May I make an indecent proposal?

Could we perhaps play a game together? The wicked game of creating public interest? Even when Java programming is probably the thing that interests you the least, may I beg you to <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/2010/04/06/6-an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-cookbook/">go to my tutorial</a>, scroll down to the very bottom and use one of those icons, to share my tutorial on Facebook, to digg it, to stumble it, set bookmarks on Google, Yahoo or Delicious, whatever you use, whatever you happen to have logins for. It would drive users from those social bookmarking sites to my tutorial, some may return later, and that would greatly help in building an audience for this fledgling blog of mine.

 Of course this is a little bit dishonest, this is tricking the game, but on the other hand, this is just what advertising does to us all the time, and I don't even sell something, to the contrary, I'm giving away a compendium of my experience ... for free. Thanks a lot for considering.

The Image of the Day is from June 20 and was taken in Lavagna, Liguria, Italy, just the next town north of where we stayed. I didn't take any images on Saturday. The Song of the Day is of course "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/chris_isaak/wicked_game.html">Wicked Game</a>" by Chris Isaak.
