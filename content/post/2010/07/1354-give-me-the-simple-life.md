On Monday I had business near our old home, in the country (not that it's far from where we live now), and of course I had the camera with me and took some images.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100628_113028_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100628_113028_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> There would probably be at least two more that I were inclined to use under normal circumstances, but excuse me please, I'm in a hurry to catch up ðŸ™‚

 The Song of The Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/give_me_the_simple_life.html">Give Me The Simple Life</a>". I have it on "Twelve Nights In Hollywood", the recently published collection of four CDs with previously unpublished material, those "Twelve Nights In Hollywood", that were the first music, that I bought as digital downloads only.

YouTube has a later version from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX7nDBjQ98Y">Montreux 1969</a>, but it is very similar in phrasing, it won't make that much of a difference.
