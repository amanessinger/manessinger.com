I'm still on the train, it's still late Friday afternoon, I have just crossed the border to Carinthia. It's raining, but towards Villach the sky is already blue again. Still, we seem to get some cooler weather now. In a way it's welcome, but then, I love summer and I know I will hate seeing it end ðŸ™‚

Wow, it's beautiful outside. You know how that looks, with dark clouds above you and the sun almost coming out near the horizon, with a very bright fringe on the clouds and a warm, indirect light coming from the west. Tolkienesque ðŸ™‚

 This is really a snapshot. I saw the biker coming from the corner of my eye, I raised the camera, all within a split-second, no time to compose, no time to change any settings, but actually I like the result, or let's say, for a Friday it's OK.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/you_gotta_move.html">You Gotta Move</a>" from the 1971 Rolling Stones album "Sticky Fingers". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAMPi45yFdY">YouTube</a>.

Oh, and the light is totally unreal outside. No chance to take images though ðŸ˜„
