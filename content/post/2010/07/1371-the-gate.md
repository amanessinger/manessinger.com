A house was torn down. It happened sometime in winter, I saw it, took some photos, and for months now I have taken images at that place. Only every few weeks, but again and again. One of them even made it (see "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/05/1323-there-she-goes-my-beautiful-world.html">1323 - There She Goes, My Beautiful World</a>"), but on average they were rubbish. I could simply have given up, but in such cases I frequently see a certain quality in a scene, a quality that attracts me, but I can't necessarily explain what it is. Sometimes it is a detail, and often this detail can't strictly be photographed. My mind isolates it and in my mind it it stands out to a degree, that light and reality can't support.

I am not sure if it was always this gate, that has fascinated me, but today, when I took this image this morning, today I am sure it was.

Photoshop-wise I have used lots of "Fill light" and "Recover" in Camera RAW, Topaz Adjust's "Spicify" filter, partially applied with a mask, but the real interesting thing was a "B+W/Blue"  adjustment layer, that I put in "Difference" mode. That's a cool combination, all the B+W filters produce different results, and I could have worked in many different directions. This was one that I really, really liked. Sometimes it's a good idea to just fool around and see what happens ðŸ˜„

 Is this a SoFoBoMo image? Maybe. I had planned to strictly use images from Italy, but I may make exceptions.
