It's Tuesday night, this is the entry for Monday. It's the same image as in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/06/1346-someday-after-a-while.html">1346 - Someday After A While</a>", processed differently, along with another image of the same house, taken the next day at noon. I suppose I will use these two images together on a spread, and while the first one was always meant to be on the title page, I think the second would be nice for the back cover.

Hmm ... well, maybe it's a bit premature to talk about covers, as long as I don't have an idea what to put in between ðŸ˜„

 Have you ever searched Amazon's MP3 search for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music&field-keywords=both+sides+now&ie=UTF8&tag=thedailphotof-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00008PT1H">"Both Sides Now"</a>? Can you believe this? This <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joni_mitchell/both_sides_now.html">Joni Mitchell song</a> may easily be the most covered song of all times, and if it is not, it can't fall short ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is a version from the 2003 album "Undercovers" by Maria JoÃ£o and MÃ¡rio Laginha. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsN1IzaVklE">YouTube</a>.
