Today I left home very early, at least compared to my usual habits. It was about 6:15 am, and the sun stood at an angle that I went almost the whole way in shadows. The other thing is, it's Friday, traveling day, thus I didn't expect to have an image at all. This one just happened at the last crossing. I saw the runner take over, saw the blinding sun, and without looking through the viewfinder, while walking even, I took two exposures.

Of course with that much light, even at f8, the shutter speed was high enough to freeze any motion, and when I looked at the image, I really liked what I saw and decided to work on it.

 Regarding SoFoBoMo, I really don't know if I can do it within the remaining week. At the moment I suppose rather not, but this does not mean that I strictly rule it out. Let's see.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/corrs/runaway.html">Runaway</a>" from the 1999 "MTV Unplugged"
album by The Corrs. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A87Mqo_yDV4">YouTube</a>.
