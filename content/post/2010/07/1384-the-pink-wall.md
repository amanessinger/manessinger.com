I'm still without my Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC -  and I miss it. It's such a versatile lens, and if it were actually working, it would be perfect ðŸ™‚

Well, I guess it will take at least another week until I get it back from repair. Until then I use lenses that I've not used in a long time. We had the Sigma 50/1.4 last week, we had a few images with the Nikon 70-300 VR, and at the moment it is the Sigma 28/1.8, another fine lens that's just a little wider than normal on my D300. I've even tried the Sigma 8-16, but ultra-wide is not my thing right now.

My programming blog finally gets quite some traffic, and that is an interesting thing. It's a low-volume blog where I publish very selectively. There is almost nothing personal, it's mostly short essays about software, about programming, and then there is this really <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/tutorials/an-eclipse-glassfish-java-ee-6-tutorial/">huge tutorial</a> that I've written. Obviously it is not that bad, because in the meantime it got linked to from Sun/Oracle, it was recognized by the very developers of the software that I write about, and in Google you find it on the first page when you search for "GlassFish", "Eclipse" and "tutorial".

This tutorial and the followup, where I looked into what has changed with the recent software updates, draw almost all the traffic, and that amounts to pretty much the same as my photoblog. Cool ðŸ™‚

I have announced the tutorial on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.good-tutorials.com/">Good-Tutorials.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pixel2life.com/">Pixel2Life.com</a>, two tutorial sites that bring in some traffic as well, but on the other hand, stumbling the tutorial is absolutely ineffective. Why? Too much text, too specific. If you're looking for it, it's exactly what you need, but if not, you couldn't care less.

 Bounce rates are lower as well and in general people tend to browse around. It's also interesting that the tutorial draws a constant stream of visitors, and it has been doing this for more than three weeks now. When I do the same thing on my photoblog, publish a tutorial and announce it, I get a spike for about two or three days and then it's over. Funny how different blog categories behave differently ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/juicy_john_pink.html">Juicy John Pink</a>" from the 1969 Procol Harum classic "A Salty Dog". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yVxL0s3R3M">YouTube</a>. Hmm ... couldn't remember this song at all ðŸ˜„
