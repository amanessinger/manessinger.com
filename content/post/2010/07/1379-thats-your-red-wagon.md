It's Saturday, we had a cool, mostly cloudy day and I have done ... nothing. Therefore I can only offer you another image from Italy, taken in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Margherita_Ligure">Santa Margherita Ligure</a>, and to be precise <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&q=rapallo&oe=utf-8&ie=UTF8&ei=D0VLTNOBDoKaOKLFuJUD&ved=0CBoQ_AU&hq=&hnear=Rapallo+Genoa,+Liguria,+Italy&ll=44.328975,9.214541&spn=0.003611,0.008256&t=h&z=18&layer=c&cbll=44.329019,9.214423&panoid=mIjX75nqm18bcuHjkMD-8w&cbp=12,76.49,,0,5">exactly here</a>. Oh dear, Street View is probably one of the most useful applications ever ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day, "That's Your Red Wagon" by Anita O'Day and Cal Tjader, released on their 1962 album "Time For 2", was not available online, thus I have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqFWyfNw43k">uploaded it to YouTube</a>. Great song, great album, and the latin touch harmonizes perfectly with Anita's relaxed style.
