It's Sunday night, already past midnight. I am still in Carinthia because we were in Graz today, about 150 km from Villach, capital of the neighboring province of Styria. We were there for a concert and scenic interpretation of Claudio Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals. The "Combattimento" performed live, how much better can it get? Needless to say, it was fantastic.

There's nothing new on the photography front. I made some images, though I have not even copied them from the camera yet. Maybe I would have had something anyway, but here is one more image from Italy instead.

The funny thing is, during post-processing I did something that I normally don't do: I deliberately introduced an error. This image is not real. It can't be. No, it's not the processing style, of course the colors, the local contrasts, the partial blur, all that are not "real", but then what is? No, I mean something else. Can you see it?

 But then, even though I broke the laws of physics, this image looks exactly like what I remember. In fact it does much more so than all the images that I took in this district of Rapallo.

The Song of the Day is "I May Be Wrong" by Chick Webb and his Orchestra. I have it on Disc 132 of "The Ultimate Jazz Archive". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEdCn6C4gQ4">YouTube</a>.
