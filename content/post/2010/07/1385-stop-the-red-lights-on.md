It's Friday, I'm on the train to Carinthia and I am really tired from a stressful day. This is an image that I took in the morning. It was raining, you see my umbrella.

 The Song of the Day is "Stop! The Red Light's On" by Gene Krupa and Anita O'Day. I absolutely love that woman ðŸ™‚

Don't forget to hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhnrNQ2zYjI">YouTube</a>!
