Well, it's past midnight, technically it's already the first of June and that means it's <a target="_blank" href="http://sofobomo.org/">SoFoBoMo</a>. There is an all new web site, but the rules are still the same: at least 35 images, taken within a 31 days window during June and July, the result being a book, complete with layout, uploaded as PDF.

I did it two times so far, I'll do it again this year and - honestly - I have not a clue what it will be.

Technically I suppose it's easy. I intend to use exactly the template from last year, maybe change some details, but it worked for me and I see no reason to deviate.

The images? Well, in two weeks I'll be in Italy. Genova and the Ligurian Riviera. If I find nothing better, I guess I'll make a travel book, and if that does not work, I have still a month to find something else. No need to panic ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/thats_life_i_guess.html">That's Life I Guess</a>" by Billie Holiday. Amazon has a nice collection of the Complete Columbia Recordings, 230 songs for the very civil amount of $15.98. I just downloaded them. I guess I must have had most of them anyway, but it was just a too good price to pass ðŸ˜„
