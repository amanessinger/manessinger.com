This is not an image of yesterday. Mind you, I made one, a single one, but you don't want to see it. It's all mud and rain.

Instead of taking photographs, I just spent time working on my programming blog, adding to that mystical tome, my much hinted at and never seen Java Enterprise Edition 6 tutorial. Any day now, any day ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/corrs/old_town.html">Old Town</a>" from the Corrs' 1999 "MTV Unplugged" album. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5DF-l7sVrI">YouTube</a> has the video.

Oh, in case you want to know, this image was taken on Tuesday in the old parts of Villach. Same walk as "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/06/1341-come-home.html">1341 â€“ Come Home</a>".
