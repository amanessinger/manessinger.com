Today was the second day that I went down to the field and took a long series of images. I can happily say, that after around 50 images I finally got something that I like enough to put it up on the blog ðŸ˜„

At the moment it is relatively cool, tomorrow we'll finally drive down to Italy. Weather is still unstable, but at least from Monday or Tuesday till the end of the week it is supposed to get really sunny.

It's unfortunate that we had to skip Genova, because I already had a plan for how to tackle it photographically, and four days in that city would probably have given me enough material for this year's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sofobomo.org/">SoFoBoMo</a>. 

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/shine_a_light.html">Shine A Light</a>" from the 1972 Rolling Stones album "Exile On Main Street". It was recently re-issued, and I can only tell you, do yourself the favor and get the "Deluxe Edition" that I have linked to, if for nothing else then at least for the wonderful ballad "Following The River". Great stuff.

As to the Song of the Day, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPbozLRU3so">YouTube</a> has it.

<em>May the good lord shine a light on you
Warm like the evening sun</em>
