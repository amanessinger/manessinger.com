Hmm ... I seem to be having real fun with that damn Tamron again, at least judging by the fact that since I got it back, I used it all the time but one single day ðŸ™‚

 And what can I say? It behaves like there had never been any problems. The aperture not closing upon release? Not any more! Focus problems? None at all! It must feel the hot breath of that new Sigma 17-50/2.8 on its neck ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is from another one of my new albums, Bettye LaVette's very different rendition of the Pink Floyd standard "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pink_floyd/wish_you_were_here.html">Wish You Were Here</a>". YouTube has the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzyglUWa0ok&feature=related">album version</a>, and there's also an excellent quality <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmIPbaFBlII">live performance</a>. Don't forget to switch to HD if you're on a reasonably fast connection.
