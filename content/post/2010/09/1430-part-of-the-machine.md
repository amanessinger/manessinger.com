This is an image I took on today's walk to work. I was in a hurry and I almost shot it while walking. Framing was more subconscious than anything else, but the corners turned out pretty satisfyingly. I just needed to raise the left upper corner with Photoshop's "Transform / Skew" by a fraction of a smidge and it was perfect ðŸ˜„

 As light was flat and particularly unspectacular, I've helped along with a combo of Topaz Adjust ("Spicify"), Topaz Detail ("Soften"), a neutral blur, a vignette and who knows what else. In the end I pretty like the result.

By the way, this is something I use a lot lately: the Topaz tool range to increase definition in the middle tones, basically increasing local contrast in various ways, also locally via masks, and then countering the effect with a neutral blur (explained somewhere in the middle of "<a target="_blank" href="/2008/04/542-show-is-over-say-good-bye.html">542 - The Show Is Over, Say Good-Bye</a>"), giving back some smoothness and depth.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/part_of_the_machine.html">Part Of The Machine</a>" from the 1987 Jethro Tull album "Crest of a Knave". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KoD801jYzI">YouTube</a>.
