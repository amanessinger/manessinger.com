No, it's sunny now, but I was not outside. Instead of something from today, let me give you one more image from Italy. This is La Spezia. The image is from the series that should have been a SoFoBoMo 2010 book and that may one day end up as a book nevertheless.

 The Song of the Day is "Goin' Over The Hill" from the 2002 album "The Willy DeVille Acoustic Trio In Berlin". See a video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZR_dLzFFSk">YouTube</a>. And now please excuse me, I'd like to have a glass of Prosecco on the balcony ðŸ™‚
