Today I'm glad that I have an image at all. It's Friday, in the morning I was in a hurry, and after work I had to get to the train. That's where I am now, trying to recover ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day could as well have been Michael Jackson's "Bad", but as I don't have it, I had to resort to "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dreamgirls/steppin_to_the_bad_side.html">Steppin' to the Bad Side</a>" from the soundtrack to "Dreamgirls". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdRlHvulIHM">YouTube</a> has it.
