"Gratis Ã„pfel" - "apples for free" - on the sidewalk in front of a shop. I took this image yesterday morning. I could resist the apples though.

 Instead of processing images and making blog posts, I spent the whole evening browsing Amazon for new music. One of the results is that I bought four albums by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_of_Crime">Element Of Crime</a>.

The Song of the Day is on one of them. It's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/element_of_crime/alten_resten_eine_chance.html">Alten Resten Eine Chance</a>" ("a chance to old leftovers") from the 1993 album "Weisses Papier". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81QJX40Sg10">YouTube</a>.
