A stupid title and no connection to the image? Oh yes, you're right, but then ... I sat there in Klagenfurt, in front of a pub called <a href="http://www.pavlvs.at/">Pavlvs</a>, drank my mineral water with lemon juice, and while the sun burned down, I looked up along the modern facade, up into the sky, and for a short moment everything was perfect ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Linger Awhile" by Sarah Vaughn. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u74_uIhMPRM">YouTube</a> has a 1953 recording with orchestra, not bad, but I still prefer the version from the 1957 album "Swingin' Easy".
