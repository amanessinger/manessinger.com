Ok, so let me conclude tonight's posting spree with a little Twig Photography ðŸ™‚

This is from today, the last sunny day for a while, it's already raining and it will continue to do so for the rest of the weekend.

 A few weeks ago, in a comment to "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/08/1407-infinite-and-unforseen.html">1407 - Infinite And Unforseen</a>", <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nobodys-domain.de/">Thomas</a> suggested an alternative title for that day's image, namely Jethro Tull's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/songs_from_the_wood.html">Songs From The Wood</a>". Interestingly enough, although I knew every song on the album, I didn't actually have it. I couldn't possibly have gone on like that, could I ðŸ™‚
