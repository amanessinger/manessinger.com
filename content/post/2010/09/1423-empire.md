As usual I am a little behind on schedule. Let me show you one image taken on Monday afternoon in the park of the imperial castle of SchÃ¶nbrunn. The building is an over-sized pavilion on top of the hill overlooking the castle. It's called "Gloriette".

 Light on Monday was brilliant, the air was clean, and so it cost me quite some work in Photoshop until I arrived at this HDR-like interpretation. It's not HDR though, it is simply one image taken through different versions from RAW, Topaz Adjust (or Detail? I can't remember) and some other tricks.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/empire.html">Empire</a>" from David Byrne's 2004 album "Grown Backwards". I've uploaded it to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wk3CKMQKoM">YouTube</a>, successfully one more time ðŸ™‚
