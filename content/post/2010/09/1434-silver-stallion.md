I'm on the train to Carinthia. It's getting dark outside, it rains, and that's what it's supposed to do for the rest of the weekend. We've got a low low-pressure area over Italy, that always means rain in the southern parts of Austria, and the most southern part of Austria is, right, Carinthia. Oh well ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cat_power/silver_stallion.html">Silver Stallion</a>" from the 2008 Cat Power album "Jukebox". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JbnDCB5ym0">YouTube</a>.
