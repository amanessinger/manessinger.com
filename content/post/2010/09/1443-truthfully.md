It's still Sunday afternoon, although the rain has stopped hours ago, it's still pretty uninviting outside, light is flat, and my desire to go out is non-existing. Thus, as already threatened, I'll give you another of yesterdays rain images.

Do you believe in "photographic truth"? Don't. It's not worth it. Life can be so much more beautiful without it ðŸ™‚

The picture on the left is what the camera saw of the scene, the picture on the right is an attempt to approximate what my eyes saw, and the Image of the Day is what I would have liked to see. Truthfully? Hope you don't care, I certainly don't ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lisa_loeb/truthfully.html">Truthfully</a>" from Lisa Loeb's 1997 album "Firecracker". YouTube has a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXl9OUjYuMc">live performance</a>.
