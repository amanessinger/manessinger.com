I really had to laugh today when I saw this advertising column with a Picasso poster, in the background there were graffiti, and it all looked somehow ... similar. So, how's that for a comment about modern art?

Only joking ðŸ™‚

Actually I value Picasso as one of the most flexible and independent artists of his time, a man who did not choose the easy way of petrification and artistic death.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_bowie/pablo_picasso.html">Pablo Picasso</a>" from the 2003 David Bowie album "Reality". YouTube has the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk2hYnPo77M">plain song</a>, and then they have a very <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSccHqk9s64">artful video</a> based on it. Enjoy.
