When I got my D300 and the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC back from repair, I was really awed by the raw speed of focusing and the enormous precision of the autofocus. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100903_074825_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100903_074825_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Try that one time: use manual focus for a few days, and preferrably do that with a manual focus lens. I have two of them now, the 50/1.2 and the 24/2.8, and both feel so enormously better when focusing than any modern AF lens, it's a pleasure to use them. Try using such lenses for a few days, then switch to a decent AF lens and feel the awe ðŸ˜„

 But then, oh my, am I slow focusing manually! On the other hand, this is part of the appeal of these lenses. They slow me down. I wouldn't use them for action, but for subjects like today's, there is nothing wrong with them.
