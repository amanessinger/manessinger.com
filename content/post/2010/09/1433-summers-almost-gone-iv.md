Same titles, year after year? Yeah, but this year I omitted "Summertime". I was an idiot to wait, after the two weeks of excessive 35+ temperatures (Celsius that is), because what followed was rain, rain and plenty of rain.

 Anyway. It's not a proper picture what I have here, it's just a token of my last afternoon's pleasure while sitting in front of an inn and enjoying the last rays of the sun, while having a glass of wine.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/doors/summers_almost_gone.html">Summer's Almost Gone</a>" from the 1968 Doors album “Waiting for the Sun”, just like <a target="_blank" href="/2009/09/1072-summers-almost-gone-iii.html">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/2008/09/699-summers-almost-gone-ii.html">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/2007/09/344-summers-almost-gone.html">here</a>.
