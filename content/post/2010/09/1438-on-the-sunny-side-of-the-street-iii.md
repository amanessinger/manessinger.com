Here is another image shot into the sun. It's interesting, when lenses are tested, you often hear something like "... unless you take an image with the sun in your frame", as if this were something unusual. It's not. Definitely not for me. I love this kind of images.

Of course it's moot to try to let the sun not burn out. It always does, but then, there's nothing wrong with it. The problem is mostly the enormous contrast, but blending different versions from RAW is normally a good start.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/on_the_sunny_side_of_the_street.html">On The Sunny Side Of The Street</a>". We had <a target="_blank" href="/2007/08/312-back-to-sunny-side.html">Roberta Gamberini</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/2007/03/145-life-can-be-so-sweet.html">Cyndi Lauper</a> (Nobody else? Incredible, but that's what my lists say), so let's try Lionel Hampton today. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpjSRjAkMdM&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
