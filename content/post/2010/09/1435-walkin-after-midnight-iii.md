No no, although this image is from Vienna, I am in Carinthia at the moment. The image is a left-over from Tuesday, and I processed it without really wanting to use it, just to see how it would look. In the end, when I found that it wasn't so bad, I decided to keep it. Well, you know, weather is just as it was predicted ðŸ™‚

In the moment it is Sunday afternoon, sun just came out, I may probably go out and drive a round.

 But, back to this image, you see, it's the second B&amp;W image in a row, and that's for a reason. Just some days ago Mark Segal has published a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/software/superb_black_and_white_with_nik_silver_efex_pro.shtml">review of Nik Software's Silver Efex Pro</a> on The Luminous Landscape.

Hmm ... it's tempting, really, it is. Maybe I am not so without wishes as I thought ðŸ˜„

 So far we had versions of "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cowboy_junkies/walking_after_midnight_live.html">Walkin' After Midnight</a>" by <a target="_blank" href="/2008/12/788-walking-after-midnight.html">The Cowboy Junkies</a> (thanks again Bill!!) and by <a target="_blank" href="/2008/12/794-walking-after-midnight-ii.html">Madeleine Peyroux</a>, and today's version is by one of my all-time favorite groups, Fairground Attraction. 

It's from their second album "Ay Fond Kiss", the last album before their split, and the album is not available for digital download. I suggest you get the first album, "The First Of A Million Kisses" instead (alone for the iconic cover), and fill your collection up with the non-duplicates from "The Very Best Of Fairground Attraction". YouTube has them <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgwO54UoqKE">live in 1988</a>.
