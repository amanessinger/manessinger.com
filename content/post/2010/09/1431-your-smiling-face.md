I'm pretty sure we had that girl a few times. I would have expected her under the label "<a target="_blank"  href="/tag/mannequin">Mannequin</a>", but there ain't nothing.

 Anyway. This is in the window of an interesting shop in LerchenfelderstraÃŸe. They sell all sorts of old things, and for instance they gave us this old <a href="/2008/11/775-long-distance-call.html">telephone</a>. OK, here I found it: "<a target="_blank" href="/2008/11/761-carry-on-regardless.html">761 - Carry On Regardless</a>". I had forgotten to label it properly ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank"  href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/james_taylor/your_smiling_face.html">Your Smiling Face</a>" from the 1998 self-titled Dakota Moon debut album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCkc9jY4VSo">YouTube</a>. It's a cover of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ELw2Cp-F3s">this James Taylor song</a>.
