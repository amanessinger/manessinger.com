Three days without update? I was lazy. Sorry, I can offer no other excuse ðŸ™‚

Let's try to get back to synchronicity real fast, shall we? This is an image from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wels">Wels</a>, a small town of pre-Roman origin in Upper Austria. We were there at a fair, and this is an image from the main square. It's a variation on the last days' "Shooting into the Sun" theme, this time it is right behind the glass of the street light.

 The Song of the Day is "A Good Old Fashioned Town" from Paul Heaton's 2008 album "The Cross Eyed Rambler". See a live performance on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOQVqcV4QRc">YouTube</a>.
