When I arrived in Vienna at 1 am, it was cold and rainy, and in the morning when I left home for work, it had just stopped drizzling. Surprisingly though, the day ended up bright and sunny. 

Sitting in the sun, I had a glass of Pinot Grigio in front of a bar in Mariahilfer StraÃŸe, not Vienna's most exclusive shopping street, rather the most inclusive and the most lively. That's where I took the Image of the Day.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/thats_how_people_grow_up.html">That's How People Grow Up</a>" from Morrissey's 2009 album "Years Of Refusal". YouTube has the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPij63mSH30">official video</a> and Dailymotion has it even in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x42iv4_morrissey-thats-how-people-grow-up_music">correct aspect ratio</a> ðŸ™‚
