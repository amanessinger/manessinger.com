Let's say it was a typical Sunday. I was lazy and didn't even go out to take pictures. Here is another one from Italy, <a target="_blank" href="/2010/07/1350-the-marvel-of-marble.html">again from Colonnata</a>, the small village in the mountains of Carrara, where we ate that wonderfully tender white bacon called <atarget="_blank"  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lardo_di_Colonnata">Lardo di Colonnata</a>.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_nutini/simple_things.html">Simple Things</a>" by Paolo Nutini. In "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/09/1068-simple-things.html">1068 â€“ Simple Things</a>" I already used that title, but then the Song was by The Crash. Here's Paolo Nutini on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMYeypmN0Zc">YouTube</a>. Despite his Italian name he is a Scotsman, and despite his young age of 20 at the time when the album was released, he is an excellent singer, backed by excellent musicians. Amazing!
