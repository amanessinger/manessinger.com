I'm still at home - and I can't even begin to tell you how fed up I am. I have made no single image since when? Sunday?? But anyway, I'll stay home tomorrow, and on Friday I'm back to work and then in the evening back to Carinthia.

Speaking of Carinthia, this is an image that I took more than a month ago on Mount Dobratsch. I didn't use it, because I had more than enough images for "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/02/1210-solid-rock.html">1210 â€“ Solid Rock</a>", but today I am thankful for it. It's also fitting in a way, because while the sun shines in Vienna, there was snowfall in Carinthia during the whole day, and it is predicted to go on until tomorrow. The weekend may see some sunshine as well. We'll see. Let's hope I'm fit for photography ðŸ™‚

 This wooden sign is by the side of the road, almost at its end, at a height of about 1700 meters. I really liked the texture in the snow. What you see here is the result of a series of experiments, directed at conserving the highlight detail and the general feeling of depth, and at the same time showing a kind of blinding brightness. Thus I had to be careful: too much local contrast would have pushed the whole image into a medium gray, and that's far from what I experienced while I was there. All in all I think the result is OK.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/alone.html">Alone</a>" from the 1996 Beautiful South album "Blue Is The Colour". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHI7O5uNrPQ">YouTube</a>. Not exactly related to the image, but a great song like almost all of Paul Heaton's ðŸ™‚
