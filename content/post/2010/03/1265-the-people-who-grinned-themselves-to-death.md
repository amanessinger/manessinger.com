Having lost the stabilized 17-50/2.8 feels ... exciting. I almost have not used any other lens since November 6 when I bought the Tammy, and now that I must, I begin to change frequently again. I absolutely love it.

This is a still-life from the window of some esoteric shop here in Vienna's 7<sup>th</sup> district, the only place in Austria where the Green Party rules. In a way this is the most impossible place in Austria, our very own San Francisco ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is Paul Heaton's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/h/housemartins/the_people_who_grinned_themselves_to_death.html">The People Who Grinned Themselves To Death</a>". Heaton was then, in 1987, lead singer of The Housemartins, the same Paul Heaton who later was The Beautiful South. It's not the first time we had him, it won't be the last time. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFrCHtvefmU">YouTube</a> has the song.
