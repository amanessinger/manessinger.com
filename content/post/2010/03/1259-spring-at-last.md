It's wonderful when it gets warm. At the moment the days are sunny, it may get bad over the weekend though. Oh well ðŸ™‚

Yesterday morning I checked that little square with the fountain, a place that I normally ignore, but on the other side of the street, you can't see it here, is a tree that blossoms very early and in the most spectacular pink. Year after year I am too late, thus I went there yesterday. It's still too early though, there is no trace of blossoms at all yet.

 The Song of the Day is "Spring (At Last)" from Paul Weller's 2003 album "Illumination". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFGq9JPJNpY">YouTube</a>.
