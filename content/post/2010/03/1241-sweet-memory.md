This may seem like another "so-what" image, and in a certain way it is. Actually it is not a real image - meaning an image that I'm proud of - at all. It's a memory, and to be precise, it's a future memory.

This is of course the morning view from my study in Carinthia again. It's not particularly interesting, just a morning, and during the last 17 months (so long have we been in Villach ... so long), I have shown you many versions of this view, some of them maybe even good.

This is all going to fade away. Nothing will remain but a sweet memory.

See the red and white ribbons? They are all over the place, marking the outlines of furture buildings. So far they are nothing but a nuisance, making a lot of noise when the wind rushes in, but I suppose it's only a matter of weeks until the bulldozers come.

 It fills me with a certain nostalgia to know that this place will never again be what I have learned to love. But then: that's life ðŸ™‚
