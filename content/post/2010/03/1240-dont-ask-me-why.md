That's gonna be a short one, promised ðŸ™‚

The image is one more from yesterday morning. Actually, yesterday's two images and today's one were taken in sequence. 

Hmm ... why this image? Don't ask me. It somehow appeals to me. Maybe it tells a story. Maybe not. You decide ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eurythmics/dont_ask_me_why.html">Don't Ask Me Why</a>" from the 1989 Eurythmics album "We Too Are One". <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXcQQ21D_0k">YouTube</a> has the video.
