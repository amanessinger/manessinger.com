I'm back in Vienna, but I'm sick and at home. I've slept most of the day, and although I made a few images out of the window this morning, I'll spare you the results.

These two images were both taken last week on the same day as "<a href="/2010/03/1237-im-gonna-lock-my-heart.html">1237 – I’m Gonna Lock My Heart</a>". The first image is actually a failure. I probably should go back and try it again. The problem is, that I took two exposures with that walking man in the frame, one too early and the other, this one, too late. I'd have liked to have him a little bit more to the left, the scene less condensed, and then I would not have been forced to crop so much in from the left. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100303_080915_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100303_080915_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I've also played with some alternative crops, for instance a square that comes in even more from the left and that also cuts part of the scribble from the right, and although it is in some ways better, it does not satisfy me in the end. So this is a failure, but it is the kind of failure that interests me.

The Image of the Day was the other option from the same day, and I'm actually glad that I could finally use it. I would have forgotten it, but I really like the various strong lines in different directions, and the feeling of depth that they create.

Other than that, I've learned something. You know, here in the heart of Europe we have a political and social system that is very different from that in the US, and we tend to see the Republicans as evil, as being against freedom. Part of that is a fact that we've talked about often with <a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted Byrne</a>, namely that we associate completely different things with "left" and "right", but especially with the political right. For me a Nazi is right, for him a Nazi fights for a system with tight governmental control, thus in his view Nazis are essentially left. Well, whatever. I guess in the meantime we have learned to appreciate each other's positions.

But that's something I had to think about, when I saw the recent <a target="_blank" href="http://a.blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip.tv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F3328859%3Freferrer%3Dhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.google.com%25252Freader%25252Fview%25252F%26source%3D3&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip.tv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer.swf&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Flessig.blip.tv%2Frss%2Fflash&brandname=lessig.blip.tv&brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Flessig.blip.tv&enablejs=true">TEDx talk</a> by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig">Lawrence Lessig</a>. I really urge you to view this talk for three reasons: 

First, I believe it carries an important message. I simply like what he says and I believe it's true. 

 Second, it is enlightening on a completely different level, because it shreds some of my deeply ingrained prejudices. Unfortunately it also proves that politics are a damn complicated field. Well, and 

Third, it is just an incredibly clever presentation. This man can really talk and this man really knows how to make a point. I heard it with interest and pleasure, hope you like it too.

The Song of the Day is one of my recent Sinatra acquisitions, the Johnny Burke / Jimmy Van Heusen composition "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/it_could_happen_to_you.html">It Could Happen To You</a>".
