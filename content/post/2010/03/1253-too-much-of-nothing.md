I took this image today, in the morning, on my way to work. I really like it, but it is one of those images that are bound to a language. "Wert" is German and means "value".

 See what I mean, this juxtaposition between the word and the way it was written?

But then, I don't really understand why those kids are doing it anyway. Maybe it was meant just like that, maybe it was not "meant" at all.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/too_much_of_nothing.html">Too Much Of Nothing</a>", and I mean the original. Bob Dylan &amp; The Band on "The Basement Tapes". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3ljv0vp-lE">YouTube</a>.
