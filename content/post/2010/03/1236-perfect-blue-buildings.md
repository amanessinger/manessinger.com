Giving titles. Even (or because of) my habit of using song titles, it can be really hard.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100302_075845_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100302_075845_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Sometimes it takes me as long as working on the image. Here I had three of them to choose, none of them a clear winner.

In the end I decided for the one that gave me a Song of the Day. Actually I would have rather taken this one: a damaged bicycle with an infinitely twisted wheel, but really, among 34000 songs, there is exactly not a single one called "Infinity".

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100302_081150_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100302_081150_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Or the other one. I would have expected "Obscure" (at least that's what I read: "Obskur") to be a word that occurs at least once in 34000 song titles. Nothing. 

Of course "Blue" was the cheap way out. 1557 songs, most of them Blues ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/counting_crows/perfect_blue_buildings.html">Perfect Blue Buildings</a>" from the 1993 Counting Crows album "August and Everything After".
