Oops! Wrong timestamps. We have daylight saving time again, but my Nikon D300 does not switch automatically. When you look at the URL of the image, it says 153032, but in fact it was 4:30 pm when I left work. Happens to me twice a year, and actually it's a scandal that those highly capable computers can't do something so simple as adding or subtracting an hour twice a year. How hard can that be? ðŸ™‚

 Other than that, I just spent obscene amounts of time weighing options for my software project. But that would really belong <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">over there</a> ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/mixed_up_confusion.html">Mixed-Up Confusion</a>", Dylan's first single, if it's true what I just read. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZLX5FaSe8A">YouTube</a>.
