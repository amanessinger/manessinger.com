Just some image I made yesterday morning. Today is rather cloudy, but yesterday was a fine spring day. This is Siebensternplatz, we had it a year ago in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/04/908-at-break-of-day.html">908 â€“ At The Break Of Day</a>", and this time it's less fishy ðŸ™‚

As regards <a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">my other blog</a>, well, it's far easier to start your second blog than it is to start the first. On this blog it took me three weeks to get my first comment (apart from a spam comment on post six), while this time Paul Lester was so friendly to comment on post zero. Thanks Paul ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Walkin'" by Miles Davis. There are many different versions, I have a 1964 live version, what I found on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YybOP5ZoGY">YouTube</a> is similar, only a tad slower.
