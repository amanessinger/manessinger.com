This is an image from yesterday afternoon. Days are longer now, and though the image is from as late as 5:16&nbsp;pm, I still caught some rays of sun. I don't know how you feel about it, but for me sunlight is so tightly coupled with life, I really feel like waking up.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/seal/my_vision.html">My Vision</a>" from the 2003 Seal album "Seal IV". See the official video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpc3lFR0AwY">YouTube</a>.
