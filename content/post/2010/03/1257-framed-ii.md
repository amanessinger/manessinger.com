I have a new blog, simply called "<a target="_blank" href="http://programming.manessinger.com/">Programming</a>". I will use it to document my thoughts about software engineering, to gather requirements for my new free software project, and to document its progress. It will take me an unspecified but in any case long time, and the result may be an amazing new technology or nothing at all. Whatever the outcome may be, I see interesting times ahead.

If you're interested in software engineering, follow me. Have a look at the currently two posts that explain what I have done in the past, and if they strike a chord with you, keep reading. I can't promise any particular posting pattern, but I will post as frequently as I have something meaningful.

At the moment I still draw from experience, so posting is no real effort, just writing and proof reading, but we will get to a point where I need to write code, and then things will slow down.

Anyway, I am determined to carry on, and if you know me, you know what that means ðŸ™‚

 If you're interested, why don't you subscribe to the feed? And if you know someone who could be interested, why don't you spread the word?

Nuff said. I took this image in the afternoon on my way home. I simply love what the extreme sidelight does.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ritchie_valens/framed.html">Framed</a>", and this time it's not Alex Harvey like in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/02/1207-framed.html">1207 â€“ Framed</a>", this time it's the Ritchie Valens song from the "La Bamba" soundtrack. See a scene from the movie on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI970jmMuQE&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
