Mittagskogel. You know this mountain, it's a landmark just south of Villach, I have had it on quite some image, but it's actually not so easy to get a good view on it.

You know, I have no real problem with power lines and such, when I can't avoid them, I make them a subject, but in order for that to work, I need to be able to choose my point of view. With still so much snow and no proper shoes (OK, this was idiotic, don't tell me ðŸ™‚), I didn't have that freedom, thus I had to look harder.

 These two images are what I came up with. Both of them are HDR, processed with Photomatix Pro, for the Image of the Day I also used a polarizer. I like both.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dido/hunter.html">Hunter</a>" from Dido's 1999 album "No Angel". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08-Oa0zvf3g">YouTube</a>.
