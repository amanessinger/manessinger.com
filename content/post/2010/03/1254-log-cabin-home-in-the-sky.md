Saturday was warm but hazy. We decided to make a trip up one of the more remote valleys in Carinthia, Lesachtal, a very rural part of the country, known for big amounts of snow.

I have no idea what this hut really is for, maybe it's for storing dry hay, maybe for something completely different. It's situated on the south-facing side of the valley, so even though it's still deep winter on the other side, here it is already spring.

 The Song of the Day is "Log Cabin Home In The Sky" from the 1968 Incredible String Band album "Wee Tam". See Robin Williamson perform it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd_QvZIlXso">live in 2009</a>. Charming, even despite those squeaking children. Or maybe just because of them. Love it ðŸ™‚
