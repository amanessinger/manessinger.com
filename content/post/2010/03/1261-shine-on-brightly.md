This is the first image of yesterday afternoon. It was a bright, sunny day and we drove around in Carinthia. The challenge: find streets you have never driven before. Sometimes I am glad we that don't have to go to another continent to find the unknown. Ten kilometers can be more than enough. You just have to keep your eyes open ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/procol_harum/shine_on_brightly.html">Shine On Brightly</a>" from the 1968 Procol Harum album of the same name. 

 I didn't find the album as digital download on Amazon, but what I found to my surprise is, that there are some recent live albums. One of them, "Live At The Union Chapel", has the song and that's what I've linked to. And then of course there's always <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E12YAuAYjLQ">YouTube</a> ðŸ™‚
