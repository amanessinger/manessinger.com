This is the Monday image. One more bicycle.

 Things go quite well with the new blog. I have two big posts up now, I guess I'll announce it any time now ðŸ™‚

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/serge_gainsbourg/comic_strip.html">Comic Strip</a>" is a song by Serge Gainsbourg. You know, that's the guy with "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHiMDB19Dyc">Je T'Aime... Moi Non Plus</a>". A few years ago I bought a box with three of his albums, and of course the album "Comic Strip" is not currently available, but at least the song is. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8dkbf3nvLY">YouTube</a>.
