Didn't I tell you there's a pawnbroker in JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe, just for all those photographers in need? Well, yesterday I looked there again, and as always I found something. Lush and oriental. It's not Easter yet, but the eggs are on the table ðŸ™‚

While I yesterday wondered if I should link to CDs or to digital downloads, today it is terrifyingly simple: I must take what I can get. In 1999 XTC, one of the best English bands of all times, returned with the album "Apple Venus Volume 1", to be followed a year later by "Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2)", two extraordinarily good albums. When you look at Amazon today, you can get both via the marketplace, but both albums have been discontinued by the manufacturer, none can be had as digital downloads.

Believe me, I'm not at all communist, I am not against private property, I am not even completely against intellectual property, but what we desperately need, what the world, what our culture needs, what society, what our species needs to further advance, is a return to the premises: Intellectual property is not property at all. You can't own songs once they've been sung. 

 You can have a right to get paid for the publication or even the performance of these songs, that's all well, but we need a system where you waive your rights by refusing to publish. I remember all those years when it was not possible to buy David Lynch's "Twin Peaks". Someone kept it in his safe and waited for a time when he would make the most money by publishing it. That's simply not acceptable. We can't tolerate paintings by Van Gogh and movies by David Lynch to be locked away in safes.

Not publishing music was excusable in the age of vinyl, in the age of plastic, but now, with digital downloads, there is no excuse. Publish or give it up. You stifle our culture.

"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/x/xtc/easter_theatre.html">Easter Theatre</a>" is the song, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mv2Xq-8R_s">YouTube</a> has it.
