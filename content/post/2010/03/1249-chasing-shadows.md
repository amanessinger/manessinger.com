Well, "chasing" is probably too strong, let's say I found them. These are two very different images, and the first one does not even really belong here, but, you know, in the service of bringing you fresh pictures, I'm always twisting my rules ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100314_161306_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100314_161306_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Number one is another image from Sunday afternoon. I had just driven over a bridge, stopped the car and went back. Somehow I liked the water, but then, it was absolutely impossible to keep my shadow out of the image. On the other hand, I liked the shadow as well, thus I took the image. The colors are largely imagined, recreated from memory, or what ever you're willing to believe. Fact is, that white balance was a complete mess and color variation almost non-existent.

 The second image is from Monday morning in Vienna. This is a case where I would have needed a 70 or an 85, thus I didn't take much care framing the image, as I knew, I would have to crop anyway. The image had to go B&amp;W because of some aggressively colored reflections. The toning is a combo of two vanilla Photoshop photo filters, 60% "Deep Yellow" in the highlights, 100% "Deep Blue" in the shadows.
