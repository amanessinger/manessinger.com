Sometimes the whole picture is more than just one image ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/baby_let_me_follow_you_down.html">Baby, Let Me Follow You Down</a>" by Bob Dylan,
  originally from his self-titled debut album. The lyrics are actually from that version, and here is it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU_G4chPn7I&feature=related">YouTube</a>. Compare this to the version from "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwJP46BAuWY">The Last Waltz</a>". Some worlds between them, huh?
