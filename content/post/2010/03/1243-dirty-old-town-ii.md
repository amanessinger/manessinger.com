I regularly infuriate <a target="_blank" href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted Byrne</a> when I post images like this, and in a way I can understand it, imagining him scrubbing graffiti from his house's walls. Yup, it's destruction of private property, and especially, but that won't make a difference to Ted, when it's not even remotely artistic.

Yet I can't imagine a city without these marks. No, I can't even wish for it. It wouldn't feel natural. You can threaten, you can punish, doesn't matter. It still happens. You can't prevent it - and that's good. Look at that image, look at the layers. This is the closest our cities get to being natural, fractal, organic, aging, decaying. It's not always nice, but neither is a carcass in the wilderness.

I'm still at home, still sick, still posting past images. This is from March, 1<sup>st</sup> and though I hope to be out again sometime this week, we could go on like that for a few hundred days. It's interesting plundering the archives.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/david_byrne/dirty_old_town.html">Dirty Old Town</a>". We had a song of that title in "<a target="_blank" href="/2008/10/739-dirty-old-town.html">739 â€“ Dirty Old Town</a>", but that were The Pogues. This time it's David Byrne with a completely different Song from his landmark latin/crossover album "Rei Momo". See a rare live performance, David Byrne some 20 years ago, on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01yRN89Fcc">YouTube</a>. A real gem.
