OK, that's what I talked about in the last entry, the view from my study this morning. This was another day spent at home, relaxing, playing games, finishing Orson Scott Card's sci-fi novel "Ender's Game", winner of both Hugo and Nebula awards, 

 The book didn't impress me all that much. When it came out in 1985, it was criticized for the way it excused violence, but in the end it is not much more than a mix of Potter in space and Full Metal Jacket. In a way.

 It's not a bad book. It's only not great. Still, I liked it well enough that I give the author another chance: I'll continue with the sequel, "Speaker for the Dead". Maybe the whole is more than the first part ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/fleet_foxes/white_winter_hymnal.html">White Winter Hymnal</a>" from the 2008 self titled Fleet Foxes debut album. Great song, see the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrQRS40OKNE">YouTube</a>.
