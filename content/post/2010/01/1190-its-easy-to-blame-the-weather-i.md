It's easy to blame the weather. It had been cruelly dull, but to be honest, the reason why you haven't seen anything since Thursday is much more trivial: I was completely uninspired and uninterested in this world. I spent all my time in Morrowind ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrowind">Morrowind</a>, for all of you who don't play computer games, Morrowind is a computer role playing game, and in fact it is one of the best RPGs of all times. I've played it seven years ago when it was new, I've started over some weeks ago, and at the moment I am again in a phase where I've technically beaten the game.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100117_151744_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100117_151744_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's always the same in Morrowind and in its successor, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion">Oblivion</a>: I can't resist the temptation to use Alchemy. You know, walking around, collecting flowers and brewing potions. It's really the most powerful skill in these games. Once you are advanced in Alchemy, you can boost your stats to insane levels, making it possible to create powerfully enchanted armor and weapons. I really had intended to resist the temptation, to just play a humble wizard, but then I got drawn in again. Well, I've become pretty good over the weekend. Not yet god-like, but I'm getting along ðŸ™‚

It's Sunday night now, I'm on the train to Vienna, and I intend to cheat, at least according to my rules. You'll get three posts with a total of four images, one for Friday, one for Saturday and one for today, but all images were taken today. On Friday I was too much in a hurry, I didn't manage to make a usable image, and on Saturday I took no single image at all. Morrowind.

 Today was sunny and I forced myself to go out, drive up mount Dobratsch, and indeed I came back with enough usable material to bridge the gap. Hope you don't mind.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/its_easy_to_blame_the_weather.html">It's Easy To Blame The Weather</a>" by Billie Holiday. I have it on a 10 CD collection that isn't available via Amazon, thus I link to "The Quintessential Billie Holiday, Vol.7: 1938-1939".
