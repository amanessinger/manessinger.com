OK, I stop bitching about the weather. Let's use it.

 Here is another one of these low down shots, again with the camera set to the ground, this time in B&amp;W. It's not what I intended to use as the Image of the Day, but when I began working on it - just for fun - I soon began to really like it ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/travelling_wilburys/dirty_world.html">Dirty World</a>" from the 1988 Traveling Wilburys album "Volume 1". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-zjFp70esY">YouTube</a>. Just ignore the annotation overlay on the video. It's not much of a video anyway ðŸ˜„
