New Year's Day. We were out to lunch with my parents, and on the way back to Villach, I decided to take smaller roads.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100101_150250.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100101_150250.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> We had a thick cloud cover, and around a height of 500-600 meters there was a layer of fog. That's what I was heading for.

You know my obsession with ways leading into the image, well, here are three variations on the theme, all rather typical of today.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100101_150602.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100101_150602.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> Fog is a little bit challenging, photography-wise. Automatic white balance is frequently off. Take the image of the Day: I had to shift it way into the greens. Now I guess it's pretty what I saw. 

I've also made it darker. Fog images have low dynamics, thus the dynamic range of our digital cameras is more than enough. The D300 had placed the histogram more to the right. Of course I could have corrected it in-camera, but then, I prefer to rather expose to the right and later tone it down, than otherwise. Keeps the noise down.

 The other two images are just JPEGs from the camera. 

The Song of the Day is "A Foggy Day" in the rendition from Charles Mingus' 1956 album "Pithecanthropus Erectus". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://video.nate.com/208242821">Nate</a>. Seems to be a South Korean site, though I admit I don't understand anything.
