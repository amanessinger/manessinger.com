Well, I don't seem to have caught up ðŸ˜„

It's Friday morning now, I am in a hurry, and this is only the image of Tuesday. Maybe in the afternoon when I am on the train to Carinthia.

 "<a target="_blank" href="/2007/12/440-round-bend.html">440 â€“ Round The Bend</a>" was one of my better images in the past, made with another fabulous lens, the then new Sigma 70/2.8. This time, while on the tramway, I greatly profited from the Tamron's stabilization. There's not much in focus in today's image, but the little that is, is perfectly so.

The Song of the Day is again "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beck/round_the_bend.html">Round The Bend</a>" from Beck's 2002 album "Sea Change". See the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmeag1rwQgo">YouTube</a>.
