Carinthia is covered in fog. Yesterday a look at the webcams made it clear: Italy was the place to go.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100123_153301_ps_color.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100123_153301_ps_color.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> We started out late, and although we certainly enjoyed the sun, I didn't make many usable images. I have some more, but definitely not of the "Sunny Italy" kind.

This particular image was taken under a highway bridge. The challenge was to both contain the tonal range and, on the other hand, to convey the sense of being blinded by the light. I finally ended up using black and white, with a combination of Photoshop's "High Contrast Blue" filter for most of the scene, and "High Contrast Red" for some highlight regions, and I really like the result. It combines both the texture in the concrete (via the blue filter) and the dramatic contrast (via the red). 

 The color version is definitely more cheerful though, and because it better reflects yesterday's mood, this time I leave you the choice.
