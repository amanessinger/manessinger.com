One of the nice things in winter, don't laugh, it's that the days are so short. Even a lazy sloth as I can see a sunrise.

It's late, I won't make a second post with today's, I'll try to catch up tomorrow.

This weekend we made the second attempt at <a target="_blank" href="/2007/12/425-michael-and-happy-fish.html">Michael</a>'s migration from Salzburg to Vienna, and this time we succeeded. Weather was with us. You may remember, the first attempt two weeks ago was thwarted by heavy snowfall.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100103_084344_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100103_084344_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Again I fetched the car, a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Ducato">Fiat Ducato Mark 3</a>, on Saturday, left it over night in Villach, and at 7am I was already on the highway north, towards Salzburg. I had to cross the mountains, that's where I made two short stops, not necessarily in the best places, just where it was possible, took some images in bitter cold, and then drove on.

I really wish I could have stopped wherever I wanted. I saw some absolutely breathtaking vistas, the snowy castle of Werfen in front of the most majestic snow-capped mountains, some winter dreams of magnificent beauty, but alas most of the time I was speeding along at 130 kmph with no chance to stop.

 You have to take my word and the few images I was able to capture. I wildly enjoyed driving across the mountain range of the Alps, seeing all that beauty and even being able to snap a few pictures.

The actual migration took us till the evening, and there's still a lot to do in Michael's new apartment. Tomorrow night we'll re-assemble his furniture, but most of the grunt work is done. Now, when I think of it, maybe I won't be able to catch up tomorrow ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is the hauntingly beautiful "Alone With The Moon" from the 1998 Tiger Lillies album "The Brothel to the Cemetery". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDuvhGQCqWw">YouTube</a>.
