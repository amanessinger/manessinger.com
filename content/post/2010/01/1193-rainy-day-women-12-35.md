OK, after Sunday's sunny splendor, Vienna felt like a shock. I arrived late Sunday night in light snowfall, and in the morning most of it had been washed away by rain. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100118_084543_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100118_084543_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Mind you, the emphasis is on "most". Even today, Tuesday morning, when I look out of the window, the snow is not completely gone. The slush will stay with us. How do you like that, Mr Cedric Canard? ðŸ˜„

We had those mannequins a few times, notably in "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/01/829-dedicated-follower-of-fashion.html">829 â€“ Dedicated Follower Of Fashion</a>", "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/05/948-hit-road-to-dreamland.html">948 â€“ Hit The Road To Dreamland</a>" (as one of the additional images) and "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/07/1006-great-song-of-indifference.html">1006 â€“ The Great Song Of Indifference</a>". Here I had just to wait a little, until the approaching cars provided the right light.

 The Song of the Day, well, this was an obvious one. We already had the song <a target="_blank" href="/2008/12/797-rainy-day-woman.html">some time ago</a>, though not the exact title. "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/rainy_day_women_12_35.html">Rainy Day Women #12 & 35</a>" from one of Bob Dylan's early masterpieces, the 1966 double album "Blonde on Blonde".
