I can't believe it, I really managed to catch up. Now guess where I took this image ðŸ™‚

The image has been taken with a bit of flash again. You really have to be careful, too much flash makes the snow flakes the brightest part of the image, and that looks very unnatural. In this case I'm quite satisfied with the balance.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aaron_neville/im_waitin_at_the_station.html">I'm Waitin' At The Station</a>", an early hit by Aaron Neville. I have it on a collection that's not available any more, but you can get it on the 2001 "Ultimate Collection". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNcXYkZHlZk">YouTube</a>.
