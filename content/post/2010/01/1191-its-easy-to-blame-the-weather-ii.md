Here we are, one more image of today's bunch, this one is for Saturday, although, as I've explained in the last post, it was taken today.

 

The Song of the Day is still "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/its_easy_to_blame_the_weather.html">It's Easy To Blame The Weather</a>" by Billie Holiday. I have it on a 10 CD collection that isn't available via Amazon, thus I link to "The Quintessential Billie Holiday, Vol.7: 1938-1939". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix_jMC_NH9E">YouTube</a>.
