Oh yes, I'm really, really tired. No catching up for today. On the other hand, I had already thought I wouldn't have an image for yesterday, and now that I see this bike, I think it has turned out pretty well.

 I was more or less forced to go B&amp;W, because this image was taken under the worst of lights, you know, these impossible sodium vapor lights that look orange even at a color temperature of 2000 K.

The Song of the Day? Well, I don't know, something in the pose of this bike made me think that "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eels/prizefighter.html">Prizefighter</a>" from the 2009 Eels album "Hombre Lobo: 12 Songs of Desire" would not be entirely wrong.
