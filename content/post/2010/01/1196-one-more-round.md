One more round, one more image posted this Friday afternoon, and one more round of snowfall we had on Thursday.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100121_085549_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100121_085549_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Actually I don't mind. It's colder now, not really uncomfortably cold (well, depends on who you ask), and that may give the snow a chance to last a few days. Of course this habit of using road salt guarantees slush even when it's substantially below freezing, but at least they only do it on the sidewalks.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bette_midler/one_more_round.html">One More Round</a>" from Bette Midler's 1990 album "Some People's Lives". Hear it in a video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x23814_chicks-rule-bsg-female-cast_shortfilms">Dailymotion</a>. Typical for its time, music that maybe didn't age all that well, but I like it anyway. Ever have ðŸ™‚
