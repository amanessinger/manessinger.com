Really, it does. It's more or less the same image as in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/01/1182-where-do-the-children-play-ii.html">1182 â€“ Where Do The Children Play II</a>". The point of view is not exactly the same, for once because I couldn't remember exactly, but more important, I had to avoid some bright lights that would have been at the edge of the frame. It's a different game when the lights come up.

 Other than that, I was there 48 minutes later than last time, and it makes quite a difference.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/morrissey/such_a_little_thing_makes_such_a_big_difference.html">Such A Little Thing Makes Such A Big Difference</a>" from Morrissey's 1990 album "Bona Drag".
