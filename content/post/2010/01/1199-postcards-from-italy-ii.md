Sundays, you know? This lazy feeling, and then on a day like this. According to the web cam on mount Dobratsch, even above the dense fog cover, it was cloudy and the light was flat. No reason to drive up the mountain, instead I have squeezed one more image out of yesterday's collection.

The result is maybe not too bad, I have even made it another wallpaper in my small collection of downloadable wallpapers. The problem is, most of my images are composed for exactly the format that they are published in. In this case, with the trees that are cut off anyway, it was possible to produce wallpapers in the most common sizes, without really changing the character of the image.

 It's interesting: the wallpapers are the most popular content on this blog. Of course I have expected them to be popular, but the extent took me by surprise ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is one more time "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beirut/postcards_from_italy.html">Postcards From Italy</a>" from the fantastic 2006 Beirut album "Gulag Orkestar". See the video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjzVbXeD_8E">YouTube</a>. It's a somehow melancholic song and I like it greatly.
