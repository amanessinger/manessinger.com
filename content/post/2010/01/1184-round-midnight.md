Weather forecasts are funny. We got maybe a third of the predicted amount of snow, and thankfully so far nothing of the predicted rain. Today there's even the potential for a partly sunny day, at least I can see some blue sky from my window.

Anyway. This is an image from last night, we were at a corporate Christmas party that had been delayed to actually after Christmas, and when we returned to Villach, it was around midnight. I had not made a single image on whole Saturday, and when we came up from the underground garage, I decided to try a few shots in the corridor. The corridors in our building are open to the outside, only protected by a glass facade, and that fact has already <a target="_blank" href="/2009/01/828-through-glass-darkly.html">served</a> <a target="_blank" href="/2009/01/821-freezing-iii.html">me</a> <a target="_blank" href="/2009/01/820-freezing-ii.html">well</a> last winter.

Technically this image was taken 33 seconds past midnight, but I still count it for yesterday. It's a JPEG, straight out of the camera.

 The Song of the Day is "'Round Midnight" by Thelonious Monk. I have it on the 1989 soundtrack album "Straight No Chaser: Music From The Motion Picture". See a video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX_mwDvcZ2I">YouTube</a>, and while you're there, why not see another live version, this time sung by noone less than the great <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHV1g3LYVSE">Ella Fitzgerald</a>?
