Today I was tired. I had had some technical problems and had hunted for explanations all day, and although I had nothing original, I had little hope for inspiration on my way home. One should never give up though. In a way it is routine. Do it as long as I do, and you do it almost automatically. It does not need much consciousness.

 I fooled around, switched ISO automatic off, held the camera firmly to a wall or a shop window, this way exposed for about a second, looked what I got, adjusted, repeated. I must have stood there for minutes, concentrated, experimenting, and suddenly all the day's troubles were past. I was whole again.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/willie_nelson/night_life.html">Night Life</a>" from the 2008 album "Two Men With The Blues" by Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis. Fine album, we had it a few times, but not this song so far. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRxLeUNwv4w">YouTube</a>.
