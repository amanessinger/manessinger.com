And here's the last of the three catch-up posts of today. Again the image was taken on mount Dobratsch, the mountain that broke apart in 1348's catastrophic earth quake.

 The Song of the Day is one last time "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/billie_holiday/its_easy_to_blame_the_weather.html">It's Easy To Blame The Weather</a>" by Billie Holiday. I have it on a 10 CD collection that isn't available via Amazon, thus I link to "The Quintessential Billie Holiday, Vol.7: 1938-1939". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix_jMC_NH9E">YouTube</a>.
