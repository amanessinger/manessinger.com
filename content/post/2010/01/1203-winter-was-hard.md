Thursday. We had snow, for a change. This image was taken in JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe, I was in a rush and seemingly everything else as well ðŸ™‚

I expect to put up one more post today, in the afternoon, when I'm on the train.

 It's interesting, by the way. This is post #84 made with the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC. Quite some proof that this lens works for me ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Winter Was Hard", an Aulis Sallinen composition from the Kronos Quartet's 1990 album of the same name. Take it as an acoustic counterpoint to the sense of speed in the image and hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ToycgrhdQs">YouTube</a>.
