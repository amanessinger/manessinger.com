This and the image of the next post (that I'll write in a few minutes) were both taken today, Sunday, on a short walk down along the river. I have made a few images on Saturday, but that was such an exceptionally dreary day, with fog, high clouds and then in the afternoon snowfall, that I really beg you to excuse me: I can't possibly find a single usable image from Saturday.

I could have driven up the mountain for some spectacular images, but sometimes it is just fine to take a short walk in the neighborhood and look out for the more silent beauties. I like this way along river Gail, just before it joins river Drau. The fallen trees give you all sorts of interesting angles. I could probably have fiddled with local contrast in the foreground snow, but instead I chose to simply upload the JPEG from the camera. I guess there's nothing really wrong with it.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/don_mclean/winterwood.html">Winterwood</a>" from Don McLean's 1972 release "American Pie". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RqJNpe6otk">YouTube</a>. Sort of fits my mood today ðŸ™‚
