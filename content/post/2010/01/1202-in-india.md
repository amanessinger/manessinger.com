Sorry, it took me ages again, but here it is, the image for Wednesday. I found this on the outside wall of a not-so-posh Indian restaurant in Vienna.

 As to the Song of the Day, I can offer you "In India" from Carla Bley's 1974 second collaboration with Paul Haines, "Tropic Appetites". Seemingly I am fortunate to own the CD, because at the Amazon marketplace it is sold at $183 new and from $126 used. Amazon has it as MP3 downloads as well though, for just the usual price. Economy never stops to amaze me ðŸ˜„
