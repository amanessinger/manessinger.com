Here's one more post for today. It's Friday afternoon, I'm on the train to Carinthia and this image was taken in the morning. This was more or less an experiment. I focused near and then just held the camera over a snow-covered flower bed.

 When I later looked at the image, I really liked the delicate lace. Making it black and white and cropping to a square even increased the effect.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/tenderly.html">Tenderly</a>", this time not sung by Billie Holiday, this time it's Anita O'Day on her 1957 album "Anita Sings the Most". Online I've found this version only in a somewhat mutilated video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05Co4QVG2t0&feature=related">YouTube</a>. It's a "duet" where some guy has mixed his own voice into the song. Fortunately he leaves her alone until 1:30. Just switch off at that point and no harm will be done to your inner peace ðŸ˜„
