That's the last update for today, two images that were actually taken this morning.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100122_080207_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100122_080207_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's some details, the backlight of a car and some waste, standing in front of a house entrance, waiting to be taken away. It's the same kind of boxes that we had a long, long time ago in "<a target="_blank" href="/2006/11/47-time-of-waste.html">47 â€“ Time of Waste</a>". Please see there for the story of why we use those funny boxes ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/amy_winehouse/take_the_box.html">Take The Box</a>" from Amy Winehouse's 2007 album "Frank". That girl may have a drug problem, but, oh boy, she sure can sing! Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egpsoqLxkQE">YouTube</a>.
