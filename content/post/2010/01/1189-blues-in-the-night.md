That's more of the same and I like that. More of the same is fine for me if it's more of what I like. 

Both images were taken at ISO 200, both with ISO automatics turned off, both with the camera firmly held against a wall, both without looking through the viewfinder, both at long exposure times, the Image of the Day even at three seconds.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100114_172003_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100114_172003_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Now that I think of it, I didn't heed my own advice. Basically these were tripod situations, just without the tripod, and I didn't turn image stabilization off.

Interesting. I have made many similar images in the last few days, and I didn't get anything like the anomalies that I showed in "<a target="_blank" href="/2010/01/1177-shake-away.html">1177 â€“ Shake Away</a>". The same is true for "<a target="_blank" href="/2009/12/1170-by-the-rivers-dark.html">1170 â€“ By The Rivers Dark</a>", and that WAS taken from a tripod. You see me confused ðŸ™‚

Still, if I ever manage to remember, I'll most likely turn stabilization off in such situations. Or maybe not, because now I'm interested ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day, "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/ella_fitzgerald/blues_in_the_night.html">Blues In The Night</a>", is probably my favorite on one of my most favorite albums of all times, Ella Fitzgerald's 1959 release "Ella Swings Lightly". Very recommendable, but check for yourself on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-aWKCNkhC4">YouTube</a>.
