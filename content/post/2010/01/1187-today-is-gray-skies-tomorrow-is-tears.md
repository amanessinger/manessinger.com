Why I took the image? Hmm ... in a way I like the lace of the tree in the background. Other than that, it's the usual old game: take some simple forms and arrange them in the frame. Here I think the angle and the asymmetry work together and build up the tension that makes the image. At least for me that is ðŸ˜„

 If you've got some time to burn, why not read <a target="_blank" href="http://kenrockwell.com/tech/basics.htm">an article</a> by Ken Rockwell? The interesting part is that bit about punchlines and double punchlines. Not new, but always good to remember.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tom_waits/yesterday_is_here.html">Yesterday Is Here</a>" from Tom Waits' 1987 landmark album "Frank's Wild Years". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dnv5L59eSo">YouTube</a>, and while you're there, you should probably hear Cat Power's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFoDaZalPyU&feature=related">cover version</a> as well ðŸ™‚
