OK, here's the second post of today's series. After the plain modesty of the last post, here's some pompous HDR for a change.

In fact, this image is not without some serious imperfections. I had made the seven bracketed images in high-speed continuous mode, meaning in only a fraction more than a second, but if you look at 100% (which I won't let you), you see that Photomatix Pro can't eliminate the subtle displacements of the twigs' reflections in the water. The program has a box that you can check, and it's supposed to be able to cope with water, but in fact it can't. It's easy to understand why, because the problem is insolvable in general. There may be cases where it works, but in general it does not.

Anyway, I'd say for web presentation it's good enough, in fact it is good enough when viewed on screen at 50%, so I prefer to ignore the fact. Still, it's important to know that you still can't really depend on such algorithms. They invariably let you down at times.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/natalie_merchant/river.html">River</a>" from Natalie Merchant's 1995 album "Tigerlily". Funny, I always thought that gal sounded like the singer of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10,000_Maniacs">10000 Maniacs</a> ðŸ˜„
