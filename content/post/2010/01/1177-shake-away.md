For a change, this is another part of my review of the new Tamron SP AF 17-50mm 2.8 XR Di II VC LD Asp IF.

 Basically it's no big news, it's just a warning. You know, every now and then someone asks at the photography forums if it is necessary to turn lens stabilization off when working from the tripod. I mostly see this asked on Photo.net's Nikon forum, but that's just what I read. I am sure it is the sama at Canon forums.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20100102_161243.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20100102_161243.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a> Normally there are no clear answers: some people say it makes no difference, some claim to see it, some tell us that it depends on the lens, and so on a so forth. Well, nobody has asked me about this lens, but as I stumbled upon it today, here's the answer: If working from the tripod with Tamron's stabilized 17-50/2.8, for heaven's sake turn stabilization off, at least when you work on the long end.

 The second image is a JPEG straight from the camera. See the shake? It's extreme. Because of the gloomy light at 4:10pm I used a tripod. I was in a hurry and because of the snow I didn't review the images when I was there. I simply assumed that they would be good enough. Why not, when  shooting ISO 200 from a tripod? Well, here it is, the image could not have been worse hand held.

The Song of the Day is "Shake Away" from Lila Downs' equally titled 2008 album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6llVKuf8LLA">YouTube</a>. Great song, great album ðŸ™‚
