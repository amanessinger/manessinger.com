I'm on the train to Carinthia and this is the image for Wednesday. January 6 is a public holiday in Austria and I used the day for a trip to Stadlau, a part of Vienna where our company is supposed to move in about three years. This is the local cemetery, photographed though the gates.

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/cemetry_gates.html">Cemetery Gates</a>" from the 1986 Smiths album "The Queen Is Dead". Great music, hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knM7ow5vMPA&feature=related">YouTube</a>.
