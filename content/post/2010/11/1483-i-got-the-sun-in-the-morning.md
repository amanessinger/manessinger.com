Sun in the morning, yes, that's what I've got. I went to sleep very early yesterday, and when I woke up at 3am, I processed yesterday's image, posted yesterday's post, read a little (well, more than a little), and suddenly it seemed stupid to go to bed again. 

 It was a wonderful, warm morning, actually it felt almost like Spring, and though I left home early, I arrived at work almost as late as usual. It was all looking, photographing, enjoying the sun, and here's one of the images.

The Song of the Day is Irving Berlin's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/i/irving_berlin/i_got_the_sun_in_the_morning.html">I Got The Sun In The Morning</a>", performed by June Christy. I couldn't find it on YouTube and therefore have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVNLn5ZGGic">uploaded it myself</a>.
