Here's an image that I took on the street today. 5:08 pm. Taken with the Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC. At f2.8. 1/6s. ISO 3200.

 It could be worse though. Today at 12:50 pm I saw a Norwegian webcam image from some place on the isle of Spitzbergen. 78 degrees north. It was pitch black night. Just to put things in  perspective ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "One Bell Ringing" from Elvis Costello's 2010 album "National Ransom". See a live video on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqRMWEaSYXw">YouTube</a>.
