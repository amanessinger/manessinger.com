Today it's raining again. I had some business in Carinthia, thus I am only now, in mid-afternoon, on the train back to Vienna.

 Neither did I have the time to take photographs, nor was it overly inviting, thus you get an image that's already a week old. It has been processed and uploaded all the while, and I pretty like it, because although it is not at all faithful to what the camera recorded, I think the processing is unobtrusive and the result looks believable. But then, I should think so, and if you disagree, please tell me why ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/winter.html">Winter</a>" from the 1973 Rolling Stones album "Goats Head Soup". Here's it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frt_f0eP_Hs">YouTube</a>.
