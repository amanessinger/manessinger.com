Today was another day where I rose very early, answered some comments (well, I know I am much too lazy at that, or rather, I am not lazy but much too short of time), and then I went to work, and even though I made it there earlier than usual, I was able to take enough time for photographing.

I used the manual focus 85/1.4 AI-S for a change, and although it is pretty challenging, it is also pretty satisfying when you get a shot. This was another image, that called for a frame.

 The frame in this image is from onOne Software's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ononesoftware.com/free/">PhotoFrame 4.5 Free Edition</a>" plugin. Hey, I really like this approach, and I suppose that I will actually buy the commercial version. Why is this better than a time-limited trial version, you ask? Simple. It gives me more time to try it and see if I find it useful. I don't use frames all the time, and the opportunity to test the plugin may not be there at all times. With this free version I can test as long as I want.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/best_is_yet_to_come.html">The Best Is Yet To Come</a>" from the Frank Sinatra collection "Duets 2". The duet is with Jon Secada, by the way, and you can hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsY4clRtKVc">YouTube</a>.
