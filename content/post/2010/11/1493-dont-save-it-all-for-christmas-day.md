Yes, it's that time of the year again. Christmas is beginning to fill the treasure troves. Here's an image from yesterday evening.

 By the way, should you have liked my waterfall image from Sunday (and more so if not), I'd like to point you to the fact that I have uploaded <a target="_blank" href="/2010/11/1492-waterfall-ii.html">a new version</a>. I normally don't do that, but I was really not glad at all with the old version. <a target="_blank" href="/2010/11/1492-waterfall-ii.html">See for yourself</a>.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/celine_dion/dont_save_it_all_for_christmas_day.html">Don't Save It All For Christmas Day</a>" from Celine Dion's 1998 album "These Are Special Times". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t2jOlyxrVQ">YouTube</a>.
