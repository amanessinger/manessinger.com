It's still Friday, I'm still on the train and here's yesterday's image, a bicycle for a change. But then, I didn't have many of them lately 🙂

 The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/guns_n_roses/pretty_tied_up.html">Pretty Tied Up</a>", again from the 1991 Guns N’ Roses album “Use Your Illusion II”. Again you can hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFbujpjmTzs">YouTube</a>.
