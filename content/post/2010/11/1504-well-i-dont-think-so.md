Three bicycle images on one day? Well, I don't think so. Not that I don't have one, I even would have had two, and one of them is not even bad, but I guess that's one for the TODO list ðŸ™‚

 Today when I went to work, I passed an open door, and looking through it, I saw this scene. I liked the pattern of the tubes on the floor, and although this is ISO 3200 at 1/15s, it came out pretty well. OK, I've used Topaz DeNoise and a bag of tricks, but still, not bad for a D300 ðŸ™‚

Two posts ago I said I've bought the new Ron Wood album, and here it is. Amazing. Someone, I believe on Amazon, called it the album that the Stones should have made for years, and yes, this album is fabulous.

Oh, by the way, I also said that tomorrow's post may be more interesting, and the reason is, that I am on the train to Carinthia, and in Carinthia it's snowing like mad. So, if I'm lucky and I get a bit of sunshine tomorrow, I may take a walk though the snow. Let's see ðŸ˜„
