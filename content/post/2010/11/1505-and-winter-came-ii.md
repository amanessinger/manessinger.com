It's late Sunday morning now. Outside it is a cold, cloudy winter day. It's the kind of day that is probably the worst case for photography: white, flat light illuminates white things in front of a white background.

But then, this is not about today, it's about yesterday, and yesterday was just as I had hoped. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101127_115859_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101127_115859_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It was a sunny day and I decided to take a walk in my moon boots. I started only about a kilometer from home, near the river Gail, in a nature reserve south of Villach.

 I could have easily had much more snow, but on a sunny day I enjoy the combination of river and snow.

The Song of the Day is the same as in "<a target="_blank" href="/2008/11/771-and-winter-came.html">771 - And Winter Came</a>". It is the title song of Enya's 2008 album. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP1wXee6ZdU">YouTube</a>.

Oh, by the way, I did some work-related research while writing this post, processed some more of yesterday's images, and now it's mid-afternoon. It snows like hell outside. You think it doesn't snow in hell? Well, in mine it does ðŸ™‚

Anyway. This means you will get another post today with some more images of yesterday. Hope you don't mind.
