Today I wanted to go for an extended walk, but although the rain had mostly stopped, it was always on the verge of raining again. Thus I took the car, drove around for an hour or two, took some images here, some images there, and the image that I finally selected, was this rhapsody in orange.

 Meanwhile we are back from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time. It's 5:20 pm and outside it is already dark. Winter is near.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/guns_n_roses/november_rain.html">November Rain</a>" from the 1991 Guns N' Roses album "Use Your Illusion I".
