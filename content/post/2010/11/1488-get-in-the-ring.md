It's Friday, I am on the train to Carinthia and here is one image from and for Wednesday.

 I have no idea what these masks are doing in the window of a shop and what this shop actually sells. Looks as if the masks were wrestling-related? Anyway, I liked the the composition with the birds on the wall. Don't ask 😄

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/guns_n_roses/get_in_the_ring.html">Get In The Ring</a>" from the 1991 Guns N’ Roses album “Use Your Illusion II”. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUnVp-CWbU">YouTube</a>.
