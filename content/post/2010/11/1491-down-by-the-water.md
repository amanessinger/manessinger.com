Once again I have a nice computer problem. Our main computer here in Villach, the one connected to a 1920x1200 monitor, crashes. It does so randomly but progressively. In such a case my first idea is always to check memory, but I've done so weeks ago and twice since, and at least my memory check utility can't find a thing.

With some confidence (because of the pattern of crashes) I had suspected the graphics card, but although replacing the card had looked like a good idea, it brought relief for only a short time. Recently it has started again, and now it is progressing. The computer not only crashes every few days, now it's after only a few minutes. 

This sucks. I really have no idea what to change next, and, most aggravating, when I change the motherboard (which could be the problem, I had something like that years ago), I can as well buy a new computer. I would have to re-install the operating system. No problem with Linux, it would just boot, but normally Windows systems don't like it when you change the base they're running on.

Changing motherboard/CPU, re-installing Windows and all apps? Could be a nightmare next weekend. And then? There is no guarantee that it will solve the problem. I was so sure that the graphics card was the culprit, but then I threw away the money for the new card. What if it happens again??

Oh, and: don't even think that the Windows event log contains the slightest trace of useful information. 

Ok, ok, I stop. I guess I'll buy a new computer next weekend, walk through hell and such, and in the end everything will be fine for another year.

The Image of the Day is from a walk down to the river this afternoon. It's one of these images where you just have to take a series, because the result is so hard to predict, but then, if you persevere, you'll eventually get what you're looking for. In my case it was the upper right corner ðŸ™‚

 The colors in this image are "made", much in the spirit of Alain Briot's fourth part of "Composing with Color", up on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/columns/composing_with_color_part_4.shtml">Luminous Landscape</a>. If you haven't read it yet, I really urge you to do so. It's very good stuff, and especially the example of "Zabriskie Point Sunset: local desaturation" is extremely inspiring, at least it was for me. I routinely do similar things, but I so far I normally didn't do just that.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pj_harvey/down_by_the_water.html">Down By The Water</a>" from P. J. Harvey's 1995 album "To Bring You My Love". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru2a4BlTrtw">YouTube</a>.
