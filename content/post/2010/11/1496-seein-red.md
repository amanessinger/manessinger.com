Two days ago someone at work, not a regular reader of this blog, asked me what I photograph every day,implying that there couldn't be anything worthy on a foggy day. "Colors", I thought, "and it's only you who can't see them".

 The Song of the Day is "Seein' Red" by Edmond Hall's All Star Quintet. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNGrn5yk5bU">YouTube</a>.
