We had a beautiful and warm day today, and although it couldn't make me forget my computer troubles, it still made life much easier ðŸ˜„

File this image under "Found Waterfalls", because I didn't look for it, it was just there, around the bend, on a steep forest road.

 The Tamron 17-50/2.8 VC is ideal for that kind of images. It's wide enough to capture the scene, and with stabilization turned on, I can go down to 1/4s, and that already makes the water smooth and silky. Sure, you may need more than one attempt, but hey, a waterfall doesn't run away, does it?

The Song of the Day is one more time "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/james/waterfall.html">Waterfall</a>" from the 2008 James album "Hey Ma". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-zngNd4ee8">YouTube</a>.

This time I do it. The image as you see it now, is a new version. I have made it in Vienna after I saw the original on a big monitor. To the left you see the image as it was originally published. In my opinion the water was too blue, the image too cool and generally lacking contrast. I like it much better now, but decide for yourself.
