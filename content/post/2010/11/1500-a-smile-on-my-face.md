Another 500 full. As time goes by ðŸ™‚

This is the image for yesterday, Monday. I would have had at least another image, a bicycle, but searching for a title, I immediately thought of this line from "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/gene_kelly/singin_in_the_rain_from_singin_in_the_rain.html">Singin' In The Rain</a>", and so I had the illusion I'd save time when I take just that and put the bike on my TODO list.

 Not exactly so. I've spent hours now searching for a version of the song that I both have and that's available on YouTube. Well, I only had The 3 Tenors from their 1994 concert, but as I don't particularly like that version, I decided to buy something.

In the end I found Nora Arnezeder together with FÃ©loche, a song used in a TV ad for Guerlain's perfume <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1xH52bBypY&feature=related">"Idylle"</a>. Here's the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNBlSxLEE9o">original song video</a>. Oh yes, great ðŸ™‚

 Another version, one that's not on YouTube, is by Maria Muldaur, a singer I didn't even know before, and while it's not my favorite version either, researching Muldaur further, I found a "Live in Concert" album with lots of Dylan covers, and ... well, let's say that I have some songs more now. Here's a Hungarian site with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mommo.hu/media/1943_szeptember_12-en_szuletett_Maria_Muldaur">Maria Muldaur's version of "Buckets Of Rain"</a>. It's not from the live album but from her 2006 Dylan album "Heart Of Mine".
