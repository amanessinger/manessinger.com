Before you begin to wonder, yes, this is the last post for today ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2010/20101110_172503_ps.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2010/20101110_172503_ps.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I'm still on the train to Carinthia, and I have to go back to Wednesday, because today I had to hurry in the morning to get to work, and in order to catch the train in the afternoon, I had to take a taxi. I didn't take a single image. Oh dear!

 The fog image was taken Wednesday morning, and the other image, a semi-opaque window with some plants behind, in the evening. For both I've used the Nikon 84/1.4 AI-S.

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/ray_charles/early_in_the_mornin.html">Early In The Mornin'</a>" from Cyndi Lauper's latest album "Memphis Blues". Funny: people seem to either love it or hate it. As regards me, I love it dearly. Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sMEvEAks4I">YouTube</a>. Btw, the guy doing background vocals is B. B. King ðŸ˜„
