Here's some image that I took in the morning.

 I have not made that many bicycle images lately, but bicycles are always on my radar. Basically I have taken so many bike images, that it takes no conscious effort any more. I see them wherever they are.

 The Song of the Day is "Pastime With Good Company" aka "King Henry's Madrigal". Searching for the word "company" in my song collection, I stumbled upon the version on Gary Brooker's album "Within Our House", but of course the classic is by Jethro Tull. Hear it on <a arget="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1SslhwR7qg">YouTube</a>.
