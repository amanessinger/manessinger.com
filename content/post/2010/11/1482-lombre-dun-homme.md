Light is in the mornings now, and on my way to work this time I took a different route through one of the roads with lots of bike traffic. Originally I was trying different framings for the combination of graffiti and one of the few trees that still have most of their leaves. When a biker rushed through, I thought it would probably be cool to capture the next one. So I did.

 You know I'm always eager to bring you fresh music, and among the first albums that I search for an image title, are always those that I bought last. This is not always successful, some albums sit in the queue for a long time until a matching image comes along, but here is one that I bought just last weekend: 

The amazing Ben L'Oncle Soul and "L'Ombre D'Un Homme" (The Shadow Of  A Man) from his self-titled 2010 album. I could buy it as digital download, Amazon in the US only has it as a very expensive CD import. Surely carrying IP packages over the Atlantic ocean would have been overly expensive and out of the question. Oh dear!

Here's it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpEpIHx1gdY">YouTube</a>, and while you're there, don't forget to hear into some of the other titles like "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tm6bDWAOFJk&feature=related">Come Home</a>" or "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nuutH_TRNs&feature=related">Soulman</a>". Good stuff, huh?
