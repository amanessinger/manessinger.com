Here's one more image of yesterday. Why? Because it's raining outside.

 Yesterday was a wonderful, warm day, but yesterday is gone.

This also happens to be the title of the Song of the Day. It's "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lenny_kravitz/yesterday_is_gone.html">Yesterday Is Gone</a>" from Lenny Kravitz' 2001 album "Lenny". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw86aZCg86o">YouTube</a>.
