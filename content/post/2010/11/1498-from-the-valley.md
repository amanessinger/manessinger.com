Carinthia is enclosed by mountain ranges, and from mid-fall to mid-spring it is plagued by temperature inversion. There is not much pollution, but fog is a frequent condition.

 In such cases, the best idea is to leave the valleys and get up on a mountain, for instance <a target="_blank" href="/tag/dobratsch">Dobratsch</a>, the most obvious choice here in Villach. And even if it doesn't get you sunshine, such as on Saturday, the view down into the foggy valley is always breathtaking.

The Song of the Day is "From The Valley" from Joe Bonamassa's 2009 album "The Ballad Of John Henry". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp1ILrwVgg8">YouTube</a>. Beautiful guitar play indeed ðŸ™‚
