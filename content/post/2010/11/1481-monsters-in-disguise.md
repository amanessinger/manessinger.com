It's an ad. It's one of those backlit ads that we now see everywhere, and when I approached, this mouth that I saw through the twigs of a shrub, it somehow made an aggressive, a predatory impression.

 I took two images, one focused on the foreground twigs, one focused on the ad, and that's the one that finally made it.
