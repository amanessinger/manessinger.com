Did I mention my optimism has gone down the drain? My deep conviction that things in history get better in the long run?
That we have agency?

The criminal in the White House has been on his second run for a year now, and at that
speed and extent of lunatic behaviour, he might wreck the world before we get a chance at the mid-terms. 

It is exhausting. I've tried not reading the news, reading books instead, but at the moment I am back to breathlessly
doomscrolling. I've got to stop that.
