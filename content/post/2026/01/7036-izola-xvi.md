Harsh sunlight from high above. How I miss it in winter. I'm writing this on a bleak foggy day in Vienna. We've just
returned from a week in a thermal spa in Styria. The weather was ok there. Not always sunny, but you had a little bit of
sun every day. While we were there, Vienna had constant high fog. It might go away next week though.
