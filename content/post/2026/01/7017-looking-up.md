Not even a year of Trump, and things get weirder and
weirder. Yeah, sure, Maduro probably deserves to be brought
to justice, but why on earth in New York?

Venezuelan oil belongs to the US? Just like Greenland? Or
Ukraine to Putin?

It's official now: In less than a year the not so United
States of Middle-North-America have become a rogue state.
That's the kind of state that they themselves like to bomb 
as punishment for doing what Trump does with impunity.

Not anymore. Trump loves rogue states and he hates
democracies. Can anyone please explain to him in simple
words, like to a child, that the word Democracy is not an
invention of the Democratic Party?

And can I please wake up tomorrow and find out it was just a
nightmare?
