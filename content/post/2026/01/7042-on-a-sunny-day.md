Some people hate borders around images, some people love them, some people don't care. 15 years ago, in late January
2011, I decided to try a white border around my images. I ended up using the Lightroom plugin [LR/Mogrify
2](https://photographers-toolbox.com/products/lrmogrify2.php) for that. It always worked perfectly.

Sometime last December it stopped working. It wrote a JPEG, I could open the file everywhere but in Lightroom. I
was annoyed. I tried to reinstall the plugin, tried to download a newer version, but there was none. 

I tried to find a replacement, but couldn't find one. There are all kinds of online services out there, that let you pay
monthly for a border around your photos, and they are a pain to use as well.

Of course, you can do that in Photoshop. Create a white layer below your image and extend the image size. I created an
action for doing that twice. First I create a thin black border, then a 100 px white border. Just as LR/Mogrify 2 had
been set to do. I bound the action to a function key, and then it was as easy as _Edit in Photoshop_, _Cmd+Shift+F1_ and
_File / Quick Export to JPEG_. Problem solved.

Or so I thought. Photoshop decided to strip the caption set by Lightroom. I use that for Creative Commons licensing.
Additionally, it stripped the EXIF data.

It took enough of my time to make it a major annoyance, but I decided to stop resisting. It nagged me, but it was not
worth trying to write a plugin myself.

A few days ago, after an update to Lightroom, I tried [LR/Mogrify
2](https://photographers-toolbox.com/products/lrmogrify2.php) again - and it worked!

The fallout of that episode is, that a few of the next images will have no EXIF data.
