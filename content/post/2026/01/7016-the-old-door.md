I can't remember exactly where this door is. The image has
been taken in the afternoon, and it's the first image taken
on my way from work to the underground station. Maybe it's
even the door of our workplace, but then, the light would
have to be indirect twice. Indirect light it is, that's
obvious from the streaks of shadow.

Sometimes I find out, sometimes not, and often it takes
years until I look at the same spot again and think: "Oh,
that's the place in the picture!"
