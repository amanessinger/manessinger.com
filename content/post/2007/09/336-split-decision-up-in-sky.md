Severely. <br/><br/>There are two images for yesterday, both made within five minutes, just before I dived down into the Underground, on my way to the railway station and then on to Carinthia. I like both, and I'm not gonna choose. I leave it up to you.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070914_153201_nx.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070914_153201_nx.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Both images were shot with the Nikon 18-200 VR, the first one at 200mm and the second at 18mm. Amazing, isn't it? <br/><br/>I wouldn't have been able to change lenses in between, because I shot the images "on the run". Honestly, if <span style="font-weight:bold;">that</span> is not a case for this lens, then I don't know what.<br/><br/>If you thought that two Images of the Day were strange, well, I'll give you two Songs of the Day as well, one for each image. The first one is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/natalie+cole/split+decision_20098155.html" target="_blank">Split Decision</a>" from Natalie Cole's 1987 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Natalie-Cole/dp/B000002H99" target="_blank">Everlasting</a>".<br/><br/>For the second image I came up with something utterly different, "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/o/oasis/up+in+the+sky_20102345.html" target="_blank">Up In The Sky</a>" from  Oasis' 1994 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Definitely-Maybe-Oasis/dp/B000002AS3" target="_blank">Definitely Maybe</a>".<br/><br/>It's now 11am here on a sunny Saturday in Carinthia, and if all goes well, I should be back with another image in the evening.<br/><br/>Have a nice day.
