But that's what I did today.<br/><br/>Yesterday morning I had to go to Klagenfurt and was amazed about the sudden feeling of autumn when I dived into the fog, and today I wanted to repeat the experience. I was only partially successful, I guess you can't repeat experiences like that, because once you've had them, you yourself have changed. There is no way around.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when you live somewhere for a long time, you know your places, and this is one of them. It's an alley at a <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Sankt+Jakob+im+Rosental,+Austria&amp;sll=45.874712,11.447754&amp;sspn=0.459417,0.847321&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=46.538388,14.17356&amp;spn=0.003546,0.00662&amp;t=k&amp;z=18&amp;om=1" target="_blank">small road</a> that leads from Ludmannsdorf down to Feistriz.<br/><br/>I shot all of today's images with the Nikon 18-200 VR, a wonderful lens when you don't look for certain effects but for certain places. Post-processing was done in Capture NX, and I have only slightly driven colors apart, nothing more. I have tried setting a white and black point. The resulting image looked good, but id did not convey the feeling of fog, thus I have abandoned it.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/k/kate+bush/the+fog_20077268.html" target="_blank">The Fog</a>" from Kate Bush's 1989 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sensual-World-Kate-Bush/dp/B0000026IP" target="_blank">The Sensual World</a>" is the Song of the Day.
