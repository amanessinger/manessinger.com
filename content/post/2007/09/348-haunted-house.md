Summer is over. We had various intensities of rain all day, it's getting colder now. By the time it stops - which is expected for next week - the lake will have cooled down so much that even I won't go in any more.<br/><br/>I shot this image in the afternoon, at a time when it just had stopped raining for a while. Again it was the Nikon 18-200 at 80mm, f5, 1/30s and ISO 140. Post-processing was done in Capture NX and Photoshop.<br/><br/>As regards the Song of the Day, it's by Canadian singer Holly Cole again: "The House Is Haunted by the Echo of Your Last Goodbye" from her 2007 self-titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holly-Cole/dp/B000N60HDQ" target="_blank">album</a>. Sorry, neither sound samples nor lyrics are available.
