Well, yesterday may have been the last day this year, that I've been able to do so. It was warm, sunny, with patches of harmless clouds, and I was swimming. Today it seems to be over.<br/><br/>This image is from yesterday afternoon. I was on my way to the lake when I stopped for a completely different image, an image that turned out to be nothing interesting at all, and when I just wanted to stow away the tripod, I looked into the sun, saw the curves, the clouds, and then I knew what image I wanted to take. <br/><br/>I used the Nikon 18-200 at 18mm and f11, from the tripod, with mirror lockup, remote control and Lee split-ND filters.<br/><br/>Had it not been for the filters (I have no adapter for the 72mm thread, so I had to hand hold them), the tripod would not have been necessary. On the other hand, without tripod and mirror lockup you simply can't use a long lens to its full potential. Not that it would matter at this focal length and size, but for some other images I shot at the long end, and especially when peeping at pixels, the difference is obvious.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Stranglers:Always_The_Sun" target="_blank">Always The Sun</a>" is a song from The Stranglers' 1987 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dreamtime-Stranglers/dp/B00005NZHA" target="_blank">Dreamtime</a>".
