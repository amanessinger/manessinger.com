I wasn't very inspired either. What do you do on such a day? Well, I shot the sundown ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/whenthenight.html" target="_blank">When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky</a>", the Song of the Day, is from Bob Dylan's 1985 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Burlesque-Bob-Dylan/dp/B00000264S" target="_blank">Empire Burlesque</a>". It was the first Dylan album that I bought on CD right when it came out. Actually it is not that good. I like the version on disc 3 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bootleg-Vols-1-3-Unreleased-1961-1991/dp/samples/B000002AJG" target="_blank">The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased</a>" much better, and when you want to hear the whole song, why not have a look at a live version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypwPYmregk8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>?
