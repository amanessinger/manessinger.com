The second I had seen this image on the LCD of my D200, I had no doubt at all that this would be the Image of the Day. I didn't even have to change a bit. What you see is the JPEG right out of the camera.<br/><br/>I had got out quite early and weather was fine. This was the third image this morning, again with the Sigma 150/2.8 macro, wide open at f2.8. I had focused at the sunny buildings in the back, thus basically at infinity, trying to get the track going from blurry to defined.<br/><br/>Well, this morning I had all kinds of trouble with this lens. 150mm times 1.5, and that unstabilized, for many applications this is simply impossible. At one point I have tried to shoot upward, the camera over my head, to capture a gorgeous play of light and shadow high on a wall, but even at a minimum shutter speed of 1/100s I could not hold the shot, not even once in maybe ten attempts. I simply need a monopod for such things.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when I get a shot, then it is really something special, just like this one. The shallow DOF of a fast telephoto lens, together with the compression,  that makes for a breathtaking perspective. This is a good example, mostly because of the near curve of the track.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is again from Ray Charles' 1958 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Indeed-Ray-Charles/dp/B0007KVDGS" target="_blank">Yes Indeed!!</a>", again the sound sample is from Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Yes-Indeed-Ray-Charles/dp/B0007KVDGS" target="_blank">German</a> department. It's called "<a href="http://www.lyricsset.com/r/ray_charles_lyrics/get_on_the_right_track_baby_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Get on the Right Track Baby</a>".
