I was even swimming this afternoon. The water is still warm and I'll go again tomorrow.<br/><br/>Photographically I was rather uninspired. When I came home, there was a nice sundown though, and I shot this image using the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/ray-charles-the-suns-gonna-shine-again-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Sun's Gonna Shine Again</a>" by Ray Charles is the Song of the Day. Amazon.com has no sound samples for this album, the 1958 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Indeed-Ray-Charles/dp/B0007KVDGS" target="_blank">Yes Indeed!!</a>", but fortunately the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Yes-Indeed-Ray-Charles/dp/B0007KVDGS" target="_blank">Germans</a> have. Again I scratch my head and wonder.
