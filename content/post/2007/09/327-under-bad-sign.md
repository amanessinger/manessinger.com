Of all of the images I took yesterday morning, this is one of the best, and it was certainly the easiest to process. Talk about artistic processes ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Again this has been shot with the Sigma 30/1.4 at f1.4. Post-processing was done in Capture NX with some final cloning in Photoshop.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cream/born+under+a+bad+sign_20034198.html" target="_blank">Born Under A Bad Sign</a>" from The Cream's 1968 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Fire-Cream/dp/B0000067L3" target="_blank">Wheels of Fire</a>" is the Song of the Day.
