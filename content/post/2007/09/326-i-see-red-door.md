No, actually I don't want it painted black. "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rolling+stones/paint+it+black_20117875.html" target="_blank">Paint It Black</a>" is only the Song of the Day. I wanted to present you Vanessa Carlton, and she sings it really well, but in the end the original won: The Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>This is one song from a time when certain hits were only available as singles. This is one of them. On LP it first appeared on the American version of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aftermath-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006AW2L" target="_blank">Aftermath</a>" - my European version has "Mother's Little Helper" instead. Of course later it was on the major "Greatest Hits" collections. There are many versions on YouTube, the full song very sparsely illustrated <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kl3GeOPKsg" target="_blank">here</a>, or a 1960s live version <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j4XSAX7bWg" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>I shot this image shortly before sundown with the Sigma 30/1.4 at f1.4, ISO 320 and 1/30s. Post-processing was done in Capture NX.
