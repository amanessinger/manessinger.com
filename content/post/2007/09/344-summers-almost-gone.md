We left at 7:10am in bright sunshine and entered dense fog after about 10 km, half way to Klagenfurt.<br/><br/>It's funny. I grew up in that town, and as long as I lived there, I did not know what a beautiful autumn could be. There was fog, always only fog.<br/><br/>Today at 8:10am I left Klagenfurt on the highway A2 along Carinthia's most famous lake, WÃ¶rthersee, heading west. I was sure that the fog would end before the end of the lake, and I was right. In Velden I was able to shoot a series of images of boats in receding fog, this was the one I liked most. Nikon 18-200 at 18mm and f8, shot with a polarizer.<br/><br/>Later this day I was swimming, and it is still possible, but when I'm honest, I have to admit that "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/doors/summer+almost+gone_20257592.html">Summer's Almost Gone</a>". And this is also a song from The Doors' probably most underrated album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waiting-Sun-Doors/dp/B000MCIBB6">Waiting for the Sun</a>".
