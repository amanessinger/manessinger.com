Here we go with a more abstract image. This is a view out of the window of the stairwell in the house where I live. It's the top of a garage building in the patio of the next house. On the wall you see a fire extinguisher that looks a little out of place, because there seems to be nothing that could burn anyway.<br/><br/>I shot it with the Nikon 50/1.8 at f2.8 and ISO 280. Yes, it's that dark these days. We have rain all the time.<br/><br/>It's funny. I just read a discussion in a lens forum the other day. Someone asked if the Nikon 50/1.8 is a recommendable lens, and the answer was "yes", but most people felt the need to point out that 50mm were an awkward length on a crop factor camera. Wrong! It's not about focal length, it's about what you do with it. 50mm is a mild telephoto lens on my D200, equivalent to 75mm on full frame, and I often use it exclusively for days and days. It's not awkward, it's a wonderful focal length for use in a city. They are cluttered anyway.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Sleepy John Estes' 1938 "Fire Department Blues". I have it on  disc 51 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>". Look <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aint-Gonna-Worried-More-1929-1941/dp/B000000G8G" target="_blank">here</a> for a sound sample.
