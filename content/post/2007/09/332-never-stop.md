I had a placeholder here for much too long. This is one of the two images from Monday that I've uploaded to Smugmug, and Monday gave me really a hard time. There were four other images that I had considered, spent time with, and that I've finally set back because they did not turn out as I wanted them.<br/><br/>I shot this image early Monday evening, on my way home. It's our version of a "Don't Stop" sign, a temporary one because there is some kind of construction work going on, and the background is the same shop that gave us "<a href="/2007/03/158-things-as-they-really-are.html" target="_blank">158 - Things as They Really Are</a>" back in March. Oh what a long time ago. This is the Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8, mild post-processing in Capture NX and Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is from Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's classic 1985 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Learn-Sing-Echo-Bunnymen/dp/B000002L8T" target="_blank">Songs to Learn and Sing</a>". It's called "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/echo-and-the-bunnymen-never-stop-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Never Stop</a>".
