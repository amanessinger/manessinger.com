It was beautiful outside, about just before I left work. I still made some shots on my way home, this one being the last of them, glass in the door to the backyard of the house where I live. I took two exposures with different color temperatures, one on "Shade" that looked about like what I saw, the other on "Auto" that got way too blue. Hmmm ... interesting.<br/><br/>In post-processing I took one of the two images and made three different versions, one rather yellow, one in shades of pastels and the last greenish blue. Then I combined them with masks and put a ton of adjustment layers on top. The result does not look exactly like what I saw, but it is frighteningly near to what I imagined ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/mediaeval-baebes-glass-window-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Glass Window</a>" from the MediÃ¦val BÃ¦bes' fourth album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rose-MediÃ¦val-BÃ¦bes/dp/B000063138" target="_blank">The Rose</a>" (the only one that I have yet, I've bought it for the cover, in a shop where I couldn't hear it) is the Song of the Day.
