I was swimming again and so I'll do tomorrow.<br/><br/>On my way to the lake I come by a pair of trees that look interesting, and I have tried to get a good image of them for ages. The problem is, that there are power lines nearby and that it's an awkward place to park the car. Today I halted, parked some way off, went back and tried some angles I had never tried before. The result was not entirely satisfying, but I'll try again tomorrow.<br/><br/>When I went back to the car, I saw this other tree. I shot it with the Nikon 50/1.8 at f4 and 1/320s. Shooting landscape with an equivalent focal length of 75mm is quite interesting. It makes you sensitive for details. If you haven't done it before, try it. It's fun.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is again an instrumental from Stevie Wonder's soundtrack album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Through-Secret-Life-Plants/dp/B000024C7W" target="_blank">The Secret Life Of Plants</a>".

It's called "Tree".
