Finally this image won. Although I did not ask the two people for permission, I risk it and publish the image. The other one I'll post on the Radiant Vista.<br/><br/>I shot this image on my way to the train, just like last Friday on the maybe 500 meters between work and the Underground station, again with the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm and f5.6. It was really shot in a rush. I saw the two people, their body language, took a step to the right to make the girl separate better against the shadow, and that was it. Post-processing was done in Photoshop using Lab color mode and some tricks like different steepness for "a" and "b", and some more.<br/><br/>This is the second day that I have the <a href="http://www.blogrush.com/r85849021" target="_blank">BlogRush</a> widget in my sidebar. My site statistics say, that I've got no hit from them so far, but this may be due to a technical problem. In the last step of their registration they give you the code to insert on your blog and ask you to install it. I did so, obviously it's there, I can see it, I suppose you can see it, it even works and shows links, mostly to photo-related sites ... but still they keep reminding me to install the code. Seemingly their software can't see it.<br/><br/>Well, I've written their customer support an email describing the problem, we'll see if they react. Again, if you see any non-related content in the <a href="http://www.blogrush.com/r85849021" target="_blank">BlogRush</a> widget, please let me know.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/shaggy/chica+bonita_20123692.html" target="_blank">Chica Bonita</a>" is a song from Shaggy's 2000 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hotshot-Shaggy/dp/B00004S7FJ" target="_blank">Hotshot</a>". It's the Song of the Day.
