I took the shot with a quite unusual lens, at least for walking around: my Sigma 150/2.8 macro. Boy, you gotta carry that weight ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>But really, it's not the first time that I say this: it may be an awkward lens for general use in the streets, but it forces you into a completely different way of using your camera. It's amazing: try it at times. Nothing fuels creativity better. Finally, post-processing was entirely done in Capture NX.<br/><br/>Now, so what could be the Song of the Day? Hmmmm ... Well, this was one of the rare cases when I did not have to search for a title or a song at all. It came all by itself.<br/><br/>The Beatles' "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beatles/carry+that+weight_10025915.html" target="_blank">Carry That Weight</a>" from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abbey-Road-Beatles/dp/B000002UB3" target="_blank">Abbey Road</a>" is actually the middle part of an acoustic triptych. Amazon regrettably has no sound samples, and I guess it's not their fault. The Beatles were alway last when it came to new technologies. It took ages until their music was available on CD, and I can vaguely remember having read that they just released it for electronic distribution via the Internet. But of course you can hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlyOmWpgcNw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
