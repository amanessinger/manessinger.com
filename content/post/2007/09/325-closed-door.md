Normally we should have three more weeks of warm late-summer weather, but instead there's what seems to be a solid rain front, and I fear it will kill off what may be left of summer. Snow down to 1000 meters is predicted for Wednesday! I feel betrayed.<br/><br/>Anyway. It was clear it wouldn't last forever, and it could be better next weekend in Carinthia. We'll see.<br/><br/>It was time for the Sigma 30/1.4 again, and I used it around 5:40pm at f1.4, ISO 110 and 1/30s. Speak of a gloomy day.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/roisin-murphy-the-closing-of-the-doors-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The Closing of the Doors</a>" by Róisín Murphy, ex-singer of Moloko, this one being from her solo-debut "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Blue-Roisin-Murphy/dp/B000EQ5PZ0" target="_blank">Ruby Blue</a>".
