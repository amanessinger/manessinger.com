Oh my!<br/><br/>It was not exactly meant to be, but fooling around on another rainy day (third in a row, they begin to speak of high water), I shot this, and now it is my take on Craig's theme week 19, "<a href="http://www.craigtannercreative.com/lightdiary/" target="_blank">Waiting</a>".<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.thelyricarchive.com/lyrics/waiting.shtml" target="_blank">Waiting</a>" is also a song by Green Day. It's from their 2000 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Warning-Green-Day/dp/B00004XQP4" target="_blank">Warning</a>" and, surprisingly enough, it's the Song of the Day ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiKlD7eooyo" target="_blank">here</a> for a video as well.
