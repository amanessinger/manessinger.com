I have tried F-Secure in the morning, but it wouldn't even install. Last thing I did in the morning, was to reinstall Bitdefender. We'll see.<br/><br/>I shot this image in the morning, shortly after leaving home. A big Spiderman, mounted on the wall above a comics shop in Kaiserstra√üe. I used fill flash from the camera's built-in flash. Hmm ... it's clear that there is room for improvement, but in that moment that was the best I could do. Post-processing was done in Capture NX and Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/muddy+waters/mean+red+spider_20260097.html" target="_blank">Mean Red Spider</a>" by Muddy Waters. Again I have it on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>".
