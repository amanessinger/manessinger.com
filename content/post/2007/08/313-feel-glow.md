Maybe I'll catch up tomorrow.<br/><br/>This is the image for Wednesday. When I left work at 7pm the sky was clean and blue, except for a wonderfully impressive cloud that was exactly in front of the sun. Luckily it went away after a short while and I still had some nice late light on the housetops. Again I was using the Nikon 18-200, for this image at 200mm and f8.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is a problem, to say the least. Seeing the image I immediately knew that this must be "Feelin' that Glow" by Roberta Flack, and I was fairly shocked when I found out that I've had this song already for the <a href="/2007/06/229-feelin-that-glow.html" target="_blank">last of May</a>. So what now? After searching for much too long, I decided upon the Robert Johnson classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cream/four+until+late_20034177.html" target="_blank">From Four Until Late</a>", but then, which version? The Cream on "Fresh Cream"? Or better Robert Johnson himself? I settled with the always fabulous Peter Green (with Nigel Watson and the Splinter Group) on the Robert Johnson tribute album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Powder-Peter-Green-Watson-Splinter/dp/B00004S2UU" target="_blank">Hot Foot Powder</a>". I hope you don't mind their guest Dr. John on piano ðŸ™‚
