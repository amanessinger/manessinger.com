This is an old house being renovated. The plaster is almost white and there is not much color at all. Later, in Capture NX, I decided to abandon the high key route and crank up contrast and color.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jethrotull/toooldtorocknrolltooyoungtodie.html" target="_blank">Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll: Too Young To Die</a>" is the Song of the Day. Of course you could always hear it on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Too-Old-Rock-Young-Die/dp/B00006JKOM" target="_blank">original</a> 1976 album, but what I recommend today is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Light-Music-Jethro-Tull/dp/B00000DQNM" target="_blank">A Little Light Music</a>", Jethro Tull's 1992 live album. As someone said, it's about as close to "Tull Unplugged" as you'll get.
