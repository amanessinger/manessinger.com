The place is normally a bus terminal, but at the moment it is closed for construction work, so you have to go around the place. Today I did so as well and, having no image yet, I looked closely. Nikon 50/1.8 at f8, post-processing in Capture NX.<br/><br/>When you have nothing from Nina Simone yet, you must get at least the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tomato-Collection-Nina-Simone/dp/B0000033BF" target="_blank">Tomato Collection</a>", one of the countless "Best Of", as long as it has "My Baby Just Cares for Me", and then the very special "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Women-Simone-Philips-Recordings/dp/B00006ZU6B" target="_blank">Four Women: Nina Simone Philips Recordings</a>" box set. Track 11 on disc 4 of this set is the "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/nina+simone/work+song_20100600.html" target="_blank">Work Song</a>", our Song of the Day.
