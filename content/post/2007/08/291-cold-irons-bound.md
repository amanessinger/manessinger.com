Autofocus is perfect, the lens is still a bit low contrast wide open, but I guess that is to be expected with such a beast, and even at f1.8 it is wickedly sharp. I'm more than delighted. The guys at <a href="http://www.blende7.at/" target="_blank">Blende 7</a> in Westbahnstra√üe simply changed the old with the front-focus problem for a new one, and that was it.<br/><br/>I love this lens. Wide-angle macro opens up a completely new dimension. Having no image of the day yet and not much time, I strolled around the U3/U6 cross "Westbahnhof" (where I shot yesterday's image) for maybe half an hour, got the image you see here, and then many more. I guess I'll post at least one of them at the Radiant Vista <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/community/" target="_blank">community forums</a> as soon as I find some time.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/coldirons.html" target="_blank">Cold Irons Bound</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1997 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Out-Mind-Bob-Dylan/dp/B000002C2E" target="_blank">Time Out Of Mind</a>".
