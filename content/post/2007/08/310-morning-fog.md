I'll blame the fact that this morning we had fog down in the valley to the rain of the last days. This is not a sign of summer ending early, surely it can't be ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I shall go swimming in an hour or two, and I have no idea what images I'll make the rest of the day, but I like this one enough to make it Image of the Day. It's nothing special compositionally or so, but it was a magic moment and I believe the image captures at least a little of it.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Hounds-Love-Kate-Bush/dp/B00004R7TP" target="_blank">The Morning Fog</a>" from Kate Bush's 1985 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Hounds-Love-Kate-Bush/dp/B00004R7TP" target="_blank">Hounds of Love</a>" is the Song of the Day.
