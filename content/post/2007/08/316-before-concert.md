Sonus Brass Ensemble gave "Die Blecharbeiter", a concert for children. I can't give you images from the actual show (though it might be OK for this purpose, but I have not asked), so this is an image of the stage decoration before the show.<br/><br/>The Sigma 150/2.8 macro would have been quite perfect, but I did not bring it along. Instead I have shot most images with the Nikon 50/1.2 or the Nikon 18-200 VR.<br/><br/>Using the 18-200 at 200mm and f5.6 as in this image turned out not completely unreasonable. With the dim pre-concert lighting, this is at ISO 1600, but with Auto-ISO at 1/30s minimum shutter speed and maximum ISO at 1600, exposure correction dialed in at -3EV for the dark stage background, I made most shots during the show at around ISO 250. Of course if you really have to stop down action, 1/30s is not enough, but in a situation where you are not required to get every specific shot, the number of shots that you actually get, is surprisingly high.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is something completely different and only related through the title: "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/fleetwood+mac/before+the+beginning_20054433.html" target="_blank">Before The Beginning</a>" by the early Fleetwood Mac and from their last album with Peter Green, "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Then-Play-Fleetwood-Mac/dp/B000002KOO" target="_blank">Then Play On</a>". <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Then-Play-Fleetwood-Mac/dp/B000002KOO" target="_blank">Amazon.de</a> has the sound sample.
