You need an Image of the Day, and you try, and it won't come. And then, almost by chance, or maybe out of experience, something comes, and finally you see what you haven't seen while trying, and then it is good.<br/><br/>And then there are the times when nothing bothers you, when you don't use a camera but are the camera, the times when all flows freely, when you find not only what you're looking for, no, a whole cosmos of images rotates around you ...<br/><br/>... and once in a while, when you're really lucky, you'll even find a reason to let Morrissey have the Song of the Day. Can it get any better?<br/><br/>Sigma 20/1.8 at f8 and 1/20s, handheld.<br/><br/>Morrissey, former singer of the immortal 1980s band The Smiths, Morrissey, one of my heroes, Morrissey, who had vanished for years, Morrissey, who had come back with "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/You-are-Quarry-Jewel-Case/dp/B0001WAO5S" target="_blank">You are the Quarry</a>", an album that was so fantastic, it made you weep with joy, Morrissey sings "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/morrissey/you+know+i+couldnt+last_20352444.html" target="_blank">You Know I Couldn't Last</a>", the Song of the Day.<br/><br/>No sound samples for Brits and Americans, but the <a href="http://www.amazon.de/You-Are-Quarry-Morrissey/dp/B0001XLXHK" target="_blank">Germans</a> have them. Again, I don't know why, this is completely beyond me.
