I have. The image for yesterday was ready, but I could not find a proper title for it. OK, it was not exactly helpful that I wanted an Elvis song as Song of the Day, but even when I had given up on that idea today, not for the sake of it would I find an inspired title. That's the reason why I finally decided, that this image would have to do without.<br/><br/>Elton John's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goodbye-Yellow-Brick-Road-Elton/dp/B000001DQI" target="_blank">Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</a>" is one of the best albums ever made and The Rolling Stone ranks it #91 in their list of <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time" target="_blank">500 greatest albums</a> ever. I had known many of the songs from the radio when they were hits, had bought the album on vinyl in 1982, and a week ago I finally got it on CD. Incredible that I could have lived without it for so many years. It you can call that a life that is ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.eltonography.com/songs/this_song_has_no_title.html" target="_blank">This Song Has No Title</a>".<br/><br/>Oh yes, Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8. Always a nice lens to use ðŸ™‚
