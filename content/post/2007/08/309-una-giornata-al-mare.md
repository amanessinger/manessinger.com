<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070818_144832_nx_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070818_144832_nx_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Yesterday weather in Austria was drab and rainy, so we made a trip to Italy. Not Venice or Florence, only the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.783926,13.585625&amp;spn=0.115042,0.21183&amp;z=13&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Villaggio del Pescatore</a> between Monfalcone and Trieste, not more than 180km on street from home, but it was enough to give us fine Italian see food, a harbor full of sailing boats, and all that on a warm, decently sunny day.<br/><br/>There was a veil of thin clouds in the sky, so light was mostly flat. Of all the images I made, this is the one I like most. It's funny, I have made many images that day, many that are very controlled and basically came out as pre-visualized, and this is the complete opposite. It is a found image.<br/><br/>This is a very tight crop, and when I was there, I didn't even recognize the patterns that you see here. Post-processing was done in Capture-NX and Photoshop.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/paolo+conte/una+giornata+al+mare_20275612.html" target="_blank">Una Giornata Al Mare</a>" (A Day By The Sea) by Paolo Conte is the Song of the Day. I have it on an album that in the US is distributed as "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Paolo-Conte/dp/B000005S3E" target="_blank">The Best of Paolo Conte</a>" and in Austria only as "Paolo Conte". Fact is, I never knew that it is a best-of album.
