Hmmm ... I think I'm going to ignore it as long as possible, just as every year ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>When I left work at 7pm it was gloomy, and I had already adjusted to the thought of another chess image, but just when I wanted to go for a cab, rain stopped and I decided to use my feet. It drizzled for some more minutes, and then I felt it safe to take the camera out.<br/><br/>I still had the Nikon 50/1.8 mounted when I came by this place in Lindengasse. I took three shots, this being the only survivor. ISO 500 and f4, post-processing in Capture NX.<br/><br/>Nat King Cole's "<a href="http://lyrics.astraweb.com/display/582/nat_king_cole..unknown..night_lights.html" target="_blank">Night Lights</a>" is the Song of the Day. I couldn't find the version I have, so I can only offer you the one on the album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Lights-Nat-King-Cole/dp/B00005IA0F" target="_blank">with Nelson Riddle</a>. Not bad, but decidedly slower and more commercial than the one I have.
