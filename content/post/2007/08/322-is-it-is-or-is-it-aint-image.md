Why do you come back? Or, in other words, if there is merit in my photography, what is it? And if there is, if there is a certain quality that creeps up in my images, at least at times, does this image have it? Or, bluntly put: is this an Image of the Day?<br/><br/>I'm not sure. Sometimes I am, this time I'm not. I was absolutely sure that I have something worthwhile when I made "<a href="/2007/08/320-night-lights.html">320 - Night Lights</a>" or "<a href="/2007/08/316-before-concert.html">316 - Before the Concert</a>", and I got feedback that strongly indicates I was right. On the other hand, I am sure "<a href="/2007/08/305-scene-of-crime.html">305 - The Scene Of The Crime</a>" is one of my best images, yet there was no reaction at all ... hmm ... makes me wonder.<br/><br/>Here I am not sure. Not that I have much choice, it's Friday, traveling day, and this either is the Image of the Day or there ain't one, but still, I wonder if it is up to the "standard", if indeed there is one? The problem is, I have made images like this for years and I have made them over and again. This is a kind of image, that I've shot so many times, that I feel like plagiarizing myself. Still, it accords to the rules of composition and, what's more important, it pleases me. Does it you? And if not, why not??<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/diana+krall/is+you+is+or+is+you+aint+my+baby_20040000.html" target="_blank">Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby</a>" by Anita O'Day is the Song of the Day. I have it on Anita's 1963 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Once-Upon-Summertime-Anita-ODay/dp/B0000017E0" target="_blank">Once Upon a Summertime</a>". Sorry, there seem to be no sound samples on the net, but on YouTube I've found a clip from a 1986 concert, and here it is:<br/><br/><center><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UUfvsWoLK08"/><param name="wmode" value="transparent"/><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UUfvsWoLK08" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent"/></object></center>
