When post-processing it, I suddenly had the idea to turn it around. Conceptionally it made not much of a difference, because the camera-recorded orientation of an image shot upwards is random anyway, but suddenly it looked even more strange. It began to remind me of an image of two high-rise buildings watched from a third, kind of a modern Tower of Babylon, or at least rather two of them. I began to accentuate the banding structure that was already there, and to drive colors apart. This is the final result.<br/><br/>The Image was shot with a D200, a Sigma 20/1.8 at f8, and it was post-processed in Capture NX and Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Edoardo Bennato's "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/edoardo-bennato-la-torre-di-babele-lyrics.html" target="_blank">La torre di babele</a>" from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Torre-Di-Babele-Edoardo-Bennato/dp/B00000G64F" target="_blank">1976 album</a> of the same name. Instead of a sound sample I can only offer a <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2r4cj_edoardo-bennato-torre-di-babele_music" target="_blank">video</a> from a live concert in Bari, Italy. Not too bad either ðŸ™‚
