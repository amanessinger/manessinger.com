I used it for a trip to Burgenland, where in the quarry of <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=47.801164,16.640167&amp;spn=0.187257,0.451126&amp;z=12&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Sankt Margarethen</a>, one of the biggest and oldest in Europe, every summer an opera festival takes place. This year they show Verdi's "<a href="http://www.ofs.at/" target="_blank">Nabucco</a>", yesterday evening I saw it, and I was utterly impressed. It's a fantastic production and more than worth seeing.<br/><br/>But that's not the only thing to see in Sankt Margarethen. The quarry is used by sculptors and their works are liberally scattered all over the place. This is one of those sculptures on a hill a little east of the quarry and overlooking Burgenland's big lake Neusiedler See.<br/><br/>Nick Cave has given us four Songs of the Day so far, and today we have another one: "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/nick+cave/rock+of+gibraltar_20100063.html" target="_blank">Rock Of Gibraltar</a>", a love song with a twist, from his 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nocturama-Nick-Cave-Bad-Seeds/dp/B00007MB8N" target="_blank">Nocturama</a>".
