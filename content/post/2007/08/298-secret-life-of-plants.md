This time I did. I had it on vinyl, long ago. Does that count? The CD is already ordered.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, that I was sure to have it anyway. I would have sworn. OK, now that's it for today: Stevie Wonder's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/stevie+wonder/the+secret+life+of+plants_20131833.html" target="_blank">The Secret Life Of Plants</a>" from the 1979 double <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Through-Secret-Life-Plants/dp/B000024C7W" target="_blank">album</a> of the same name. There are no sound samples on Amazon.com/co.uk/ca, but <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Journey-Through-Secret-Life-Plants/dp/B000024C7W" target="_blank">Amazon.de</a> has them, albeit in rather poor quality, and <a href="http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/window/media/page/0,,187981-133885-WMLO,00.html" target="_blank">ARTISTdirect</a> has them as well.<br/><br/>I shot this image in the morning on my way to work. By chance a house entrance was open and I saw green in the backyard. Sometimes I ask myself why I lug all these lenses around: it's of course the Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8 again, but I think you may have guessed by now.
