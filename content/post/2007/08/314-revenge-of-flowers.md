I was on my way home, when I saw this scratched graffito on a door. The door was of a subtle shade of blue, the scratches revealed layers of color below, among them a pale yellow. Now, Ted, will the dogs see it? I certainly hope so so ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>One wouldn't assume it, but in my more than 19,000 music tracks that I have on my hard drive, I fine very few with "flower" in the title. "Revenge Of The Flowers" is one of them, and it is a song from Malcolm McLaren's 1994 album "<a href="hittp://www.amazon.co.uk/Paris-Australian-Malcolm-Mclaren/dp/B000025GJJ" target="_blank">Paris</a>". We already had this album <a href="/2007/01/92-jazz-is-paris-paris-is-jazz.html" target="_blank">once</a>, and I still stand to my verdict that this is a stellar album, a masterpiece, a must-have.<br/><br/>Amazon has no sound sample, but what about the original video clip? Did I ever say I love <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn3w2nbzQYQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>?
