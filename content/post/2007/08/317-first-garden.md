A little snail on a fern, shot with the Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is again from Stevie Wonder's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Through-Secret-Life-Plants/dp/B000024C7W" target="_blank">The Secret Life Of Plants</a>". It's instrumental, has birds, lots of birds, and it is called as this image.
