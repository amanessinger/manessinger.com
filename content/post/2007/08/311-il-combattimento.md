In the morning I was in a hurry and didn't make a single photo, in the afternoon on my way back home I couldn't, in the evening I had no time, and so I began around 11pm to set up a game of chess, two flashes of my macro flash kit and the camera on tripod. At first I tried my luck with the Sigma 20/1.8 wide open and very near, but that didn't work too well, at least I found nothing that excited me. I was already determined to use an archive image for today, when I finally decided to try one more shot with the Sigma 150/2.8 macro. About 20 shots later I had what you see here.<br/><br/>This is no real game any more, but photography has other rules than chess. I did a lot of shuffling around with the chess pieces and the flashes until I had this configuration. Actually I like it, I enjoyed the experience and I expect to get back to chess on another rainy day.<br/><br/>What really took time, was not taking the image, was not processing it in Photoshop, what took me time was finding a decent sound sample from one of the recordings of Claudio Monteverdi's "<a href="http://opera.stanford.edu/iu/libretti/combatt.html" target="_blank">Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda</a>". This is probably the most dramatic music Monteverdi has ever written, and I was lucky to find a sample from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monteverdi-Combatimento-Tancredi-Clorinda-Florissants/dp/B0000007H0" target="_blank">William Christie and Les Arts Florissants</a>. I'm always amazed by how good Christie is. Whenever I compare recordings of something baroque and operatic, and whenever Les Arts Florissants are in the game, they usually end up among the three best, and frequently they are my favorites.<br/><br/>The sound sample is only from the beginning, but the drama builds up fast enough to give you at least a hint of what this really is.
