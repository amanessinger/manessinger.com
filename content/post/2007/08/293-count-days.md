I had a placeholder entry here, saying that I finally got the image that I had already wanted for Wednesday. I had even had a title, but when I processed the images taken Thursday morning, I had to admit that it was another miss. I'll try it a third time Monday or Tuesday. We'll see.<br/><br/>This image was taken in the afternoon when I went swimming. It's of course the Sigma 20/1.8 again.<br/><br/>We already had Marcia Ball in "<a href="/2007/07/268-fly-on-wall.html" target="_blank">268 - Fly On The Wall</a>", and here she is again: "Count the Days" from either her 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presumed-Innocent-Marcia-Ball/dp/B00005B1DL" target="_blank">Presumed Innocent</a>" or the live album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-Down-Road-Marcia-Ball/dp/B0007YMV2O" target="_blank">Live! Down the Road</a>". Sorry, no lyrics available.
