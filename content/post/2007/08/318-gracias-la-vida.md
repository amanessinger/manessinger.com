The relative hides the absolute, and we have the impertinence to be able to feel unhappy in all our abundance. Yes, it's OK, it's almost perfect, but ... just a tiny bit ...<br/><br/>I feel I should say thanks to life.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/Strasse/1791/chile/gracias.html" target="_blank">Gracias a la vida</a>" in the version by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gracias-Vida-Joan-Baez/dp/B000006SNG" target="_blank">Joan Baez</a>, a track from her 1974 album of the same name is the Song of the Day.
