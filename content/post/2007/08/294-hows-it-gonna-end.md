We already had tickets, we knew it would be fantastic (it was <a href="http://www.mnozilbrass.at/" target="_blank">Mnozil Brass</a> after all), and still, we were tired and stayed home. <a href="/2007/06/231-up-so-close.html" target="_blank">Raimund</a> will kill me for that, I'm sure. He preaches the Gospel of Mnozil Brass all the time, and it does not make any difference that I have all their records, you must see them, he says. Oh well.<br/><br/>So, instead of driving to Villach and seeing the concert, I went into the garden and took some photos. One of them is here. We live on a hill, and this fence runs from our garden fence down the hill. It's again the Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/tom-waits-hows-it-gonna-end-lyrics.html" target="_blank">How's It Gonna End</a>" from Tom Waits' 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Gone-Tom-Waits/dp/B0002SDKG6" target="_blank">Real Gone</a>" is the Song of the Day.
