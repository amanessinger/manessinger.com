Exactly to avoid this, I had originally created my index of Songs of the Day. Seems like it's time to actually consult it.<br/><br/>I had no really usable image today, thus shortly before midnight I decided to go out for a walk around the block, armed with the Sigma 20/1.8. I shot this image at f1.8, ISO 1250 and 1/4s, so you see it was really dark. Post-processing was done in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Paolo Conte's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/paolo+conte/midnights+knock+out_20253218.html" target="_blank">Midnight's Knock Out</a>" from the 1996 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Bailando-Paolo-Conte/dp/B000006XRO" target="_blank">Jimmy Bailando</a>". See <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Jimmy-Bailando-Paolo-Conte/dp/B000006XRO" target="_blank">here</a> for a sound sample.
