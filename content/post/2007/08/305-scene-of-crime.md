Incidentally it's a camera shop ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I got interested for two reasons: the light behind the glass and some pale, reddish spots of paint round the sill. I thought, hmm ... these spots could be much more prominent ...<br/><br/>I had the Sigma 10-20 already mounted, and I took the shot at 10mm, f8 and an angle for maximum distortion of the frame. Later, in Capture NX I rearranged contrasts, and most of all I turned the paint into blood. Finally I took out some high contrast distractions in Photoshop. That's it.<br/><br/>I have to bother you with Marcia Ball's album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presumed-Innocent-Marcia-Ball/dp/B00005B1DL" target="_blank">Presumed Innocent</a>" for the second time in a row, for the fourth time at all. Hope you don't mind that her "Scene Of The Crime" is the Song of the Day.
