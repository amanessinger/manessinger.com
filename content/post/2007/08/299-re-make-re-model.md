I took three images with the Sigma 20/1.8, this one at f1.8 and focusing very near, exactly on the logo. I was in a hurry to get to work, and only afterwards I saw how good it turned out. I have cropped the image slightly from the right, just to let another curve come out of a corner, but everything else is as out of the camera. I love the repetition of flame-like shapes all over, just see at what the bokeh does to the piece of sky between grip and brake lever, and then again above.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/roxy+music/remakeremodel_20118922.html" target="_blank">Re-make / Re-model</a>" is from one of the best debut albums ever, Roxy Music's 1972 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000256KG" target="_blank">Roxy Music</a>". A stellar burst of creativity, a must-have, the first of the two Roxy Music albums with Brian Eno. It never got better.
