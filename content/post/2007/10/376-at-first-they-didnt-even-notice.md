I used the tramway for half of the way, and when I got back on the street, it poured like mad, taking away much of the fun in photographing.<br/><br/>I shot this image when the tramway was already approaching, mostly because of the graffiti and because I wanted to use the image as part of another comics style image. I still wanted to when I began working on the image in the evening, but I soon recognized that it could very well stand for itself.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 40mm, f6.7, ISO 1600 and 1/6s, handheld. Post-processing in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/tom-waits-small-change-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Small Change</a>" by Tom Waits. I have it on a collection called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Asylum-Years-Tom-Waits/dp/B0000075XE" target="_blank">The Asylum Years</a>", but originally of course it's from the 1990 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Tom-Waits/dp/B000002GY9" target="_blank">Small Change</a>".
