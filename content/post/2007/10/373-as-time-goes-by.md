A little bit like April. This morning was cool but wonderful, and as time went by, weather conditions constantly changed. Here I have prepared two images as seen from our garden, the upper one from 11am, the lower one from 2:45pm. Quite a difference, aye?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.reelclassics.com/Movies/Casablanca/astimegoesby-lyrics.htm" target="_blank">As Time Goes By</a>", yes, the one from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Casablanca-Lauren-Bacall/dp/6305736650" target="_blank">Casablanca</a>", and it's the most unusual version you could think of: MÃ­sia sings it on her 1999 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fado-Misia/dp/B00002DEB6" target="_blank">Fado</a>". Hear the sound sample at Amazon's <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Fado-Misia/dp/B00002DEB6" target="_blank">German site</a>.
