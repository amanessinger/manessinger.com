I actually shot some of these images, but finally had to admit that it really was nothing but more of the same, and consequently I abandoned the notion. Luckily I had shot some images in the morning, this one being probably passable.<br/><br/>Sigma 30/1.4 at f8 and 1/125s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beatles/good+morning+good+morning_10026571.html" target="_blank">Good Morning, Good Morning</a>" by The Beatles. It's of course from  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sgt-Peppers-Lonely-Hearts-Club/dp/B000002UAU" target="_blank">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>".
