Andreas, you must be joking! Not a Movie of the Day now!!<br/><br/>Movie of the Day? Hmm ... tempting ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Well, no, I'll spare us that. But should I have called it "<a href="http://www.absolutelyrics.com/lyrics/view/kate_bush/mrs._bartolozzi/" target="_blank">Mrs. Bartolozzi</a>"? Why I would? Because this is the Song of the Day. It's from Kate Bush's latest album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aerial-Kate-Bush/dp/B000BHNLX0" target="_blank">Aerial</a>", a mature masterpiece.<br/><br/>With this image I'm back to the Nikon 50/1.8, my cheapest lens and one of the best. F9.5, ISO 500, 1/30s. Don't ask me why I did not open up to f4. Sometimes these things happen.<br/><br/>Post-processing was done in Capture NX and then in Photoshop for cloning out some leaves of a nearby tree.
