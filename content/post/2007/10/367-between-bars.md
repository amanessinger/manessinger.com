Up to now, clicking on an image brought you to my SmugMug gallery, and when you clicked there again, you could probably have got a bigger version. Or maybe not. This was confusing and not very useful. From now on, clicking on an image always brings you directly to a big version. Try it with this image and you'll see. The catch is, that this will only work with new images. <br/><br/>These big versions are bigger than anything I have displayed yet. Ah you say, beware, people steal images, but I say I want my images to be seen. If sometimes one gets "stolen", so what? <br/><br/>I shot the image this afternoon with the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm and f8. This is a park left of our Parliament (as seen from Ringstra√üe) and there is a ramp down into the underground garage with railings on both sides. I shot the image through the bars of both railings, that's what the vertical stripes are.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/madeleine-peyroux-between-the-bars-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Between the Bars</a>" from Madeleine Peyroux' 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NRRAG" target="_blank">Careless Love</a>".
