Of what I've got, this lousy hydrant seemed still the best ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Honestly, this hydrant haunted me for months. I really like the shrill yellow warning color on black, but this thing stands in the probably least photogenic of environments in all Vienna. Now, here we are, reduced to the bare minimum.<br/><br/>Today I'll be off to Carinthia for a week. Weather is forecast to be rather bad, but we will see.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Nick-Cave/Hallelujah.html" target="_blank">Hallelujah</a>" from Nick Cave's 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-More-Shall-We-Part/dp/B00005AU5E" target="_blank">No More Shall We Part</a>".
