Nice bokeh, aye? Post-processing in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Jay Leonhart's "Kentucky Wild Flower" from the 1983 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Salamander-Pie-Jay-Leonhart/dp/B000003DCI" target="_blank">Salamander Pie</a>". That's an amazing record, not the least for its audio quality. In its days it was the reference CD of some German audio and HiFi magazines. Sorry, no lyrics available.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, my site statistics say that I got my first visitor from that <a href="http://www.blogrush.com/r85849021" target="_blank">BlogRush</a> widget in the sidebar. At least the first one where the browser sent a referer. A majority has that disabled nowadays, so we can't tell where they come from. At least <a href="http://www.blogrush.com/r85849021" target="_blank">BlogRush</a> seems to work now and I have not seen any SPAM coming up any more either. This means I'll keep it. Actually I use it myself and have even found some interesting stuff.
