This is an image I shot in the morning in Vienna while waiting for the tramway to the railway station. It's the light in a phone booth.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/led+zeppelin/dazed+confused_20081897.html" target="_blank">Dazed And Confused</a>" is a song from Led Zeppelin's 1969 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Led-Zeppelin-1/dp/B000002J01" target="_blank">Led Zeppelin</a>". Wonder why I chose that??
