This image is from 10:46 am, when the low fog had cleared up, shortly before the high fog came and covered the view again.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is a quiet little piece of art by Beth Orton, "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/beth-orton-pieces-of-sky-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Pieces Of Sky</a>" from her fourth album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Comfort-Strangers-Beth-Orton/dp/B000CBSHK2" target="_blank">Comfort of Strangers</a>". Funny when you look at the ratings on Amazon's site: this album seems to have been a stylistic turning point. People either love it or hate it. See the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrtOq-H1MrM" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and judge for yourself.
