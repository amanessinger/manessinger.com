I mean slow, silent moves. Silent not in the sense that there would be no sound, no, I mean movies that take their time. Movies where between scenes the screen fades to black, movies that don't scream "ACTION!!!" in your face, movies like Jim Jarmusch's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Down-Law-Collection-Vernel-Bagneris/dp/B00005JKFX" target="_blank">Down by Law</a>" or  David Lynch's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Straight-Story-Sissy-Spacek/dp/B00004Z4SD" target="_blank">The Straight Story</a>". These movies teach us to see, and sometimes even to live.<br/><br/>This afternoon I was in the restaurant <a href="http://www.ufertaverne.at/" target="_blank">Ufertaverne</a>, sitting on the covered middle terrace, half in the shadow, took my time to see, and to listen to the silence.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200, 105mm at f5.3 and 1/160s. Straight from the camera.<br/><br/>"Silence" is a song by bassist Charlie Haden. I have it on his Liberation Music Orchestra masterpiece "The Ballad of the Fallen", but today we need the much more contemplative version on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magico-Jan-Garbarek/dp/B0000261XT" target="_blank">Magico</a>", recorded in 1979 with Egberto Gismonti and Jan Garbarek.
