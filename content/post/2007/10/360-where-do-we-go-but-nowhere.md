This is the image of Monday, I'm back in Vienna.<br/><br/>It does not happen very often that I fully pre-visualize an image. Most of my images are found. This is one such exception. A thread at the Radiant Vista forums gave me the idea. <a href="http://www.mikesjournal.com/" target="_blank">Michael Campbell</a> from Toronto had taken an image of a <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/community/showthread.php?t=4732" target="_blank">fountain</a> in a shopping mall, slowing down the water with lots of neutral density filters. He found a peculiar pattern of people watching the fountain being sharp and those passing by blurry and ghost-like.<br/><br/>This inspired me to go to Mariahilfer Stra√üe, one of Vienna's most busy streets, at sundown, put the camera on a tripod, pointing just above people's heads, use f13, ISO 100 and a polarizer to slow down to 3 seconds exposure. I figured that people would blend into an anonymous mass of ghosts at the ground of a sea of shop's signs and advertisements. I took about 10 exposures and this is the one I liked most.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once more by Nick Cave: "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/wheredowegonowbutnowhere.html" target="_blank">Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere</a>" from the 1997 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boatmans-Call-Nick-Cave-Seeds/dp/B000002NE4" target="_blank">The Boatman's Call</a>".
