We've come quite some way together, from very literal beginnings to a much greater freedom of expression now. Am I weary? No ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>We had high fog today that lasted until well after noon. I made three attempts at photographing, a macro session in the morning, a garden session just when the sun came out, and finally the results came with the afternoon session when I took the car for the wider surroundings.<br/><br/>This image was shot with the Nikon 18-200 at 18mm and f11. It is an HDR image merged from seven exposures and tone mapped in Photomatix Pro. You may or may not like the particular style that I chose, but one thing is for sure: without HDR this would not have been an image at all.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is of course Stevie Wonder's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/stevie+wonder/happy+birthday_20131794.html" target="_blank">Happy Birthday</a>", originally on the 1980 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hotter-Than-July-Stevie-Wonder/dp/B00004SZWB" target="_blank">Hotter Than July</a>".
