I have uploaded two of yesterday's images to SmugMug, and I could not decide. Again I went with the music.<br/><br/>Here we are. I shot this image yesterday on my way from work (night falls early now, yikes!), using the Nikon 18-200 at f8, 1/8s and ISO 720. Not overly high ISO but plenty of noise, as I've accidentally underexposed by a stop. Anyway, I used Noise Ninja, a beauty blur (not with the original image blurred, but with a tone mapped version), a radial blur and some of the usual stuff.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Cole Porter's "All Through The Night" from Charlie Haden's fantastic 1996 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hour-Charlie-Haden-Quartet-West/dp/B00000471A" target="_blank">Now Is the Hour</a>". Looking at the album cover you will most likely think of Alfred Eisenstaedt's famous image (see the interesting back-story <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/that-times-square-smooch-right-to-the-kisser/" target="_blank">here</a>), but it isn't the original. For whatever reason they have made a similar image for the album cover.
