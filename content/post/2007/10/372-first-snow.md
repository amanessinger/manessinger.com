OK, the water temperature was far from optimal, to be honest it was damn cold, but it was a warm, sunny day and I was swimming in the lake, only for two minutes, but still swimming was ... cool.<br/><br/>Only a week ago. Now, this morning we had snow. Not much, on first sight you could have taken it for frozen dew, but in was definitely snow. When I went out to take some images, the sun suddenly came up over the fog. I shot this image 50 meters from our house, using the Nikon 18-200 at 18mm, f13 and 1/50s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "First Snow In Kokomo" from Aretha Franklin's 1971 masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Young-Gifted-Black-Aretha-Franklin/dp/B00000335M" target="_blank">Young, Gifted and Black</a>".
