Maybe not, but somehow I can't help it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Of all things Punk, I probably value nothing more than a record that came more than fifteen years after everything was over. It's the Sex Pistols' 1996 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Filthy-Lucre-Live-Sex-Pistols/dp/B000000WBY" target="_blank">Filthy Lucre Live</a>" ("fat, fourty and back", says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lydon" target="_blank">John Lydon</a>). Well, maybe it's only a sign that I was too young for the Real Thing, but whatever it is, this album is pretty unbelievable. And like the whole Punk culture it is also pretty vacant. If Punk has ever failed to provide a thing, then it was answers. "No Future" is not much of an answer, is it? <br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/sex+pistols/pretty+vacant_20123600.html" target="_blank">Pretty Vacant</a>" in this 1996 version. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOpY6gkDhaM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/>I shot this image on my way to the train for Carinthia, Nikon 18-200 at 48mm, f4.5, ISO 900 and 1/8s. I seem to have a steady hand these days ðŸ™‚
