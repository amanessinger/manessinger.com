Actually you can see the ghost of him in this image, on the right side, just in the middle, standing left of the trash can. Well, it's probably a little bit small in this size, and I only recognized it when I worked on the image.<br/><br/>It was a magic moment. The sky in the east had only lightened up a little, when suddenly a cloud up in the sky began to glow. I was working from the tripod, shooting the Battisterio while Ted worked on the on the facade of the Duomo.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/steviewonder/ifitsmagic.html" target="_blank">If It's Magic</a>" from Stevie Wonder's 1976 masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Key-Life-Stevie-Wonder/dp/B00004SZWD" target="_blank">Songs in the Key of Life</a>".
