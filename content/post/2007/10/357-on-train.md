I shot it on the train from Vienna to Carinthia, through a compartment door with stripes of frosted glass, through the window of the train and into the sun. Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8, 1/8000s and ISO 180. The train was running at 100 mph.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/los-lobos-that-train-dont-stop-here-lyrics.html" target="_blank">That Train Don't Stop Here</a>" by Los Lobos. I have it on an album called "Run Away With You" that ... hmm ... doesn't seem to exist?? Well, at least I can't find it anywhere, but fortunately the song is also on "<a href="http://www.rhino.com/store/ProductDetail.lasso?Number=73294" target="_blank">Wolf Tracks: The Best Of Los Lobos</a>".<br/><br/>There will be an Image of the Day for today, but I won't be posting it before Sunday night. I'm off to Florence, Italy for a night to meet <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/09/anniversary.html" target="_blank">Ted Byrne</a> ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>See you on Sunday. Have a good weekend.
