<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071006_191849_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20071006_191849_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Hello again, I'm safely back from Firenze and my meeting with Ted Byrne. The trip down there was unspectacular, though I would have preferred a little less rain. Actually we had rain for almost the whole drive, with a little sun near Bologna. Anyway, rain stopped shortly before Firenze and from then on, including today's journey back, we had beautiful weather.<br/><br/>We arrived just in time for dinner with Ted, so I had not much time for shooting on Saturday. This is one of the two images I keep, taken just before dinner, just out of the restaurant <a href="http://www.nanamuta.it/" target="_blank">Nanamuta</a> where we met, a hotel on the other side of the street.<br/><br/>Dinner was fine and so was finally talking with Ted. If you're watching his blog, he's got internet access again and just has begun posting again.<br/><br/>The other keeper is a street scene from after dinner, shadows and light, the last image I shot on Saturday. I had considered wandering around on the nightly streets for a little longer, but decided against it. Ted and I had arranged to meet for sunrise on the corner of Firenze's cathedral, and I imagined that some sleep would not be completely out of place ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Firenze, one of the centers of Rinascimento, and I come back with a piece of modern architecture? Well, this shall be remedied with Sunday's image. I have not decided yet, but I guess it will be one of those from the morning session with Ted.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day should probably be one of the pieces on Mina's new CD "<a href="http://www.minamazzini.com/todavia/" target="_blank">Todavia</a>". I bought the album on the Italian highway and heard it in the car, but I would not be able to offer you sound samples and none of the tracks would match this image anyway.<br/><br/>Instead it's "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/the-boomtown-rats-shes-so-modern-lyrics.html" target="_blank">She's So Modern</a>" by The Boomtown Rats. I have it on the collection "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Loudmouth-Best-Boomtown-Bob-Geldof/dp/B000006YYA" target="_blank">Loudmouth : Best Of The Boomtown Rats</a>".
