Congratulations, we're are in the same club ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I have processed two images of today, with at least three or four others worth trying, four are left from yesterday, three from Sunday, and when I think that I've promised Ted to post more images from Firenze, I really get dizzy. Oh well.<br/><br/>Today's choice between this image and a wacky self portrait was not easy, but what finally made it clear was the music. Searching for something about beauty, preferably beauty and time, crackling beauty, or anything like that, I stumbled upon Annie Lennox' hilarious "<a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Annie_Lennox:Keep_Young_And_Beautiful" target="_blank">Keep Young And Beautiful</a>", and that was it. This is the last song on her 1992 solo debut "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Diva-Annie-Lennox/dp/B000002VMH" target="_blank">Diva</a>". See the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrpHbTZ_jL8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
