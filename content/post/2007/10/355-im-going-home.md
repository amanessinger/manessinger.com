Consequently I went for colors, and I did it with the Sigma 30/1.4, most of the time and here as well at f1.4. This is the underside of a shop's marquee in LerchenfelderstraÃŸe.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "I'm Goin Home" from Dr. John's 2004 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/NAwlinz-Dis-dUdda-Dr-John/dp/B0001XQ6FE" target="_blank">N'Awlinz: Dis Dat or d'Udda</a>". No lyrics needed, the title is all that gets repeated ðŸ™‚
