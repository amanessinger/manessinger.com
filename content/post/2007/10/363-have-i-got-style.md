I have commented on the second, basically saying that a distinct style may be helpful for being commercially successful, but that this is mostly due to the fact that art buyers buy art just like they buy soft drinks: they buy brands. In the art market style and brand could be used almost interchangeably.<br/><br/>On the other hand, for the artist, adhering to a strict style for the rest of one's career basically means petrification. It is certainly prudent from an accountant's point of view (why taking risks once you have found something that sells?), but this kind of art is not art any more. It is reproduction, without joy and passion, it becomes a job. In other words: Style is for the dead.<br/><br/>This image is made in the style of another Image of the Day, "<a href="/2007/03/153-passage.html" target="_blank">153 - Passage</a>". Sigma 30/1.4 at f8, shot yesterday morning, post-processed in Photoshop using two versions from RAW with different color temperatures.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.sweetslyrics.com/329327.De-Phazz%20-%20Style.html" target="_blank">Style</a>" from De-Phazz's 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Lama-Phazz/dp/B00006L6YE" target="_blank">Daily Lama</a>".
