I'm afraid you'll have to bear with me, I can't help it.<br/><br/>This is the entry for Wednesday. In the evening we were out to a restaurant with the company. By now the guys are accustomed to me photographing all the time, and that's good because it makes for relaxed portraits like this one of Gerhard, my boss.<br/><br/>Nikon 50/1.2 at f1.2, 1/60s and ISO 1600, ambient light, white balance manually set to 2500K.<br/><br/>We were at the Italian restaurant "<a href="http://www.sestante.at/" target="_blank">Il Sestante</a>" in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=vienna,+austria+Piaristengasse&ie=UTF8&ll=48.209889,16.350832&spn=0.006942,0.013239&z=17&om=1" target="_blank">Piaristengasse</a> in Vienna's 8<sup>th</sup> district. They serve a divine "zuppa di pesce". If you're in Vienna, go try it yourself. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Billy Joel's "<a href="http://www.lyricsdepot.com/billy-joel/scenes-from-an-italian-restaurant.html" target="_blank">Scenes From An Italian Restaurant</a>" from his 1977 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Billy-Joel/dp/B00000DCHC" target="_blank">The Stranger</a>".
