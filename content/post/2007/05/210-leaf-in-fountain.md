There is a small fountain meant for drinking that often catches my eye. In its small basin, cast of brass and only slightly more than a foot in diameter, I found this leaf.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://underthegreenhill.blogspot.com/2004/10/slants-on-autumn.html" target="_blank">Fallen Leaves</a>" (the only place I found the lyrics was on Simon Telford's blog, scroll all way down) from Norma Waterson's fantastic album "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Very-Thought-You-Norma-Waterson/dp/B0000258GB" target="_blank">The Very Thought of You</a>". For a sound sample I have to direct you to Amazon in Germany. They have it readily available as import from Canada, Amazon.ca has it only via marketplace dealers, and Amazon in the US does not have it at all. Isn't globalization a wonderful thing ðŸ™‚
