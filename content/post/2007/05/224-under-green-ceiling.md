I sat there under the chestnut trees, watched people and the multitude of different roses, and when I looked up I saw a fantastic ceiling made of intricate ornaments in infinite shades of green. I used the Nikon 50/1.8 at f4.<br/><br/>I have tried processing this image in Photoshop, and I had quite some trouble bringing out contrast in the darker parts of the image. I tried it again in Nikon Capture NX and, what a difference! In less time I got a much better result. We'll see another example for Capture NX's power in Saturday's entry.<br/><br/>The sky was not burnt out, but it almost looked as if, thus I decided to blend in some color where the image is neither green nor yellow. This, of course, I did in Photoshop's Lab mode by using a "Solid Color" layer in "Multiply" and the "Blend If" sliders of the advanced "Blending Options".<br/><br/>As for a Song of the Day, I'm not very objective when it comes to Irish singer Mary Coughlan. I simply adore her and her melancholy way of singing. Searching for "green" in my music library got me "My Land Is Too Green" from either her "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-Galway-Mary-Coughlan/dp/B000002XXW" target="_blank">Live in Galway</a>" album (see for a sound sample) or from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Under-Influence-Mary-Coughlan/dp/B00002626B" target="_blank">Under the Influence</a>".
