I had the Nikon 18-200 mounted and that was OK. I tried some wide-angle shots first, but the poppies grow directly under a high-voltage power supply line, and that restricts the number of usable wide angles severely ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I finally settled with a telephoto shot at f11 and 200mm. I like the compression, I like the tilt and the image is right from the camera. In hindsight I should have cleaned up a little, and probably I'll do so if I find some time.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Popity Pop" from Lambert, Hendricks' &amp; Ross' 1959 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hottest-New-Group-Jazz/dp/B000002ADR" target="_blank">The Hottest New Group in Jazz</a>". Hear the sample and don't tell me you expect lyrics ðŸ™‚
