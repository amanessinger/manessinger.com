One ignition coil was defective. In the meantime I got a replacement car and used the time to shoot some images in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=austria,+klagenfurt&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=65.772864,85.957031&ie=UTF8&ll=46.6182,14.258709&spn=0.056949,0.083942&z=14&om=1" target="_blank">Europapark</a>, the beautiful park near WÃ¶rthersee. I've been there <a href="/2006/11/35-embroidery.html" target="_blank">last fall</a>, but this time it was all flowers and blossoms.<br/><br/>I'm always trying to go to extremes, and this time the concept was to use the ultra-wide Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and f4, but in the fashion of a macro, i.e. by going very near and, most important, focusing very near. This way I managed to get some reduced depth of field. There was so much light that I decided to use a polarizer as well. Tough job for automatic white balance, and as could be expected, it failed miserably. Anyway, that's the advantage of shooting RAW, so no problem.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Song Of The Jungle Stream" from Carla Bley's 1973 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropic-Appetites-Carla-Bley/dp/B000024BC3" target="_blank">Tropic Appetites</a>".
