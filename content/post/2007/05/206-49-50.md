So much for titles ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I have not used this lens in quite a while and I am a little bit unhappy with this image. Not because of the lens, but because this is a snapshot. I took it while walking, without much consideration, and when I later found out that I like the composition, I saw with despair that I had shot at f1.8 into the blinding sunlight. Don't ask.<br/><br/>Anyway. I still like the image. At least focus is where it should be.<br/><br/>It was a bit hard to get it to look like this, because the original from out of the camera was all contrast and almost no color, with the streetcar almost black. I tried my best in Photoshop and finally had to give up: it would not work, no way, regardless of what I did.<br/><br/>Enter Capture NX. Goodness, how I love this program! I don't use it often, but whenever I do, I am amazed how easy it is to get decent results. Hmm ... did I ever say Nikon seem to know a bit or two about their cameras?<br/><br/>Dylan again? Sure.

Hear it on his much-maligned 1970 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Portrait-Bob-Dylan/dp/B0000024W3" target="_blank">Self Portrait</a>".
