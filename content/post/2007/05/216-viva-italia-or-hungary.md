It was late when I began and it took me four different flowers until I came up with anything halfway decent. This is not a particularly ingenious composition or so, but I feel lighting is quite OK, so all tribute to Nikon. The flash system is really top notch.<br/><br/>This daisy looks a little bit like an Italian flag or maybe a Hungarian, depends on how you look at it. The background was originally a dark pale green, but I have overlayed a slightly blurred version of some grass that I have shot last fall.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is from one of Italy's most favorite cantautori, Francesco De Gregori. It's "<a href="http://www.lyricsandsongs.com/song/550909.html" target="_blank">Viva l'Italia</a>", originally from the 1979 album of the same title. I have it on the 1994 live album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bootleg-Francesco-Gregori/dp/B000025RWX" target="_blank">BOOTLEG</a>". Unfortunately I could not find a sound sample from that, so I'll have to direct you to the greatly different <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Viva-LItalia-Francesco-Gregori/dp/B00000GB8G" target="_blank">1979 version</a>.
