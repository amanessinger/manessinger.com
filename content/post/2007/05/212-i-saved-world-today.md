You have to know, that at the moment I have no external flash guns, much less a specialized macro flash kit. When I tried the same shot yesterday, I waited for a windless moment, grabbed macro and tripod, put everything in place and ... saw the iris softly sway in a calm breeze.<br/><br/>I still couldn't do the closeup shot that I wanted, but I could stabilize the flower as much as being able to shoot this image, without having to cut it and make the shot inside the house. I saved a flower with two needles and a clothes-peg. What an achievement ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The essence of the story is, I need flashes. Lots of flashes, but the most important thing will be the macro kit. We'll see.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricshornet.com/632214/Eurithmics-I-Saved-The-World-Today-Lyrics" target="_blank">I Saved the World Today</a>" from the Eurythmics' 1990 revival album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peace-Eurythmics/dp/B00001T3GA" target="_blank">Peace</a>". Hmm ... I love Annie Lennox' voice and would have given quite something and then more to hear her sing live on Trafalgar Square on New Year's Day 2000. Unfortunately I only found out about the concert when I saw part of it on TV. At least that's what I remember. On the Internet I can't find any trace of that concert. Did I have a "Sweet Dream"?
