<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070528_154118.JPG"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070528_154118.JPG"/></a><br/><br/>This image is from Monday in Carinthia. It was a rather drab day,  still, I was swimming in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Klagenfurt,+Austria&ie=UTF8&ll=46.5814,14.147301&spn=0.04808,0.085058&z=14&om=1" target="_blank">Keutschacher See</a>, a small lake where we have a parcel. There were these yellow flowers (again I have no idea how they are called - can anybody help me out?) and as I had the Nikon 50/1.8 mounted, I thought I would go for shallow depth-of-field. This is the unaltered JPEG right out of the camera. Ted, you complained that the Sunday flower was too sharp, well, hope this is more after your taste ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Smugmug, where I have my galleries, has something they call "communities", and my Image of the Day gallery is part of the "<a href="http://www.smugmug.com/community/DailyPhotos" target="_blank">Daily Photos</a>" community. This is a lively community of people who post one image per day, and people there regularly comment and rate. It's a funny thing: for whatever reason, within a day this image became my most popular image on Smugmug.<br/><br/>For me these flowers look a little like stars, and thus the Song of the Day is Kurt Weil's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/martin+l.+gore/lost+in+the+stars_20089658.html" target="_blank">Lost in the Stars</a>" in the fabulous version of Dee Dee Bridgewater from her 2002 Kurt Weil album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/This-New-Dee-Bridgewater/dp/B00005UW00" target="_blank">This Is New</a>".
