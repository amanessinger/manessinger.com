I had no image at 11pm, thus I went into the garden, grabbed me a columbine (at least I think it is one), mounted it in an impromptu arrangement of paper clips on the kitchen table, took camera, tripod, Sigma 150/2.8 macro and two torch lights. I made two exposures with slightly different focus. This is a combination of the two, the pistil coming from the one with nearer focus.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Prince's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/prince/purple+rain_20111285.html" target="_blank">Purple Rain</a>". Funnily enough I don't have the original in my collection, and the only version that I have already converted to OGG and therefore have at hand is the one by Bob Belden and Holly Cole. I have it on a Jazz sampler called "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Playboy-pr√§s-Cover-performed-vocalists/dp/B00008PCA2" target="_blank">The Cover Art of Blue Note</a>". It is not available in the US, at least not under this title, so I'll have to direct you to Amazon.de for a sound sample. Hmm ... as I hear it: they must have selected the most uninteresting sample from the whole track ‚òπÔ∏è<br/><br/>OK, I  just did some research and I found out that the track <span style="font-style:italic;">is available</span> in the US, but only on Bob Belden's 1993 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Doves-Cry-Music-Prince/dp/B000008UC0" target="_blank">When the Doves Cry: The Music of Prince</a>". A majority of one reviewer found the album "just never seems to get off the ground", but I promise you, this is not the case with this track üôÇ
