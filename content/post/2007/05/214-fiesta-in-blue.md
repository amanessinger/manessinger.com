Must be something like Thai, but I am not at all sure. Any idea? Even what it means?<br/><br/>From yesterday evening I still had the Sigma 30/1.4 mounted, and that's what I used, albeit at f8.<br/><br/>On her album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-Look-Natalie-Cole/dp/B000002HCV" target="_blank">Take a Look</a>" Natalie Cole sings a version of the Count Basie standard "<a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/tinpan/newbonham/6/fiestainblue.htm" target="_blank">Fiesta in Blue</a>" that basically is identical to the Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross version on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sing-Song-Basie-Hendricks-Lambert/dp/B000058A17" target="_blank">Sing a Song of Basie</a>", she even sings Jon Hendricks' lyrics. I mean, she is good. The whole album is good, but you'd better not compare it to the original by LH&amp;R. On the other hand: even Manhattan Transfer pale against them, so why shouldn't Natalie?
