<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070524_075738_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070524_075738_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>I shot this image on Thursday morning, not very far from Wednesday's, in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Vienna,+Wien,+Vienna,+Austria&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=65.645551,108.457031&ie=UTF8&cd=1&ll=48.206429,16.342871&spn=0.006893,0.013239&z=17&om=1" target="_blank">Schottenfeldgasse</a>. I saw the carrier of this bicycle display its bright colors and, still with the Sigma 30/1.4, tried to concentrate on colors and oblique lines only. I used f1.4 from very near, thereby effectively throwing almost everything out of focus.<br/><br/>How many colors has a bicycle? It's another one of these questions, like "How many roads must a man walk down" or "How long has this been going on" or maybe "How Come My Dog Don't Bark (When You Come Around)?" which is incidentally the Song of the Day. It's from Dr. John's 1992 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goin-Back-New-Orleans-John/dp/B000002LTW" target="_blank">Goin' Back to New Orleans</a>", maybe my favorite in the long list of his albums, not the least for its first song, "Litanie Des Saints", and how in a spell of genius it is followed by "Careless Love". No lyrics, sorry.
