Yesterday I drove to Villach to buy a game. Well, I've rediscovered my interest in games, at least in buying them. I like fantasy role playing games and some time ago I have bought "Gothic 3" and a graphics card capable of running it. It was pathetic. "Gothic 1" was easily the best game I have ever played, "Morrowind" and "Oblivion" included, "Gothic 2" was mostly excellent but in one area it was obvious that it had been rushed, and "Gothic 3" is abysmal from the beginning. Btw, if you're interested in "Gothic 1", please keep in mind that it's a German game. Beware of the English version. The game's success came as a surprise and translation into other languages was an afterthought. On the other hand, can it be worse than the translation of "Morrowind" or "Oblivion" into German? I don't think so ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I could have bought "Two Worlds", the most recent kid on the block that seems to have had an excellent start (meaning not so many bugs as to render it unplayable), but my fast card is in Vienna and I guess it wont be fun on a 6800GT. Thus I bought "Dungeon Siege II", together in a box with its expansion pack for 19.90 Euro. I'll try it today after having finished this and the next blog entry ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Where was I? Oh yes, Villach. When returning I came by this place and it was raining, but from the west the sun had come out and cast a strong warm light on the scenery. I stopped on the roadside, grabbed an umbrella from the rear trunk and shot five images with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and f11.<br/><br/>We already had Tom Waits' monumental 3-disc opus "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Orphans-Fold-out-Digipak-24-page-booklet/dp/B000L43AN4" target="_blank">Orphans - Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards</a>" and again it gives us the Song of the Day: "<a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/lyrics/tom_waits_lyrics_2575/orphans__brawlers_lyrics_33791/rains_on_me_lyrics_365718.html" target="_blank">Rains On Me</a>".
