I took it yesterday evening, when after a rainy day suddenly the sun came out and I stood in the garden, looking over our fence down the hill. <br/><br/>I did the usual things with this image and still was unsatisfied, but I decided that it would have to do. After having it uploaded to Smugmug this morning, I found out what had nagged me. The image had a tilted horizon. You know I normally have no problem at all with tilted horizons, but in this case it had no purpose. I simply looked wrong.<br/><br/>I loaded the PSD file again, did a "Select all/Copy merged/Paste" and with the "Lens Correction" filter I rotated the image to get the mountains level, and at the same time I scaled the image up by 110% to make it again fit into the borders.<br/><br/>I didn't like it either. It had lost too much of the fence. While switching the rotated layer on and off, I suddenly had the desperate idea to use a mask and try to combine the two images. This worked so well that I ended up with an image where only the mountains are from the rotated layer. <br/><br/>What's so funny you ask? Well, funny is that, although I exactly know what I did, I can't tell from the result where the seams are. Not in this resolution anyway, but not even in 100%. It's perfect. I never would have thought such a thing possible and if anybody would have asked me if it could work, I would have answered "probably, but  it would be so much work that it's hardly worth the hassle". It took me two minutes. Amazing.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/billie+holiday/come+rain+or+come+shine_20018040.html" target="_blank">Come Rain or Come Shine</a>" in the incredibly relaxed version that B.B.
