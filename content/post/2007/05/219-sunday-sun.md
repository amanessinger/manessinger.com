I really have to make this short ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I had a lazy Sunday, did some business type portraits of Michael who has recently graduated from university and now looks for a job.<br/><br/>For the Image of the Day I took some of the usual very-low-very-near shots with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm. Would love to know what the neighbors thought ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Beck's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beck/sunday+sun_20015368.html" target="_blank">Sunday Sun</a>" from his 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sea-Change-Beck/dp/B00006F7S4" target="_blank">Sea Change</a>" is the Song of the Day.
