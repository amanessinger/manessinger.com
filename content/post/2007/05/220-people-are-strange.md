Well, it's time ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It suddenly has got hot again and now it's swimming time again in Vienna. Yesterday I've been swimming for the second time, and when returning, I saw this image in one of those underground stations off the heart of the city, that are in fact not under ground at all. Late sunlight playing on a tangible pattern made for the blind, a stranger passing by.<br/><br/>Nikon 50/1.8 at f4 and ISO 110.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/doors/people+are+strange_20042733.html" target="_blank">People Are Strange</a>" is the Song of the Day and it's from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Days-Doors/dp/B000002I27" target="_blank">Strange Days</a>", the 1967 second album of the Doors. <br/><br/>Funny. For me "The Doors" are in the same category as the "Talking Heads", the same category in which most performers are not: TIMELESS ...<br/><br/>Believe me, this is not the last time, we'll come back.
