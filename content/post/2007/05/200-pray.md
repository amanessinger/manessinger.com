PRAY!<br/><br/>This is the Image of the Day #200. Quite some time, aye? If you have followed me through these months, you will know that I post-process almost all of my images and so I did with this. Well, probably a little more ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This morning I mounted the Sigma 150/2.8 and did some macro shots with dandelions. From the outset this one looked positively dangerous, so I thought I'd help it along a bit in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Pray!" from Apocalyptica's 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cult-Apocalyptica/dp/B00005R8CI" target="_blank">Cult</a>".
