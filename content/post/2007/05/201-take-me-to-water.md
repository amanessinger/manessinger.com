I left work at 5pm, at this time of the year a wonderful time for shooting. The light gets softer, but there are still two good hours left; outside of town it would be three. I found this fountain at the beginning of Mariahilfer Stra√üe, where the stairs go down to <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.201967,16.361432&spn=0.005878,0.014098&z=17&om=1" target="_blank">Rahlgasse</a>.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Nina Simone's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/nina+simone/take+me+to+the+water_20317844.html" target="_blank">Take Me To The Water</a>". I have it on disc 4 of the four CD box "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Women-Simone-Philips-Recordings/dp/samples/B00006ZU6B/ref=dp_tracks_all_4" target="_blank">Four Women: Nina Simone Philips Recordings</a>". A highly recommended box.
