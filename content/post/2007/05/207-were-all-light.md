I shot the image this morning in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.197261,16.347635&spn=0.011757,0.021265&z=16&om=1" target="_blank">Mariahilfer Straße</a>. It is not the first time that I tackle this shadow, but it's the first time that I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>For me this image is all about light and also about light is the Song of the Day. I never heard XTC when they were popular, but I have salvaged that some years ago. Enjoy "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/x/xtc/were+all+light_20147967.html" target="_blank">We're All Light</a>" on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wasp-Star-Apple-Venus-2/dp/B00004SWHU" target="_blank">Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2)</a>".<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, five days ago when the stars were falling, I wondered where these bizarre reflections came from. Well, I was there again today, I looked, I tried to find out, but to no avail. <span style="font-style:italic;">Maybe it is Microsoft?</span>
