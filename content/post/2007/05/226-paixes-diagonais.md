It's so ... repeatable. You can experiment with flashes, flash modes, additional light sources, compositions, and you have all the time in the world to get it right.<br/><br/>In this case I used the two flashes of my R2D2, a bluish white LED light and slow flash mode for keeping the background from getting black. After the fact I made some adjustments to white balance in Camera RAW towards blue/green. The first helped the background, the second kept detail in the red petals. Slightly cropping from both sides finally helped satisfying my diagonal passions ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>"PaixÃµes diagonais" from MÃ­sia's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Paixoes-Diagonais-Misia/dp/B00002MZ4A" target="_blank">1999 album</a> of the same name is the Song of the Day.
