Old Danube is already warm enough, weather was hot and Vienna's most famous public bath, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.228775,16.430504&spn=0.01175,0.028195&z=16&om=1" target="_blank">GÃ¤nsehÃ¤ufel</a>, in its 100<sup>th</sup> year, was definitely the place to be. I really like it there. It has the charm of the 1950s, and it is so big, that it never feels overly crowded.

I had no time at all and somehow I seem to have used it well. This is right out of the camera, a grabshot really, but I immediately fell in love with it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Sigma 30/1.4 at f1.4, 1/60s and ISO 360, D200 on ISO automatic.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.actionext.com/names_a/aretha_franklin_lyrics/night_time_is_the_right_time.html" target="_blank">Night Time Is The Right Time</a>" from Aretha Franklin's 1968 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aretha-Now-Franklin/dp/B00000331L" target="_blank">Aretha Now</a>" is the Song of the Day.
