I shouldn't do that, it makes blogging a stressful job. Anyway, you'll see four entries today, at least I hope so ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image is from Thursday morning. I couldn't decide which way to go to work and after some zig-zagging I ended up with the underground. Choosing your way in the morning is hard business, you know? You have to consider the time, if you're in a hurry or not, possible photo opportunities and, last not least, the complicated situation with bakeries. <br/><br/>My favorite baker, "<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=108716966416095170910.0000011260665eadb183b" target="_blank">VollkornbÃ¤ckerei Kornradl</a>", a real artisan of wholemeal bakery, has all that I desire in the morning, but only when I come shortly before 9am. When I'm earlier on my way, the chain "<a href="http://www.biovollwert-gradwohl.at/" target="_blank">Gradwohl</a>" is the next best thing. They exclusively have wholemeal products too, though a little more refined, less rustic. I have three shops within my reach, one of them in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Vienna,+Austria&ie=UTF8&ll=48.197025,16.345425&spn=0.006944,0.013239&z=17&iwloc=addr&om=1" target="_blank">Zieglergasse</a> near an entrance to the underground, that's the one I chose Thursday. About opposite of Gradwohl I saw this window on the top floor of a building, and there was that impossible reflection of I don't know what.<br/><br/>Hmm ... now that I look at it, could this be the <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/hardware/?WT.svl=nav" target="_blank">Xbox</a> logo? And for what sinister purpose would Microsoft do that?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/billie+holiday/stars+fell+on+alabama_20017846.html" target="_blank">Stars Fell On Alabama</a>". Out of my collection I'd recommend Anita O'Day on her 1956 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pick-Yourself-Up-Anita-ODay/dp/B0000046OM" target="_blank">Pick Yourself Up with Anita O'Day</a>", but I guess I shouldn't hold back this link I've found while searching for the lyrics: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVObfmOSNGg" target="_blank">Jack Teagarden sings "Stars Fell On Alabama"</a>. I always liked Jack Teagarden, but I've never heard him sing ðŸ™‚
