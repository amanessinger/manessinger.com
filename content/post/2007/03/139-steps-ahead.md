This is the stairwell at my home in Vienna. Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and f8, some insanely high ISO, Noise Ninja, blurring and blending and what do I know.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the one that gave me the title, it's "Steps Ahead" from De-Phazz's album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Godsdog-Phazz/dp/B00008WI8F" target="_blank">Godsdog</a>", a nervous piece that perfectly fits my hurry ðŸ™‚
