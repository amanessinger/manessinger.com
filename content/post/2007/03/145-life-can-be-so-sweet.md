Hear for yourself on her album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/At-Last-Cyndi-Lauper/dp/B0000DG06E" target="_blank">At Last</a>".<br/><br/>It shot this image at noon in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=neustiftgasse&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=48.205606,16.355038&spn=0.00695,0.013239&om=1" target="_blank">Neustiftgasse</a>, using the Nikon 18-200 VR at 18mm. This must suffice for now. It's past 4am and I ought to sleep now ðŸ™‚
