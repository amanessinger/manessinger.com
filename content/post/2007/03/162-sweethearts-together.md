I've seen them in conjunction with this old portrait of people who were in love eighty or ninety years ago and are long dead, but it never occurred to me that these are hearts, a circle of hearts.<br/><br/>Do we die? Does love die? The Song of the Day, in celebration of an old love, is "<a href="http://www.asklyrics.com/display/The_Rolling_Stones/SWEETHEARTS_TOGETHER_Lyrics/302210.htm" target="_blank">Sweethearts Together</a>" from one of the best albums the Rolling Stones have ever made, the fabulous "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Voodoo-Lounge-Rolling-Stones/dp/B000000W6L" target="_blank">Voodoo Lounge</a>".<br/><br/>Well, now having my duty fulfilled, I guess it's time to go back to bed. Have a nice day ðŸ™‚
