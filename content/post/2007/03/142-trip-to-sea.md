When I woke up and looked out of the window, I saw the moon setting in a way I can't remember having seen in Austria before. It was so incredibly clear that the moon seemed almost tangible. <br/><br/>We took the road via Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital, and soon it was clear that we would not be the only ones. It seemed like whole Slovenia was on its way to the sea. Accordingly full were the Slovenian ports <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=koper&sll=48.220001,16.37&sspn=0.111171,0.21183&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=13&ll=45.541104,13.727245&spn=0.116865,0.268135&t=k&om=1&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Koper</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=izola&layer=&sll=45.541104,13.727245&sspn=0.116865,0.268135&ie=UTF8&z=13&ll=45.536295,13.666477&spn=0.116875,0.268135&t=k&om=1&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Izola</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=portoroz&layer=&sll=45.536295,13.666477&sspn=0.116875,0.268135&ie=UTF8&z=13&ll=45.501534,13.577385&spn=0.116947,0.268135&t=k&om=1" target="_blank">Portoro≈æ</a>. We decided to try our luck in Croatia, and really, it did help. Obviously the Slovenians headed for Slovenian ports only, and as soon as we had crossed the border, it got conveniently sleepy, just as we would have expected it so early in the year.<br/><br/>It was a hot day. We had already opened the top of the car in Austria, and in the early afternoon it must have had 20 degrees Celsius at least, and some more on the balcony where later we ate. I wanted to have access to the sea, but not in one of the big tourist centers. We finally settled with <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=savudrija&layer=&sll=45.501534,13.577385&sspn=0.233894,0.42366&ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=45.499805,13.506854&spn=0.007309,0.016758&t=k&om=1&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Savudrija</a>, a small village with a port, two restaurants and some houses.<br/><br/>I have made a lot of images there, some in the early afternoon, some around and during sundown. This particular image was shot with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm. More will follow in the next days.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Goodbye Sunshine" from Chastity Bono's 1993 album "<a href="http://www.deaddisc.com/disc/Hang_Out_Your_Poetry.htm" target="_blank">Hang Out Your Poetry</a>", a jewel that unfortunately never has been followed up. The album under the band name "Ceremony" (not the heavy metal band) was graced by the likes of Jerry Garcia and Jim Keltner. Not shabby. Like so many albums it is not available any more. Get it from Amazon marketplace or Ebay.
