I am still sick at home and from my window I see snow and fog. Oh well.<br/><br/>You probably remember this image. I had also posted it on the Radiant Vista Forums, where it was generally liked, even though there were mergers with boats behind the chair. On a day like that, incapacitated like that, I thought, heck, why don't go back and fix it.<br/><br/>It was not particularly hard to do but tedious, and after having spent so much time with it, I decided to make it the Image of the Day. Bear with me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Tom Verlaine supplies a very fitting the Song of the Day. It's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/tom+verlaine/one+time+at+sundown_20285545.html" target="_blank">One Time At Sundown</a>" from his wonderful 1987 album (hey, 20 years!)
