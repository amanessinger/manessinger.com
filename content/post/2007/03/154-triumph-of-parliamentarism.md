Art was yesterday, today's boring holiday shots ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>No, honestly, I have nothing more for today than a pompous title. This is the roof of Austria's parliament, and in the background you see Burgtheater, one of the most important theaters of the German-speaking world. I took the shot from the roof terrace of the newly renovated "Palace of Justice". There's a restaurant and quite a view.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricality.com/lyrics/e63d559/" target="_blank">In the Heart of the City</a>" by Willy DeVille from his 1985 Mink DeVille album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sportin-Life-Mink-DeVille/dp/B0002VGU1U" target="_blank">Sportin' Life</a>" (for a sound sample see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spanish-Stroll-1977-1987-Mink-DeVille/dp/B000003IWR" target="_blank">here</a>). What a cover image that is!
