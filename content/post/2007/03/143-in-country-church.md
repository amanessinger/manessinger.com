I'm back to Vienna and have spent hours preparing images and yesterday's entry. Let's keep it brief now.<br/><br/>This is the parish church of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=rosegg&sll=48.220001,16.37&sspn=0.111171,0.21183&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Rosegg</a> in Carinthia. Light was mediocre today and, as I had to catch a train, I had no time to wait for sunset, thus I decided to make an interior shot.

I guess he's not everyone's taste, but when I was a teenager, he was very popular, and out of sentiment I seem to have most of his records ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.tsrocks.com/c/chris_de_burgh_texts/in_a_country_churchyard.html" target="_blank">In A Country Churchyard</a>" from his album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/End-Perfect-Day-Chris-Burgh/dp/B000026GZ3" target="_blank">At The End Of A Perfect Day</a>" is the Song of the Day.
