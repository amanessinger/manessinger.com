Sorry, I have spent rather unpleasant 24 hours now with the flu, and neither taking pictures nor writing was my top priority :/<br/><br/>This image is from Wednesday morning. Before going to work I strolled around a bit in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=16&ll=48.197361,16.341133&spn=0.012773,0.016136" target="_blank">Kaiserstra√üe</a> where I live. I took the image from inside the gateway to a house's parking area. Basically, what you see is the upper side walls, the ceiling and a window above the door. The interesting thing is, that the original was almost monochrome, but using the Lab technique usually called "Man from Mars", I have amplified the colors to where they are now, and of course I have made lots of local contrast adjustments.<br/><br/>This Wednesday morning I had quite a hangover from the night before, thus the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/i/ianduryandtheblockheadslyrics/iwanttobestraightlyrics.html" target="_blank">I Want To Be Straight</a>" from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Drugs-Rock-Roll-Blockheads/dp/B0000032DA" target="_blank">Ian Dury And The Blockheads</a>".
