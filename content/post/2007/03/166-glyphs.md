What do they mean? Do they mean the same all day? Probably they mean nothing at all most of the day for most of the people. Maybe they were painted only for these ten, 15 minutes of late sunlight, to be seen by the few who know how to read them, and maybe they suddenly get meaning as these last rays of sunlight make them burn?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://lyrics.doheth.co.uk/songs/hazel-oconnor/breaking-glass/writing-on-the-wall.php" target="_blank">Writing On The Wall</a>" from the 1980 soundtrack of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Glass-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000006ULH" target="_blank">Breaking Glass</a>". Goodness, I love <a href="http://www.hazeloconnor.com/" target="_blank">Hazel O'Connor</a>, and not only for this album, but this is how it all began.
