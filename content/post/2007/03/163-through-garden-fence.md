You shoot from out of your living room window. So I did this morning, just before I called the cab that would bring me to the railway station. I'm not completely well, but well enough for lying four and a half hours in a train to Carinthia. Hmm ... weather-wise I could have stayed in Vienna, I guess, because here in Carinthia still lies the snow from last Monday, although it continuously melts in the drizzle outside.<br/><br/>There is nothing special about this image. It is the image of the day because it is the only image of the day. That's it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Certainly post-processing was a bit different this time. I started with Nikon Capture NX and tweaked the parameters that I could have changed in-camera. It's amazing what you can do there. Then I exported the file as TIFF, did some selective color adjustments, some saturation adjustments for reds and yellows, all still in RGB (yes, Ted, it's you ðŸ™‚ before I changed to my normal working mode, to Lab, where I finally applied a slight "Man from Mars" to the lawn, to get a tad more color differentiation.<br/><br/>Actually, if I think about it, I did all my contrast work and even the sharpening in Capture NX, mostly by tweaking the in-camera parameters, and even the colors were not so far from the final result. Seems like Nikon knows a thing or two about their cameras ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day? "<a href="http://www.procolharum.com/w/w0102.htm" target="_blank">She Wandered Through The Garden Fence</a>" from Procol Harum's 1967 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Procol-Harum/dp/B000009B6E" target="_blank">Procol Harum</a>". If you think the price for this remastered extra-track version is obscene, then you could as well get what I have, a 1972 re-release under the name of their greatest hit, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whiter-Shade-Pale-Procol-Harum/dp/B00000013S" target="_blank">A&nbsp;Whiter Shade of Pale</a>", which originally was released as single only, but was included on all later re-releases.
