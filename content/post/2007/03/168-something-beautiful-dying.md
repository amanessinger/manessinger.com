<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070330_105109_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070330_105109_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>There is a yearly photo contest in Vienna, I think it's called the Vienna Photo Marathon. Don't ask. I'll probably attend, because it sounds like fun. You have a series of given topics, and within a day you have to take an image for each topic. The reason I mention it is, that they have a rule that says any form of post-processing is forbidden. Silly? Yes.<br/><br/>This is one of those images that would be forbidden under that rule. I saw these flowers on the ground when at noon I was out to take some pictures. I was already returning to work, thus I took no more than one image. Later, at home in Carinthia, when I waded through the images of today, I had some very promising candidates, but somehow these flowers wanted me to take them on, and so I did.<br/><br/>This image is probably a little bit more artificial than usual, and I can't even say that it ended up as I had wanted. Actually I have the strong feeling, that the image made me twist and bend it the way it wanted, rather than that I would have been in control. Anyway, here it is, a common effort of some dead flowers and me, evoking the kind of mourning that we always feel when something beautiful is dying.<br/><br/>This is also the Song of the Day, "Something Beautiful Dying", again from Willy DeVille's 1985 Mink DeVille album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sportin-Life-Mink-DeVille/dp/B0002VGU1U" target="_blank">Sportin' Life</a>". Sorry, I have no lyrics and regrettably not even a sound sample. Trust me, it's good for your soul.
