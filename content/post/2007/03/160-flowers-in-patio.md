I took the image Thursday morning, using the Sigma 150/2.8 macro at f4, 1/100s and ISO 500.<br/><br/>Thursday, this was the day when the flu hit, thus the Song of the Day is "The Flu" from the 1990 Jazz album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Karen-Mantler-Her-Cat-Arnold/dp/B00000DTG6" target="_blank">Karen Mantler and Her Cat Arnold Get the Flu</a>".
