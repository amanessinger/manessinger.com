These are:<br/><br/><span style="font-weight:bold;">Recitative (Alto)</span>  - "Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory." (<span style="font-style:italic;">I&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15&nbsp;:&nbsp;54</span>)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight:bold;">Duet (Alto/Tenor)</span> - "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law." (<span style="font-style:italic;">I&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15&nbsp;:&nbsp;55-56</span>)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight:bold;">Chorus</span> - "But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">I&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15&nbsp;:&nbsp;57</span>)<br/><br/>There are so many recordings of "The Messiah", I have 14 and that's far from comprehensive, so what shall I recommend? Personally, I like the interpretations of William Christie, John Eliot Gardiner, Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Trevor Pinnock best and, though you could fail with none of them, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handel-Messiah-Tomlinson-English-Concert/dp/B0000057DB" target="_blank">Trevor Pinnock</a>'s is probably the most consistent.<br/><br/>This is a tombstone in the western wall of Klagenfurt's parish church of Saint Egidius. I took the image with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and f8. I have rotated and cropped the image quite a lot, because originally I had another idea for the composition. Sometimes it's fine to have enough reserves.
