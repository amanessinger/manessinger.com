I had no idea for this image's title other than "Artificial Flowers", and when searching for a Song of the Day matching this rather dull title, I was utterly surprised to find the beautifully sad ballad "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beautiful+south/artificial+flowers_20015230.html" target="_blank">Artificial Flowers</a>" from the Beautiful South's 1997 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Colour-Beautiful-South/dp/B000001YOY" target="_blank">Blue is the Color</a>".<br/><br/>This is two days late, it's Friday's post. I was so tired, it seems I have slept most of this weekend.<br/><br/>I shot this Friday evening, while waiting in a cafÃ©. Nikon 50/1.2 at f1.2 and ISO 1600. It was very dark ðŸ™‚
