I positioned myself so that the sun was exactly behind the trunk and took this shot. Nikon 18-200 VR at 27mm and f13. f13? Goodness, I didn't reset it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It's interesting weather. We expect snow for tomorrow. At least the meteorologists do. I for myself can't imagine how sunny, warm Spring should turn to icy, cold Winter in one night. Well, OK, I've just looked at an animated satellite image, and now I begin to see how this could come to pass. Scary. I hope the snow does not destroy too much, as the trees are already blossoming and sprouting early leaves.<br/><br/>Do you love buying hardware? I do, and on Saturday I have bought 2 new hard drives. 500GB each, one for Carinthia, one for Vienna. This should take care of the space problems for another year or some more. Originally I had the intention to wait for Hitachi's terabyte drives. They were announced in December, but are still not available. Anyway, 500GB are the best bang for the buck at the moment and the capacity should suffice for a while, so I'm satisfied.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Rain and Snow" by the Chieftains from their album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Down-Old-Plank-Road-Nashville/dp/B00006AG7G" target="_blank">Down the Old Plank Road: The Nashville Sessions</a>". I've not been able to find the lyrics, but they're simple enough anyway.
