In fact, we already had this bike in "<a href="/2006/11/41-better-to-burn-out.html" target="_blank">41 - Better to Burn Out</a>". It is one of those things I pass by almost every day, one of those things I photograph over and again. Did I ever say I like old things?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day (I know, I forgot it yesterday, sorry) is "Rusty Dusty Blues" from Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross' 1958 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sing-Along-Basie-Lambert/dp/B000075AWO" target="_blank">Sing Along with Basie</a>". I've got no lyrics, Amazon has no sound samples, but trust me, there are other kinds of vocal jazz, better there ain't. They are the original inventors of "vocalese", the style once again made popular by the Manhattan Transfer and their LH&amp;R tribute album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vocalese-Manhattan-Transfer/dp/B000002II2" target="_blank">Vocalese</a>".
