The decimal system takes its toll, we have arrived at another semi-round number ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Photographically this was quite a good day. I've uploaded seven images to Smugmug, all of them at least approaching what I expect of an Image of the Day. I finally settled with this one, I can't even tell what exactly makes its appeal to me. It is something with this business guy, all self-conscious, controlled, acting cool, and at the same time oblivious to being mocked by his ridiculous shadow.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is from Robbie Williams's masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swing-Youre-Winning-Robbie-Williams/dp/B00005RFVL" target="_blank">Swing When You're Winning</a>", it's called "<a href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/18/robbie_williams/me_and_my_shadow.html" target="_blank">Me and My Shadow</a>". No wonder he has a crisis. What more can you expect from life than being hailed in Royal Albert Hall?
