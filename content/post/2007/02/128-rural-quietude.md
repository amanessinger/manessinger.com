<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070218_155524_nx.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070218_155524_nx.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This is not far from where I live, at least on weekends. Probably one kilometer. I love the quietude and serenity in this image. It's like all the work is done and the world holds its breath for a moment of quiet bliss.<br/><br/>I took the image at mid-afternoon, when I started out for a session that would have lasted till sundown, which in the meantime is again at 17:30. I shot it with the Nikon 18-200 at 50mm and f11. Many of the other images are unfortunately unusable, because two lens changes later I managed to get such a big speck of dust on the sensor, that even cloning in Photoshop would have been too tedious. When I cleaned the sensor after having arrived in Vienna, I saw that the thing was almost 2mm long. Hmm, this was not dust, this was a pebble ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I found no proper Story of the Day. In fact, I did find stories, but, can we have one day without slaughter?<br/><br/>What I have is a Song of the Day, "Air" by "The Incredible String Band", from their 1968 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wee-Huge-Incredible-String-Band/dp/B00006BC50" target="_blank">Wee Tam</a>". They certainly were no string band, but incredible they were for sure. If I would have to pick only a single one of their albums, I would have a hard time choosing between "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hangmans-Beautiful-Daughter-Incredible-String/dp/B0000263JN" target="_blank">The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter</a>" (audio samples <a href="http://www.amazon.com/5000-Spirits-Hangmans-Beautiful-Daughter/dp/B00006BC4Z" target="_blank">here</a>) and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Earthspan-Incredible-String-Band/dp/B0000011TS" target="_blank">Earthspan</a>" (also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Earthspan-Ruinous-Feud-Incredible-String/dp/B00027EFM0" target="_blank">here</a>, but no samples).<br/><br/>Have a nice week. Peace to you and your loved ones.
