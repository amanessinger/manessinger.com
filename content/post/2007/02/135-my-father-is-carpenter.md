He has always had his own small business, never more than one employee and at most two apprentices. He is a workingman and the Song of the Day, Bob Dylan's "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/moderntimes/songs/workingmansblues2.html" target="_blank">Workingman's Blues #2</a>" from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Times-Deluxe-Bonus-DVD/dp/B000GRTQSE" target="_blank">Modern Times</a>", the probably best Dylan album in 30 years, is for him. Though he probably wouldn't like it. English songs are not his style. Well, never mind.<br/><br/>There certainly is a Story of the Day, but alas not here. Sorry, it's simply too late ðŸ™‚
