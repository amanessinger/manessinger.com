"Zu den 2 Lieserln" is a typically Viennese restaurant led by two elder ladies who both happen to be called Elizabeth, or in Austrian dialect, Lieserl. In fact, I haven't seen one of them in years, so probably her health does not allow it any more. The restaurant is in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=48.204105,16.349298&spn=0.006378,0.007478" target="blank">Burggasse</a>, between Neubaugasse and Stuckgasse. If you're in for "Wiener Schnitzel" or "Cordon Bleu", this is one of a handful of places to recommend. But don't forget to order your "Kartoffel-Mayonnaisesalat".<br/><br/>The Guardian has a <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/whyiwrite/story/0,,2014835,00.html" target="blank">short interview</a> with Philip Pullman. Nothing too spectacular, but he admitted writing a sequel to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Materials-Trilogy-Golden-Compass-Spyglass/dp/0440238609/sr=8-1/qid=1171672889/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-5234988-5598269?ie=UTF8&s=books" target="blank">His Dark Materials</a>! If you like fantasy and have not read this, there is no doubt that you should. It's refreshingly different.
