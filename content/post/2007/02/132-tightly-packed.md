<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070222_164738_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070222_164738_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Yesterday's image was not exactly a tremendous success. No single comment on Smugmug in a day, I haven't had that since joining their "Daily Photos" community. The two people I have asked personally, have told me, that the image triggers no association with prison whatsoever, that it is simply a hand and a fence, altogether looking contrived. Well, that's for realizing concepts ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Today's image was shot with the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm. I have cropped it and in Lab I have applied what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photoshop-LAB-Color-Adventures-Colorspace/dp/0321356780" target="_blank">Dan Margulis</a> calls the "Man from Mars", but where that color separating layer is normally applied with anything between 5% and 10% opacity, I have used a whopping 50% here. That's where all the color comes from.<br/><br/>I had to search my collection for some time to find a Song of the Day. In the end I came up with "<a href="http://www.tsrocks.com/h/hawksley_workman_texts/tonight_romanticize_the_automobile.html" target="_blank">Tonight Romanticize The Automobile</a>" by Hawksley Workman from his album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lover-Fighter-Hawksley-Workman/dp/B0000C9ZSY" target="_blank">Lover / Fighter</a>", an absolute winner, not only for this song.<br/><br/>Now for something completely different, the Story of the Day. It is from the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/egypt/story/0,,2019064,00.html" target="_blank">Guardian</a>. A blogger in Egypt has been sentenced to four years for insulting Islam and Hosni Mubarak. Scary, ain't it? <br/><br/>From the article I know that Amnesty International runs a campaign against censorship on the Internet, and that they ask you to sign a petition and add some code to your homepage to display a quote from their database of censored statements. You see it in the sidebar. Not exactly friendly to this blog's design, but, oh well!<br/><br/>Oh, and just one more thing. Today, while strolling around after work I came by a camera shop that I had not known yet, and in their window I saw a Nikon 50/1.2. Well, what can I say? I guess you'll see some images soon.
