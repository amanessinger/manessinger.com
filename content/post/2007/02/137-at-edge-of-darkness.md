Panic rises. I don't know what it is, but it is fast, precise, unnervingly silent".<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>"Edge of Darkness" by Eric Clapton is the Song of the Day. This is part of the soundtrack to a popular 1980s BBC television drama serial. The only version I have is the one from Clapton's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/24-Nights-Eric-Clapton/dp/B000002LN9" target="_blank">24 Nights</a>" live album, though there is a dedicated soundtrack album as well. It's instrumental, thus no lyrics today ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Speaking of albums, the Guardian has the Story of the Day about heavy-metal legend "Deep Purple" asking fans <a href="http://music.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2022647,00.html" target="_blank">not to purchase</a> their latest album. Funny, aye?
