Not by anyone, no, by <a href="http://www.elite-hairstyle.com/" target="_blank">Evi Parth</a>, #1 hairdresser in Villach. Afterwards I made a short trip to Villach's Media Markt, bought two CDs, one from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leavin-Natalie-Cole/dp/B000GPIPH4/sr=1-1/qid=1170536975/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-4650390-3751047?ie=UTF8&s=music" target="_blank">Natalie Cole</a> and the latest from the fantastic singer/songwriter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Da-Questa-Parte-del-Mare/dp/B000I5YRO2/sr=1-1/qid=1170537242/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-4650390-3751047?ie=UTF8&s=music" target="_blank">Gianmaria Testa</a> from beautiful Piemont. <br/><br/>All that tired me somewhat and, although it was a wonderful day, I felt the compulsion to drive home. All in all I made only three images today, all at a place to the south of Dobratsch, near <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=14&ll=46.578215,13.634462&spn=0.052625,0.059824" target="_blank">NÃ¶tsch</a>.<br/><br/>It's no particularly good image, but I hope it's not too terribly bad either. Sorry, that's it for today. I was uninspired.
