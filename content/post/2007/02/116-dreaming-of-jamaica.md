<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070206_084019_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070206_084019_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This is not only the Image of the Day, it is actually the only image that I've made this day. Or maybe not, but to that later.<br/><br/>For me the day began with a faint dripping sound coming from outside. Rain. Not much, and I really hoped it would subside. Well, it didn't. I had to take this image of a house entrance in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&amp;z=17&ll=48.201194,16.344556&amp;spn=0.006386,0.008068" target="_blank">Zieglergasse</a> from under my umbrella. I don't know what this building is, but I had the impression of something associated with children, probably a kindergarten or a school, seemingly privately operated. It is on a route I rarely take, so I have never seen it, at least not consciously.<br/><br/>I used the Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8, and the D200's ISO automatic selected ISO 200. I have already said that multiple times, but auto ISO really is a good thing. It takes away so much of the tedium when you don't have to fiddle around yourself all of the time, and - even better - you don't have to do a thing to get back to ISO 100 when light permits. It simply does that for you. I use it almost all of the time, at least when I'm not on a tripod. The only thing I adjust is the target shutter speed. Normally I have it 1/60s, and when I mount the Nikon 18-200 VR, I set it down to 1/30s or, when shooting on the wide end, even to 1/15s. That's it.<br/><br/>I shot the image in the morning, at noon I first had not the time to go outside, and when I had, rain grew stronger. By the time I left work it was pouring.<br/><br/>As already mentioned, in a certain way this is not the only image of today. When I came home, I opened Photoshop and loaded an image of yesterday, the image of a wall on Spittelberg. The wall faces a playground and in summer it is partially covered by the leaves of a creeping plant. Actually you can see the wall on the left side of the background of "<a href="/2006/11/26-where-do-children-play.html" target="_blank">26 - Where Do the Children Play?</a>".<br/><br/>Having today's image titled as I have it, of course calls for a Jamaican Story of the Day, and here it is: <a href="http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070206/news/news1.html" target="_blank">FREAK DOG DRAWS CROWD</a> says the Jamaica Star. <br/><br/>Trash you say? Well, be thankful that I spare you "Blood Vaginas, Dismembered Women, Brutal Murders" from X-News Jamaica.
