I saw them standing side by side and could not resist. This is shot with the Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8 and ISO 1600 in low light without flash. I have corrected the strong yellow cast of the original in the signs only.<br/><br/>HELSINGIN SANOMAT has the Story of the Day. The <a href="http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Cooperation+with+Microsoft+gives+lift+to++game+developer+Remedy/1135224852775" target="_blank">cooperation with Microsoft</a> may be a big step forward for Finnish game studio <a href="http://www.remedygames.com/" target="_blank">Remedy</a>, but it is a sad sign of how Microsoft fragments the market by using games to push their hardware/software. In this case you will need Windows Vista or an Xbox 360 to play the game "Alan Wake". For technical reasons? Of course not. By the time the game comes out, the Xbox 360 will be quite obsolete compared to a then current PC, and Windows Vista is probably the most unneeded piece of software ever. It is contracts like this that only begin to create a necessity for changing to Vista.<br/><br/>Ugly Microsoft only? Nay! I remember having played a fantastic fantasy game sometime, "<a href="http://www.summoner.com/" target="_blank">Summoner</a>", a game with a good story and a rich world to explore. I really enjoyed it and was thrilled to find out that there would be a sequel. Guess what? Sony Playstation exclusive! Isn't that a fine way to alienate your customers?<br/><br/>Games only? Of course not. Think of the format war between Blue Ray and HD-DVD. The major film studios each rally behind one of these competing "standards". Goodness, how I am sick of being forced to buy a certain hardware to enjoy certain content.<br/><br/>Hell may not be finite after all.
