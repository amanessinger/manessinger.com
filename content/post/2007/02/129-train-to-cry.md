<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070219_164653_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070219_164653_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Unfortunately it's back to slaughter. The Story of the Day is, well, not a story, but a link to <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/specialcoverage/1638565.cms" target="_blank">The Times of India</a>'s coverage of the dreadful attack on the Samjhauta Express, and another one to Pakistan's <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007\02\20\story_20-2-2007_pg1_1" target="_blank">Daily Times</a>.<br/><br/>Why this one? There was a variety to choose from today. Thailand, Iraq, and I would be very surprised if that's all. What makes this strike, on the very day before the Pakistani foreign minister's scheduled visit to India, even more terrible than everything else, is that it was an attack solely undertaken to undermine peace efforts between the two states. It was not meant as retaliation for some perceived injustice, it was killing intended for one single purpose: to prolong killing.<br/><br/>This image may look like having been made to accompany the story, but in fact it was by chance. I came by this intricately shaped grate in Vienna's <a href="http://www.mqw.at/" target="_blank">MuseumsQuartier</a>, the new center of modern art. I made several exposures with the Nikon 50/1.8, some at f8, some at f1.8, one of each per framing. This is an overlay of such a pair, with all sorts of blending modes and Lab color manipulations applied.<br/><br/>Originally I had intended a psychedelic look with all colors of the rainbow, then I changed my mind for a continuation of the "<a href="/2007/02/118-bloody-dangerous.html" target="_blank">Bloody Dangerous</a>"/"<a href="/2007/02/123-bloody-romantic.html" target="_blank">Bloody Romantic</a>" series, and finally, after having read about the terror attack, I felt the need for a statement.<br/><br/>The title is of course Dylan's fantastic "<a href="http://www.lyricsandsongs.com/song/16794.html" target="_blank">It Takes A Lot To Laugh It Takes A Train To Cry</a>" from the album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Highway-61-Revisited-Bob-Dylan/dp/B00026WU82/sr=8-1/qid=1171991830/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9308389-6730253?ie=UTF8&s=music" target="_blank">Highway 61 Revisited</a>", but this is not the Song of the Day. The honor must be to Cat Steven's "<a href="http://www.allspirit.co.uk/peacetrain.html" target="_blank">Peace Train</a>". In light of the events it's text almost sounds cynical, but still, this is not the time to give up on Utopia. Less than ever.
