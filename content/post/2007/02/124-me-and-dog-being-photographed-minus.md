Well, at least today was. I felt a strong compulsion to show you images of the blossoming brush that I photographed this noon, but then, on my way home, I saw this cute guy waiting in front of a supermarket. He was neither shy nor uneasy, an ideal model, so I knelt down on the sidewalk and took some shots. <br/><br/>Funnily enough, as I stood up, a young woman approached me, asking "Can you do that again?". She wanted to take a picture of me taking a picture of the dog. I willingly complied. Unfortunately about then my phone rang. Actually I'd have been very interested in the picture <span style="font-weight:bold;">she</span> took, but in the following phone talk I lost her.<br/><br/>This was taken with the Sigma 30/1.4 wide open.<br/><br/>Sorry, no Story of the Day today.
