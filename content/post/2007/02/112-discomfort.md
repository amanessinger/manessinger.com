Well, during the whole day I had no time for shooting, and when I arrived in Carinthia, the whole snow covered valley was bathed in moonlight. The usual question "macro or night shot?" was quickly answered an favour of "night shot".<br/><br/>Goodness, is that tedious!<br/><br/>Basically the routine is: setting ISO to 3200, making a shot with 15 seconds exposure, checking on the LCD, recomposing, making another shot, checking, and so on, until I get a decent result. Then I set ISO back to 100, expose for 10 minutes, wait for noise reduction to finish, and ready I am for the next shot.<br/><br/>I did two such exposures, much to the annoyance of my family, and when I finally saw them on screen (the shots, not my family), I was annoyed as well. Certainly nothing even remotely usable for an Image of the Day!<br/><br/>I have pondered and pondered about these two images, whether to use them anyway or not, and in the end (now being Saturday night) came too the conclusion that I will stick to my wont so far, and release an image made on another day.<br/><br/>OK, so this one is not from Friday, it is from Thursday morning.<br/><br/>This is no positive image. Well, in reality its subject is innocuous enough. It shows rails of the Viennese tramway line 49 in Siebensterngasse, but in my mind those rails lead to a terrible place. <br/><br/>It is something in the way my view is restricted, not only to the front, no, to the sides as well. It is the view of those who don't dare to raise their heads for fear of reprisals, it is the view of those who are led before their slaughterer. It smells like concentration camp, like the triumph of steel over flesh, like the breakdown of humanity in the clash of ideologies. I don't like it.<br/><br/>No story for Friday.
