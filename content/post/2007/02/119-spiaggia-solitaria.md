That's good ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>What I didn't have was a title. This happens at times. Then I sit and ponder, ponder and wait, wait and nothing happens. No title comes to my mind. In such cases I look for music. Music that for me represents at least some of the qualities of the image in question. So I did this time and I came up with Alice's incredible album  "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gioielli-Rubati-Alice/dp/B0000084NZ/sr=8-1/qid=1171058320/ref=sr_1_1/103-4650390-3751047?ie=UTF8&s=music" target="_blank">Gioielli Rubati</a>", an album of songs by the great Italian singer/songwriter Franco Battiato. <br/><br/>Doesn't she look gorgeous on the cover? And her voice! If you hear nothing else, hear at least "Prospettiva Nevski" and I guarantee you, you're hooked. Amazon.com has one in stock, so hurry ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>There is a song on this album, "Summer on a solitary beach", that somehow had the quality I was looking for, so this is called "spiaggia solitaria", which means "solitary beach".<br/><br/>Oh yes, just one more thing: this is a Lensbaby shot (f2.0 as always) of a mouse pad seen through a plastic bottle of <a href="http://www.voeslauer.com/english/start.html" target="_blank">VÃ¶slauer</a> mineral water ðŸ˜‰<br/><br/>No Story of the Day. Sorry.
