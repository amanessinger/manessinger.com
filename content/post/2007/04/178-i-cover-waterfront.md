When returning from my parents, I took a small detour to Klagenfurt's shore of WÃ¶rthersee, went straight to the water and took this image of a reflection of the pier in front of the restaurant "<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&om=1&z=15&ll=46.623004,14.249911&spn=0.02632,0.032272&msa=1" target="_blank">Lido</a>". I took some more photos, but I already knew that this  was it.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/billie+holiday/i+cover+the+waterfront_20017853.html" target="_blank">I Cover the Waterfront</a>" is - surprise, surprise - the Song of the Day, a Jazz standard, and today we take Mary Coughlan's version from her <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sings-Billie-Holiday-Mary-Coughlan/dp/B00004XMWG" target="_blank">Billie Holiday tribute album</a>. A slightly different but equally good version is on her 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Honeymoon-Mary-Coughlan/dp/B00020QXPO" target="_blank">Long Honeymoon</a>". I like both, but there is nothing by her that I don't like ðŸ™‚
