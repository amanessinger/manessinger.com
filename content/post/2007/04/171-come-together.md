<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070402_151517_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070402_151517_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This was the last image I took today, and I instantly knew I had an Image of the Day. What attracted me was the lone flower, the strong red, the circles of the table and the chairs around, strong lines, the zebra pattern and the accent of color. Obviously I used the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm. <br/><br/>I did pretty much post-processing, darkening the asphalt, increasing the contrast between asphalt and chairs, resurrecting detail in the reflections of the window, pushing color heavily, etc. <br/><br/>Did it look that way? Yes, absolutely, albeit only in my imagination.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beatles/come+together_10026513.html" target="_blank">Come Together</a>" from the Beatles' 1969 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Abbey-Road-Beatles/dp/B000002UB3" target="_blank">Abbey Road</a>". Amazon has no sound samples, but I trust you don't need one ðŸ™‚
