There was a big container, forest green, and a piece of wood lying in front. It looked somehow surreal in this urban area, and that's the reason I took the image. It's again taken with the Nikon 18-200 at 18mm. I should probably have changed to the Sigma 10-20, but I was in a hurry and that's all I got.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is of course Paolo Conte's "<a href="http://www.lyricsandsongs.com/song/579196.html" target="_blank">It's a Green Dream</a>" from his album "<a href="http://www.allofmp3.com/r2/Paolo_Conte/Razmataz/group_4311/album_6/mcatalog.shtml?albref=26" target="_blank">Razmataz</a>".
