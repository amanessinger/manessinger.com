I shot the image this afternoon with the Nikon 18-200 at 27mm and f13.<br/><br/>In the evening, during dinner in a pizzeria in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Sankt+Jakob+im+Rosental&sll=46.542923,14.055634&sspn=0.105319,0.119648&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Sankt Jakob</a>, I heard the Song of the Day on the radio, "<a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2108" target="_blank">I Can See Clearly Now</a>", probably in the original version by Johnny Nash, but this is not what we're looking at today. This song has been covered many times, and the only version I have accessible quite now, is definitely not the worst: Holly Cole on her 1993 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Smoke-Holly-Cole-Trio/dp/B000005HBB" target="_blank">Don't Smoke in Bed</a>".
