<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070412_164906_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070412_164906_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Thursday, again taken on my way home, this time in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Vienna,+Austria&ie=UTF8&z=16&ll=48.198105,16.342764&spn=0.013888,0.026479&om=1" target="_blank">Stollgasse</a>, round the corner from where I live.<br/><br/>I am not sure why I have framed this photo the way I did. I have tried to crop it, "concentrate on one idea", but, against all rules as it may be, this is it. This is the perfect crop, exactly as I shot it in the first place. <br/><br/>This is a story of old love and "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/louis+armstrong/i+cant+give+you+anything+but+love_20085372.html" target="_blank">I Can't Give You Anything But Love</a>" is the Song of the Day. It's old love, so we go back to Louis Armstrong. I have a CD with recordings from 1928-29 that is no longer available, but you'll find it as track 12 on disc 1 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Essential-Louis-Armstrong/dp/samples/B0002JE8WU" target="_blank">The Essential Louis Armstrong</a>". Alas the sound sample stops before he starts singing, but you'll get the mood.
