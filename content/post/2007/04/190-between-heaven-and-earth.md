<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070421_154624_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070421_154624_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Funny. Yesterday I went into this <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=faaker+see&layer=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=66.066649,108.457031&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=46.568509,13.906631&spn=0.028648,0.052958&om=1" target="_blank">church in Faak</a> (located in "Kirchengasse", who would have thought that) to make some HDR images, and I did, but so far  I've not even try to work on them. This image clearly was my favorite. It always amazes me how incredibly easy it is to create foregrounds out of nothing. You only have to use an ultra-wide lens (this of course being my Sigma 10-20 at 14mm and f9.5) and go very, very low. At this time of the year it is especially easy with all those flowers around.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://bobdylan.com/moderntimes/songs/tryin.html" target="_blank">Tryin' To Get To Heaven</a>" from Bob Dylan's 1997 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Out-Mind-Bob-Dylan/dp/B000002C2E" target="_blank">Time Out Of Mind</a>". At least for me the sound samples on bobdylan.com don't work, but those on Amazon do, so please go there. Hmm ... we had some references to Dylan in the past and you can safely bet that there'll be more. I haven't seen the old man en vivo in quite a while though.
