Why? I was tired, I have a new graphics card (which partially explains why I was tired), and I had some stress at work. I did not fail to shoot images though, thus all you'll see posted today has been shot at the respective days.<br/><br/>This was last Wednesday, on my way from work. I took an unusual detour through the 8<sup>th</sup> district, basically all the while going toward the low sunlight. In a corner I saw this window, facing east, reflecting a distant, sunlit facade that in turn reflected some light on the graffiti.<br/><br/>Randy Crawford's "Shine" is the Song of the Day. I couldn't find any lyrics, but there is a sound sample on Amazon's page for the 1992 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Through-Eyes-Love-Randy-Crawford/dp/B000002LRB" target="_blank">Through the Eyes of Love</a>".
