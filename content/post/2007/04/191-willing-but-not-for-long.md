Normally it takes one, at most two shots and off he is.<br/><br/>"Alley Cat Song" from Holly Cole's latest album titled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Holly-Cole/dp/B000N60HDQ" target="_blank">Holly Cole</a>" is the Song of the Day and it fits the mood. No lyrics this time, and for a sound sample I have to beg you to <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Holly-Cole/dp/B000KX0GHE" target="_blank">Amazon's German site</a>.
