It didn't get better.<br/><br/>It's amazing how different these colors are from what the camera recorded. I tried to recreate in Photoshop what I had seen, I checked multiple times by going out into the garden and I am absolutely sure that I got it right: this is how it looked.<br/><br/>To me it looks like an embrace, and therefore the Song of the Day can only be "<a href="http://www.asklyrics.com/display/Billie_Holiday/Embraceable_You_Lyrics/199230.htm" target="_blank">Embraceable You</a>". By whom? Tough. Everybody has sung it, so why not some less known version like the Viennese singer Hansi Lang's from the acclaimed but outside of Austria  probably mostly unknown 2005 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/This-Slow-Club-Hansi-Lang/dp/B0009G1IK6" target="_blank">This Is the Slow Club</a>"?. <br/><br/>I have no idea if Amazon would deliver it to, say, the US, at least they don't list it on their US site. Remember, globalization is for the corporations, not for the people.
