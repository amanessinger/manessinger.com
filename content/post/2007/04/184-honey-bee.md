<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070415_171346_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070415_171346_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>The nice thing with a macro lens is, that if you've had a long day (hey, this is my fifth Image of the Day today) and don't want to go out searching for photo opportunities, you simply mount the macro, go in your garden and shoot some bees ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Have you ever tried to take images of bees? On a blossoming tree with boughs slowly (but steadily) moving in the wind? Well, if not, you're in for a treat in humility. Two out of maybe thirty shots is not exactly the ratio I am normally used to, but this is real hard. Everything moves, the blossoms, the bee, the bough, so I've set ISO Auto to a maximum shutter speed of 1/250s, the lens to f8, the camera to continuous autofocus, but this is no more than reasonable conditions for sharp pictures. Now try composing. Good luck ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>For the Song of the day we cling to the word "honey" and - I know this is somewhat contrived - come again to the fabulous Mary Coughlan and her 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Long-Honeymoon-Mary-Coughlan/dp/B0000525N2" target="_blank">Long Honeymoon</a>". Funny. Searching for the lyrics I constantly stumbled over the name Elvis Costello and, sure enough, the Song "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/elvis+costello/the+long+honeymoon_20047346.html" target="_blank">The Long Honeymoon</a>" is his! I never knew, but I shall check it out. In fact I've just ordered it. It's on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Imperial-Bedroom-Elvis-Costello/dp/B0000787FH" target="_blank">Imperial Bedroom</a>" and this is a good thing, because I couldn't get at a sound sample from Mary Coughlan's version anyway.<br/><br/>Edit: I've changed the URL for "Long Honeymoon", Amazon has sound samples now.
