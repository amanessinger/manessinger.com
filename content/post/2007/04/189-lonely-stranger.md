On my way from work to the underground I still managed to make this image of a flower blossoming in no-flower's land.<br/><br/>Later, in the train I finished "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-David-Bayles/dp/0961454733" target="_blank">Art &amp; Fear</a>", a book I had lying around for some time now, heartily recommended by <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted Byrne</a>, and later yet I began Scott McCloud's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X">Understanding Comics</a>", recommended by Ted as well. Thanks again Ted, they're brilliant, both of them.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/eric+clapton/lonely+stranger_20051566.html" target="_blank">Lonely Stranger</a>" from Eric Clapton's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unplugged-Eric-Clapton/dp/B000002MFE" target="_blank">Unplugged</a>" album.
