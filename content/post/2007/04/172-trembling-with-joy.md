It's late and I should rather go to sleep ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image is from yesterday. I was out for a noon session, it was a bright, sunny day and I used the Lensbaby for a change.<br/><br/>There's not much more to tell, only that I surprisingly had a hard time finding a Song of the Day. I admit, I have settled with the rather obvious: "<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/The-Manhattan-Transfer/Sing-Joy-Spring.html" target="_blank">Sing Joy Spring</a>" by the Manhattan Transfer from their 1985 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vocalese-Manhattan-Transfer/dp/B000002II2" target="_blank">Vocalese</a>". The lyrics are by the master of vocalese himself, Jon Hendricks of "Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross" fame.
