Being in a hurry and being creative are an odd pair.<br/><br/>I shot this image after having arrived in Velden, being on my way back home. The sun just went down and the situation reminded me of the sunrise Ted Byrne showed in a <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/04/not-done-this-before-hulp.html" target="_blank">recent post</a> to his blog. While he played on strong yellow-green, pastels and light rising, this image is about purple, orange and darkness creeping.<br/><br/>Nikon 50/1.8 at f8.<br/><br/>At the moment I'm ripping the rest of my Bob Dylan CDs, so by chance I found "<a href="http://bobdylan.com/moderntimes/songs/redsky.html" target="_blank">Under the Red Sky</a>" from Dylan's equally named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Under-Red-Sky-Bob-Dylan/dp/B0000027DR" target="_blank">1990 album</a> quite fitting ðŸ™‚
