On my way there I already saw this image, tried to take it, but I simply had not enough time. Today I tried it again, took maybe five minutes, made eight shots, and one of them was pretty much what I had had in mind. This was shot with the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm, pointing the camera up to a porch of glass, waiting for passers-by to get reflected.<br/><br/>I don't know exactly why, but for me this image has a strong connotation of "passing of time". Maybe it's the juxtaposition of the architecture and the short instant that a particular passer-by gets reflected, the static and the dynamic, the contrast between the frozen and the fleeting.<br/><br/>All this makes "<a href="http://musique.ados.fr/Souad-Massi/Passe-Le-Temps-t102816.html" target="_blank">Passe le Temps (As Time Goes By)</a>" the Song of the Day. It's from Souad Massi's 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Deb-Heartbroken-Souad-Massi/dp/B0002H4MB4" target="_blank">Deb (Heartbroken)</a>".
