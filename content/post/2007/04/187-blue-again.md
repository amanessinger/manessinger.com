I was a little bit early for the hospital and, strolling around, I found this door.<br/><br/>It was a drab day and I had to boost colors a little, but otherwise I have not cleaned up even a bit. I took the image with the Nikon 18-200 at 52mm and f6.7. <br/><br/>This is my lens of choice for most situations when I don't know what to expect from a place or when it is not likely that I return soon. The forced perspective and restricted choice of a prime are great for boosting creativity, but of course you miss things. No big deal when you simply come back, maybe with another prime, the next day, but if not, there is nothing that beats the 18-200.<br/><br/>"Blue Again" by the Manhattan Transfer is the Song of the Day. You find it on their Louis Armstrong tribute album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spirit-St-Louis-Manhattan-Transfer/dp/B00004YNGW" target="_blank">The Spirit of St. Louis</a>", a fabulous effort with solo performances of all four, this one by Tim Hauser.
