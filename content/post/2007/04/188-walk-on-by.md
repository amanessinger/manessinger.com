In <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=48.201652,16.35125&spn=0.005878,0.014098&om=1" target="_blank">Mondscheingasse</a> I saw the shadow of a bicycle leaning there, and when a guy with an orange in his hand walked by, I took this image. After he had passed I took another strictly composed shot, and one more when a woman parked a second bicycle. Needless to say that both didn't come close. The guy is in a perfect position, his shadow is in a perfect position, and, did I say I like the orange?<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cake/walk+on+by_20026683.html" target="_blank">Walk on By</a>" from Cake's 1998 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prolonging-Magic-Cake/dp/B00005ABIP" target="_blank">Prolonging the Magic</a>".
