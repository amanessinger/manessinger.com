At that time it is almost empty, all shops are still closed, save the odd cafÃ©, and one more time I had bright sun shining in my face.<br/><br/>Just around the corner from KaiserstraÃŸe there are some old, small shops, and one of them made nice reflections on the sidewalk. I positioned myself and waited until I had the reflection of a passer-by.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rod+stewart/people+get+ready_20117591.html" target="_blank">People Get Ready</a>", a song I like very much in Rod Steward's version from his "Unplugged" album, but this time we hear the Blind Boys of Alabama on their 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Higher-Ground-Blind-Boys-Alabama/dp/B00006AO77" target="_blank">Higher Ground</a>". Arguably more fitting ðŸ™‚
