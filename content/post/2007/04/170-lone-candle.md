<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070401_135922_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070401_135922_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>The weather should have been better today, but it was reckless and defied the forecast, which again called for interiors. Finding an empty church on Palm Sunday is not so easy, thus I decided to try my luck with <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Griffen,+V%C3%B6lkermarkt,+Carinthia,+Austria&layer=&ie=UTF8&sll=48.220001,16.37&sspn=0.111171,0.21183&z=15&ll=46.697081,14.702368&spn=0.02861,0.067034&om=1" target="_blank">Stift Griffen</a>, a former monastery of the Premonstratensians, about 30km east of Klagenfurt. It has two churches, a cloister, and a big graveyard within the walls. Today it houses a museum dedicated to the Carinthia author Peter Handke, who was born near Griffen. <br/><br/>This image was taken in the older, smaller church. I saw the lone candle on the floor, just in front of a small step, and I decided to go very, very low. I used the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm. Again it is an HDR image made from seven exposures at 1EV distance, tone mapped with Photomatix and then post-processed in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is not a song but an instrumental piece, "Who Will Rescue You?" from the fantastic 1996 Jazz album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carla-Bley-Band-Goes-Church/dp/B000024MF5" target="_blank">The Carla Bley Big Band Goes to Church</a>". Very recommended, just as most of her work, no, all of it that I know ðŸ™‚
