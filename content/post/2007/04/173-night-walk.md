I went home from work late, and when I passed the CafÃ© Ahorn in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=48.200207,16.347324&spn=0.006951,0.013239&om=1" target="_blank">Ahornergasse</a> (contrary to what the map says, there is a connection between Neubaugasse and Ahornergasse/Seidengasse), I saw this stack of chairs, catching the light of street lanterns. I shot this with the Nikon 50/1.2 at f1.2.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "La Nuit De Clifton Chenier" from Beausoleil's 1991 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cajun-Conja-Beausoleil/dp/B0000032G7" target="_blank">Cajun Conja</a>". Looking them up on Amazon has reminded me of how much is now available from them. Once, when I bought this CD - in the wake of the movie "The Big Easy" - it was impossible to get more than two CDs. As to be expected, there seem to be no lyrics online ðŸ™‚
