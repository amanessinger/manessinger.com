This is not the very noblest of cafés, it's not a place I would recommend blindly to everybody, but the fact that this is a dead-end street, therefore without traffic, and that it is sunny, makes it somehow special. I am not there very often, but it is nice to find yourself remembered, to be asked if you want the same as always. It adds to the warm feeling of the sun.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/2/billy_joel/streetlife_serenader.html" target="_blank">Streetlife Serenader</a>" from Billy Joel's 1974 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Streetlife-Serenade-Billy-Joel/dp/B00000DCHA" target="_blank">Streetlife Serenade</a>" is the Song of the Day.
