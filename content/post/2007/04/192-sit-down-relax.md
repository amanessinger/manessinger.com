I took the image on my way to the underground and further on to "Alte Donau", where I had dinner at a nice place by the water. I used the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm and f11.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Edoardo Bennato's "<a href="http://www.lyricsmania.com/print.php?id=56021" target="_blank">Relax</a>" from the not so easily available album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kaiwanna-Edoardo-Bennato/dp/B00005S0RC" target="_blank">Kaiwanna</a>". Amazon claims this is from 2003, but that's nonsense. 1985 it is, and what an album. Experimental, varied in style but not in quality.
