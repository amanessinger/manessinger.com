Honestly, I don't know whom he is talking to, but this guy was certainly agitated. Is his baby coming home today? Does he dye his hair yellow? And if we should never trust a man in a blue trench coat, can we trust him if he wears a parka? So many questions.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 75mm, f8 and 1/40s.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7587/frank.html" target="_blank">Telephone Call From Istanbul</a>" (scroll down for the lyrics, it's song #14) from Tom Waits' masterpiece "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Franks-Wild-Years-Tom-Waits/dp/B000001FSR" target="_blank">Franks Wild Years</a>". But it's all masterpieces, right? See him perform a different version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-t9z8OLoCg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
