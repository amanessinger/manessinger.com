You don't know what quoting hell is? Lucky you!<br/><br/>But even when you're out on the streets: at this time of the year you always feel like being at the ground of a canyon. Sure, there is sun, somewhere up there, but you are damned to march in the shades forever and ever.<br/><br/>One way to get around the problem is, to take images with a long lens and along the canyon walls, preferably when the canyon runs west to east. Just like <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.20906,16.352935&spn=0.011454,0.028195&z=16&om=1" target="_blank">JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe</a> in this image.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 VR at 200mm, f13, 1/80s.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061129_194002_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2006/20061129_194002_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> At night the Christmas decoration, these globes that by day almost look like barbed wire, glows eerily blue. Have a look at an image from last year, made in the evening, looking the other way, and using the Sigma 30/1.4 at f6.3.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071127_163744_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071127_163744_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The final image that I want to share is from this afternoon. It's a strange kind of graffiti: paper glued to a wall, and on that a stenciled motive. Seems to be the most efficient way to ruin as many walls as you can in your precious time. Still, it's cute how the gibbon runs ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is by Air and it is called "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/a/air/new+star+in+the+sky_10003589.html" target="_blank">New Star In The Sky</a>". It's from their 1998 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moon-Safari-Air/dp/B000003S5H" target="_blank">Moon Safari</a>". Hear the whole song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_-fPJzW308" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
