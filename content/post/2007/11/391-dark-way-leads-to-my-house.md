I searched my collection for the keywords "dark", "fear", "shake" and many more, and then I remembered a CD that could fit, an album mostly in German language called "Nachtmahr" (nightmare) by Meret Becker, and searching for Meret Becker on YouTube I found her incredibly beautiful "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm_aut6RDAY" target="_blank">Stella Maris</a>", a duet with Blixa Bargeld of "EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten" (and up to 2003 "The Bad Seeds"), and so I ended up ordering five "EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten" CDs via Amazon. And still no Song of the Day. Oh well!<br/><br/>Returning to my collection I finally found it: "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/annielennox/darkroad.html" target="_blank">Dark Road</a>" from Annie Lennox' new album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Mass-Destruction-Annie-Lennox/dp/B000UCEJEQ" target="_blank">Songs of Mass Destruction</a>". It seems to be the hit single on the album (I can't tell, I don't hear radio), because Amazon features the video. Alternatively you can see it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCFbKEVzlOo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. It's Annie at her best.<br/><br/>So now, what's it with this image, you ask? Oh, I say, it's not one, it's two ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>When I went home today at 7pm it was completely dark, there was a demonstration for human rights on the streets, lots of police, and it took me some time to get into a creative mood. I took some images, mostly of shop windows, graffiti, etc, all very dark, and then I came by this house entrance (some house, not mine actually). It was extremely dark and, using the Sigma 10-20 at f5.6 and ISO 1600, I ended up with shutter speeds at 3.6 seconds. I can tell you, that's not easy to hold ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I took two shots, both deliberately shaken, one more so, one less, and later in Photoshop I combined the two exposures. Interesting, how much color a camera records, even when the naked eye fails to see it any more. But that's how eyes work, and that's one reason why I love night photography.
