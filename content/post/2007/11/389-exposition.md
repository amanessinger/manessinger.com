I had tried four shots along the street, but none of them was really usable. I know I should use  continuous shooting mode in such cases, and shoot bursts instead of single images. Alas, I didn't. Of course properly I would have used a tripod, but I hate lugging tripods to and from work, and thus I had none with me. Anyway, maybe next time ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image, shot with the Nikon 18-200 at 26mm, f8 and 1/10s is critically sharp. Small wonder. That's the benefit of the short focal distances.<br/><br/>It's some decorative light on an Italian restaurant. Actually it is one of many, and in reality there is no connection between the light and the boxes, but when I saw it, I immediately thought of a deliberate arrangement. Post-processing was done in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Exposition" from Deep Purple's second album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Book-Taliesyn-Deep-Purple/dp/B00004KD0Z" target="_blank">The Book of Taliesyn</a>"
