A guy who knows what he is. Too bad he can't spell, right?<br/><br/>Well, whenever I post graffiti, Ted righteously hates it. Most of the time I am more forgiving, but this is the kind of scribbling that's beyond the line, even for me. It's a sad thing, that 90% of all graffiti are such junk.<br/><br/>And this immediately brings me to the Song of the Day. Enjoy the Sex Pistols and "<a href="http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/sexpistols/sillything.html" target="_blank">Silly Thing</a>". It is on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flogging-Dead-Horse-Sex-Pistols/dp/B0000073PP" target="_blank">Flogging a Dead Horse</a>" and "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Rock-Roll-Swindle/dp/B000025IQA" target="_blank">The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle</a>", and also on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kiss-This-Best-Sex-Pistols/dp/B0000073PQ" target="_blank">Kiss This: The Best of the Sex Pistols</a>". Hear it also on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOlA6Tl7zRs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071007_074127_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071007_074127_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> But now for something completely different. Speaking of Ted, today he posted two fantastic images of a young and well-looking photographer <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/11/florence-5-andreas-and-duomo.html" target="_blank">at work</a>, and somehow this spurned my desire to retaliate. The <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/community/showthread.php?t=5472" target="_blank">thread</a> goes on. Or is it a threat?
