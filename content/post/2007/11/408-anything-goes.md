By the time I was there it poured down and there was no chance to get any decent shots. I already played with the thought of using one  of yesterday's images, shot immediately before I made yesterday's "<a href="/2007/11/407-chance-meeting.html" target="_blank">Chance Meeting</a>". You can even see the door in the background.<br/><br/>When I eventually drove down to our favorite China restaurant, I finally found the image.

I had the Sigma 10-20 mounted, and with all the cars parking in front of the lights, it was hard to get any interesting composition. OK, I thought, then with a car. And so I did ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, f5.6, ISO 125, 1/4s, hand-held from under an umbrella.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is my all-time favorite version of Cole Porter's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cole+porter/anything+goes_20289240.html" target="_blank">Anything Goes</a>". It's from the opening scene of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Indiana-Jones-Temple-Doom-Widescreen/dp/B000F7OMZ2" target="_blank">Indiana Jones &amp; the Temple of Doom</a>", sung by Helen Hobson in Mandarin. Hilarious! Hear a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Indiana-Jones-Trilogy-Various-Artists/dp/B00007GZKR" target="_blank">sound sample</a> on Amazon.com. It's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S41DI6" target="_blank">track 8</a> you want. Track 16 is the normal English version.<br/><br/><br/>Today, when in the morning the fog lifted for some minutes and I caught a glimpse of blue sky, it almost looked like we could get a sunny day.<br/><br/>I was so wrong.
