I have lost one, more than a week ago, and it was time to renew them anyway, so I ordered a pair. Yesterday they arrived, today I went to fetch them. Normally it does not make a lot of a difference while photographing. I really feel alright using the D200 while wearing glasses, but at this time of the year I have constant trouble with the glasses filming over, so I'm glad to be back to lenses.<br/><br/>I knew that there would most likely be rain in the afternoon (wrong, but only by hours, now in the middle of the night it does rain), so I used the opportunity and took some images in Klagenfurt's historical center. This constellation of a door and a manhole cover is something that immediately caught my attention.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/roxy+music/chance+meeting_20118967.html" target="_blank">Chance Meeting</a>" from the stellar 1972 Roxy Music debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Roxy-Music/dp/B0000256KG" target="_blank">Roxy Music</a>".
