If you're not from Austria, you will most likely not know the term. It is a public water basin in the ground level corridor of an old house. The form of the handle on the faucet is a pun on the German word "Hahn", that can mean "rooster" as well as "faucet".<br/><br/>I took the image yesterday morning, here in my house, before I left for work. Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8, ISO 1250, 2500K white balance and 1/15s. Boy, that was dark! I had to push the exposure in Photoshop, because the image was slightly underexposed as well. This necessitated the use of Noise Ninja and mild doses of some other tricks, but I guess the result is quite acceptable. In fact I would happily print it in A3 format.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Where Water Flows" from Calexico's 1998 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Light-Calexico/dp/B0000064B7" target="_blank">The Black Light</a>". No need for lyrics, there ain't any ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, we had snow yesterday. I may show some in today's image.
