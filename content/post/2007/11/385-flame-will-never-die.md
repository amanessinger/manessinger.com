<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071102_105018_camera.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20071102_105018_camera.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Three images for today - I couldn't help but take this one. I shot it late in the morning, the image is right out of the camera, and these are fall colors at their best. Funnily enough, you don't see all that flaming splendor when you're far away. You have to get near, otherwise the colors mix up, blend together, and the forest is nothing but a murky, reddish brown. But when you do get near, Goodness, the trees are suddenly on fire. <br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 18mm, f8 and 1/30s. The blue sky and the polarizer may have helped a bit ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071102_091223_nx_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071102_091223_nx_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The second image is from earlier in the morning. It is the same pasture that we had two days ago in "<a href="/2007/10/383-fog-creeping.html" target="_blank">Fog Creeping</a>", this time from another viewpoint, and of course the fog is not creeping up but retreating.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071102_095612_nx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071102_095612_nx.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The third image finally is an architectural detail, a window made of glass bricks in a stairwell of an office building. The light came through the glass and made these flaming reflections. I had the camera still on daylight white balance, thus the image out of the camera was very yellow, but in post-processing I have driven the wall to neutral, which may be a bit colder than it was in reality. I like the effect though.<br/><br/>Why have I chosen the trees? Well, in all these last days in Carinthia, I have been in search of the definite image of fall colors. Now, as regards me, this is it. I can't imagine getting anything better this year.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "The Flame Will Never Die" from Beausoleil's 1987 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Boogie-Beausoleil/dp/B0000003B4" target="_blank">Bayou Boogie</a>". I love Cajun and Zydeco music, ever since I saw "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Easy-Dennis-Quaid/dp/6305262268" target="_blank">The Big Easy</a>". What a tremendous impact this movie had. Basically it put Cajun on the map, at least for us Europeans.
