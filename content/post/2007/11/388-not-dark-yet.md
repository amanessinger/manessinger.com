It lacks a happy ending". So true ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image was shot at about 5pm, a time when I frequently leave work, and though it had not been dark yet, it was getting there. Daylight saving time (we call it "summertime" around here) has ended a week ago, and from now on much of what I'll be presenting, will necessarily be dark. No, don't worry, this is no depression, no, absolutely ... almost ... not. At least not a big one. Hmph.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Bob Dylan's "<a href="http://bobdylan.com/songs/notdark.html" target="_blank">Not Dark Yet</a>" from 1997's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Out-Mind-Bob-Dylan/dp/B000002C2E" target="_blank">Time Out Of Mind</a>". See him perform it live <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4dnK5j-A7Q" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB7ezMrzI_k" target="_blank">there</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrfBRFkkRfI" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>.
