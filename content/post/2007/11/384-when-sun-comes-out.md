It was a bright day with clear blue sky, and the fog was already retreating. I rushed out, shot some images down into the valley, over the fog and to the mountains, and in the end I went to these trees, knowing that there would be fingers of light.

I have it on a CD with live tracks from sometime in the early 1960s, but the exact compilation seems to be unavailable now, though I have found the very same version on a CD of the same name, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Over-Rainbow-Judy-Garland/dp/B000002XLJ" target="_blank">Over The Rainbow</a>". It seems to be from the same masters, it only has less tracks. Anyway, "When The Sun Comes Out" and the incredibly sad, heart-tearing "Over The Rainbow" alone would be worth the price.<br/><br/>Regrettably YouTube has no version by Judy Garland, but there is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pLoKjO8QlM" target="_blank">live version</a> by Barbra Streisand, recorded during her 2006 tour, and while this may be more triumphant than sad, it is no slouch either.
