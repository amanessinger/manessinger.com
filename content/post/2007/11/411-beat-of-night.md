OK, a guy may dream, yeah?<br/><br/>Yesterday we had Christmas decoration in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.20906,16.352935&spn=0.011454,0.028195&z=16&om=1" target="_blank">JosefstÃ¤dter StraÃŸe</a> as seen in the morning, plus a nighttime view from last year, today it's another night shot.<br/><br/>What else? Oh, the Nikon D300 has come to Austria (and everywhere else). What a difference to the launch of the D200. Then it was almost impossible to get one for months, today I have seen it in two shops that I've come by, and one of them had two of it in the window. It looks good. Very good. I'm curious for how long I'll be able to resist ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Beat-Of-The-Night-lyrics-Boomtown-Rats/BA956A09FC20416E48256FEF000932B5" target="_blank">The Beat Of The Night</a>" by Bob Geldof.
