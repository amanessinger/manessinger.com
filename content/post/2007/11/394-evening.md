A little bit of fog in the morning, but then sunshine for the whole day.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071111_083124_nx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071111_083124_nx.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> I shot my first images in the morning when the fog began to clear up. It's always the same view that you have seen so often now, but so have I and I still can't get enough of it. You may probably bear with me ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I spent the time till noon searching a Song of the Day for yesterday's image, slept a little early in the afternoon, and at 3:40pm I set out for an evening session. It's one of the features of this season, that I can go shooting sundowns on Sundays, have dinner, pack my luggage and still be on time for the train to Vienna.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071111_155805_nx_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071111_155805_nx_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> We live in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=ludmannsdorf,+Carinthia,+Austria&ie=UTF8&ll=46.575383,14.06868&spn=0.09617,0.225563&z=13&iwloc=addr&om=1" target="_blank">Ludmannsdorf</a>, on the sunny side of the valley "Rosental", but due to the high mountains, the sun goes down quite early now. It's much better some 15 kilometers to the west, because there the valley widens and the sun goes down directly into another valley, meaning that the horizon is low, and this gives me about 40 more minutes of sun.<br/><br/>The first settlement to the west is <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Sankt+Egyden+Velden+am+W%C3%B6rther+See,+Villach+Land,+Carinthia,+Austria&sll=48.209206,16.372778&sspn=0.372934,0.902252&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=0,46.575701,14.066548&ll=46.575737,14.06662&spn=0.096169,0.225563&z=13&iwloc=addr&om=1" target="_blank">Sankt Egyden</a>. I stopped there and just managed to get some last sun on the church. I like old walls, did I ever mention that?<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071111_164225_nx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071111_164225_nx.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> My final destination was <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=wurzer+weg,+Carinthia,+Austria&sll=46.648488,14.031265&sspn=0.012005,0.028195&ie=UTF8&ll=46.633054,14.060268&spn=0.096068,0.225563&z=13&iwloc=addr&om=1" target="_blank">Wurzen</a> near KÃ¶stenberg. This is a south-looking, rural settlement near the top of the hills between the two lakes WÃ¶rther See and Ossiacher See. I can reach this place in about half an hour, and it is as good as it could be to watch sundowns, at least this time of the year.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day, the farm house, was shot just some minutes before sundown. Last rays of sun on old wood and white-washed walls, a stormy sky, lots of wood stacked up at the barn wall. Winter may come.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the exceedingly beautiful "<a href="http://www.thehighwaystar.com/rosas/pictured_within/lyrics_picwith.html" target="_blank">Evening Song</a>", sung by Sam Brown on  Jon Lord's 1999 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pictured-Within-Jon-Lord/dp/B0000241IO" target="_blank">Pictured Within</a>".
