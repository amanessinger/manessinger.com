This is a park along the 200 meters between my workplace and the entrance to the Underground. When I walked by, on my way to the train, I suddenly saw the peculiar configuration of these trees, the snow sticking to their north sides and the still colored leaves.<br/><br/>Sigma 10-20 at 16mm, f6.7. 1/40s and ISO 100. Post-processing in Capture NX and Photoshop.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071116_082608_ps_bw.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071116_082608_ps_bw.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The other image is from this morning. By chance I saw an open house entrance, walked in and took some images. This is the one I liked most. Post-processing with Photomatix Pro and Photoshop. I've deliberately added some grain. I know that many people detest it, but in some cases it simply looks right.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/enya-amid-the-falling-snow-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Amid the Falling Snow</a>" from Enya's fabulous 2005 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amarantine-Enya/dp/B000B8QEYC" target="_blank">Amarantine</a>".
