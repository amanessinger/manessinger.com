Both were shot yesterday morning on my way to work, both with the Sigma 20/1.8, and this one even wide open at f1.8. Hmm ... pretty dark these days in Vienna. It still gave me no more than 1/125s at ISO 100.<br/><br/>What drew me in the first place, was of course the color, but when this guy walked through the frame, I decided to include him. I guess I like the notion of someone walking out of my frame. There is quite a number of these images in my collection now, and some were even Images of the Day (for instance <a href="/2007/03/153-passage.html" target="_blank">153 - Passage</a>  and  <a href="/2007/05/220-people-are-strange.html" target="_blank">220 - People Are Strange</a>), but it is also inspired by Ted's recent image of an <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/2007/11/spoleto.html" target="_blank">Avvocato</a> walking the streets of Spoleto. <br/><br/>An Avvocato, you ask? How do I know? Oh, I say, just so ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>As regards post-processing, well, I am really not sure about it. Color-wise I may have gone one step too far or maybe not far enough. You decide.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071114_080244_nx.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071114_080244_nx.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The second image would have been a safe bet. It's been shot not far away, this time at f4 and 1/40s. It is a study in geometry and if I admit that I may have something like a style (I like <a href="http://trippingonthrough.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Michael McMurma</a>'s notion that style simply is, to make the same decisions over and again, not always, but significantly more often than otherwise), so if I have a style, then this would be very typical of it.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/f/faithless/one+step+too+far_20052688.html" target="_blank">One Step Too Far</a>" by Faithless, sung by Dido. It's from the 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outrospective-Faithless/dp/B00005LN6L" target="_blank">Outrospective</a>" and you can see the video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFLutCjewvg">YouTube</a>.
