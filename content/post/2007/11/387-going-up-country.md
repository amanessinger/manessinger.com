This image is an HDR image from five bracketed exposures, shot this afternoon in Carinthia, not far from home. Nikon 18-200 at 18mm, f16, shot from the tripod. Tone-mapping was done in Photomatix, further post-processing in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/goingupt.htm" target="_blank">Going up the country</a>", but not by Canned Heat, no, this time by the legendary Bavarian band "Spider Murphy Gang" (they had their 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary this October), from the 2004 live album "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Unplugged-Skandal-Lustspielhaus-Spider-Murphy/dp/B000185A9C" target="_blank">Unplugged,Skandal im Lustspielhaus</a>".
