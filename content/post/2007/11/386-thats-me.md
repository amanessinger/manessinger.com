It is much less cool, but I guess the background makes up for that.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 95mm, 1/8s and f8, shot seconds before sundown.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/That's-Me-lyrics-Paul-Simon/C1A69762E93E432A4825716A001035F1" target="_blank">That's Me</a>" from Paul Simon's 2006 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprise-Paul-Simon/dp/B000F0UV1S" target="_blank">Surprise</a>".
