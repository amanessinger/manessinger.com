Somehow I have crashed my Photoshop installation and I can't get it back to work. At the moment it looks like some bizarre interaction between the Adobe installer and my anti-virus software, but this is only a guess. Repairing the mess could take anything up to a re-installation of the operating system. Whatever, it will have to wait until tomorrow, and for tonight I needed to take a cheap escape route: an image where I can live with not being able to clone.<br/><br/>Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8 and 1/30s, shot this morning on my way to work. Post-processing in Capture NX.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/morrissey-trouble-loves-me-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Trouble Loves Me</a>" from Morrissey's 1997 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maladjusted-Morrissey/dp/B000001EWF" target="_blank">Maladjusted</a>". There are several live versions up on YouTube, for instance <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7n2BBKc0iQ" target="_blank">this one</a>.
