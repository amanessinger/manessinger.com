Only in the evening I could go out and the idea was, to take some images of the local church. HDR and very wide angle, preferably.<br/><br/>It was rubbish. But, interestingly enough, when I fooled around with hand-held images made in non-hand-holdable situations, I found this one: Sigma 10-20 at 17mm, f8, ISO 100 and 7.1s. Yes, seconds.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Oh, How The Ghost Sings" from Lester Bowie's classic album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Pretender-Lester-Bowie/dp/B00002615B" target="_blank">The Great Pretender</a>". I'll never forget the evening when I first heard the title song in one of Vienna's leading Jazz cafÃ©s, "Miles Smiles".
