Again I used the Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8, 1/60s and ISO 100, the front lens almost touching the leaves.<br/><br/>I hope you don't mind that I take the easy road: The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/acharliebrownchristmas/christmastimeishere.htm" target="_blank">Christmas Time Is Here</a>" from Holly Cole's 2001 Christmas album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Cold-Outside-Christmas-Album/dp/B00005RDIU" target="_blank">Baby It's Cold Outside</a>". Sorry, couldn't resist ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Hear sound samples <a href="http://www.virginmegastores.co.uk/product/454168/Holly_Cole__Baby,_It's_Cold_Outside/s.jsf" target="_blank">here</a>. Oh, and when you're there, don't forget to hear into the last song, "What About Me". Holly at her best.
