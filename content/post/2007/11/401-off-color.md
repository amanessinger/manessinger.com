At least when I last looked at it yesterday.<br/><br/>Today's weather is an off-color joke. This image was taken at 3:16pm. We had a bit of snowfall all day, and now the shroud begins to stick. At first I wanted to produce the image in B&amp;W, but then I noticed that it really made no difference, and for demonstration purposes I left it "in color".<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 105mm, f13, ISO 100 and 1/13s, shot from the tripod with mirror lockup.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071118_071547_nx_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071118_071547_nx_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The other image, taken with the Sigma 10-20 at 12mm, f8 and 2s is from our garden. It was only this weekend that I recognized how bleak this landscape had become, how naked and barren it looked. The leaves had fallen, everything was prepared for winter ...<br/><br/>... and now it is here.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Off Color" from The Microscopic Septet's album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surrealistic-Swing-History-Micros-Vol/dp/B000GYHY2W" target="_blank">Surrealistic Swing: History of the Micros, Vol. 2</a>".
