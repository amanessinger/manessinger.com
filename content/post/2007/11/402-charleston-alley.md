Isn't this a wonderful time of the year?<br/><br/>This is an alley where I pass through quite frequently on my way to or from work. I have always felt that its architecture has a certain Italian charm, and this is neither the first Image of the Day shot there, nor will it be the last. "<a href="/2006/11/40-thoroughfare.html" target="_blank">40 - Thoroughfare</a>" is from there and so is "<a href="/2006/11/33-hanging-gardens.html" target="_blank">33 - Hanging Gardens</a>".<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once more one of Jon Hendricks' vocalizations of a Jazz masterpiece, this time it's "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/lambert-hendricks-and-ross-charleston-alley-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Charleston Alley</a>". Hear it on the Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hottest-New-Group-Jazz/dp/B000002ADR" target="_blank">The Hottest New Group in Jazz</a>".
