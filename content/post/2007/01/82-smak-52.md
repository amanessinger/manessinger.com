I shot that image in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=48.20221,16.349738&spn=0.006386,0.008068" target="_blank">Siebensterngasse</a> between Neubaugasse and Zollergasse on my way home from work. I left early to still get some light, but with the new Nikon 50/1.8, even wide open I was down to 1/30 seconds at ISO 400. Goodness, the winter has not even really started here! But at least the days get longer now, if only so slowly.<br/><br/>Over at the Radiant Vista, in a <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/community/showthread.php?t=1734" target="_blank">discussion</a> with <a href="http://www.spiritima.com/" target="_blank">Alec C. Johnson</a> about one of my images, we had the idea of shooting images about titles of Bob Dylan songs. Accidentally my image was titled "<a href="http://bobdylan.com/moderntimes/songs/desolation.html" target="_blank">Desolation Row</a>". Is this a project or is this not a project :-?
