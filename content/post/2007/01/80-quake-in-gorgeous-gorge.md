The road between Franzendorf and Selkach begins narrow, but as soon as you get into the forest, it becomes curvy and steep as well.<br/><br/>I have driven this road maybe 20, 30 times a year for more than 20 years, but it never occurred to me that the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=13&ll=46.541329,14.105158&spn=0.105322,0.118961" target="_blank">gorge</a> at the left side of the street could be a good place for taking photographs. Well, it is ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Today, in order to fill the urgent need for an Image of the Day, I parked the car not far after entering the forest and climbed down. It is not exactly dangerous when you are careful, but it was quite exciting nevertheless. While I was down there I felt something and had the impression of a "bump" as well, and, sure enough, seconds later I got a call from home, inquiring if everything was OK and if I had felt the quake.<br/><br/>This was the second earthquake that I have witnessed in my life, the first one having been the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_4899000/4899320.stm" target="_blank">catastrophe in Gemona</a>, Italy in 1976. This time of course it was completely harmless. Still, when you are down in a narrow gorge between all those boulders, it is a little intimidating.
