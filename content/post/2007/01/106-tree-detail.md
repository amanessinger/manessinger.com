For now a detail must suffice.<br/><br/>I was not exactly active today. Some photos in the very morning, then some in the afternoon, but already in a hurry. This is about the best I could come up with. Seems like I'll have yet to adapt to snow ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>In the evening I saw Dani Levy's new film "<a href="http://www.meinfuehrer-derfilm.de/" target="_blank">Mein FÃ¼hrer</a>" in a small cinema in Klagenfurt. I didn't expect very much and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I don't know if it's going to have any impact on the non german-speaking world, if it is or will be available in English, but this Hitler parody certainly has its creepy moments. <br/><br/>It is the story of Jewish actor/teacher Adolf GrÃ¼nbaum, who in late 1944 is recruited directly from the concentration camp by Josef Goebbels to coach the depressive Hitler for his New Years speech. Absurd? Yes, it is, and funny as well.
