It was an easy calculation:<br/><br/>We live on about 660 meters. The valley ground is at probably 400 meters. The photos from yesterday were made at maybe 520 meters. The terrain is steep. Go figure. There must be waterfalls!<br/><br/>Sure enough there were, and when you go in at the right places, the gorge is even quite accessible.<br/><br/>Time to go to bed now, but let me first add an administrative note: I may not be able to post an Image of the Day for one, probably two days. So, don't worry, I won't be dead ðŸ™‚
