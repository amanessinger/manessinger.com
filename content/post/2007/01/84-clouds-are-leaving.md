I had no single opportunity for an image today, so I had to conjure up something. Well, this is not exactly a marvel of an image, but, on the other hand, I can't always bother you with archive images on Fridays, can I?<br/><br/>This is a 16 minute exposure at ISO 100 and f11, taken with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, but heavily cropped. We have almost full moon tonight and a strange sky with narrow bands of clouds streaming down south. I think they are migrating.
