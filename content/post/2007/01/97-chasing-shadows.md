This evening, when I was on my way home, I saw a group of bicycles fastened to stands, and for a moment when a car drove by behind them, just in the blink of an eye, I saw an amazing amount of rapidly changing shadows. I stood and watched.<br/><br/>Not all cars did this. It took a certain angle to trigger it, but eventually it would happen again. Thus I waited for a promising car approaching in a distance, raised the camera, focused on the bicycles and tried to shoot in the right moment. Well, OK, I could simply have set the D200 to high speed mode and fire off a burst at 5 frames per second, but in a way I deemed that unsportsmanlike. It took me two or three cars to get the shot.
