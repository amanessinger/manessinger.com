<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070102_121703_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070102_121703_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>I don't even pretend to know what this is. I do know where it is. It is in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=48.201731,16.342517&spn=0.006386,0.008068" target="_blank">Westbahnstraße</a>, between the photo shops "blende 7" and "Orator", or in other words, between Kaiserstraße and Schottenfeldgasse.<br/><br/>It really is that yellow. I have not so much added color, I've taken away. What I have added is contrast. If I had not felt so much need to flex my Photoshop muscle, I could have used the original image as well, and in a way this probably would have been even more appropriate. Why? Because this photo is special, that's why. It is the first photo taken with my new Nikon 50/1.8.<br/><br/>You remember, this is the lens I did not buy while in my <a href="/2006/12/76-psychedelic.html" target="_blank">psychedelic</a> mood. Well, in the meantime I got mail from John DeMott, who reminded me of what an exceptional bargain this lens is. Now, who am I to contradict John DeMott :-?<br/><br/>By the way, if you have not seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(film)" target="_blank">it</a> yet, you really should. I feel how it gets more and more important.
