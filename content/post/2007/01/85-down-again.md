<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070106_144500_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070106_144500_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Today was a nice, sunny day. No fog, not even in the morning. I could have gone anywhere, I could have enjoyed the sunshine, but no, I went down again, down into the gorge. The one with the <a href="/2007/01/80-quake-in-gorgeous-gorge.html" target="_blank">quake</a>, you know, only this time without a quake. Not that I've missed it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This time it was easy and not at all dangerous to climb down. When you look a little, there is even kind of a path.<br/><br/>I had to do some cleanup when I was there. Mostly branches, but a plastic bottle as well. The rest, removing some big piece of ice that simply looked wrong, was done in Photoshop.
