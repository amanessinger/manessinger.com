I finally settled with this image of the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=48.196339,16.341047&spn=0.006379,0.007478" target="_blank">Stafa</a> house at the corner Kaiserstraße/Mariahilfer Straße. Stafa is one of the traditional department stores in Vienna, that got renovated radically some years ago. The sculptures from 1911 were kept as part of the facade, but most of it is glass now. <br/><br/>When I walked by in the morning on my way to the underground (I do that most Fridays, because of the luggage) it was lit by warm sunlight and reflected the opposite side of the street. I had mounted the Nikon 50/1.8 the night before, was in a hurry, and there was not much I could do compositionally, because of the cables, street lights, etc, but as it turned out, I like it. I had to help along a bit with colors and contrast after the fact, but otherwise this is exactly what drew my attention.<br/><br/>No story of the day today. Sorry.
