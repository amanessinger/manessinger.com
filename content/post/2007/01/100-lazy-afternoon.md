Normally I'd have said that 100 days go by as nothing, much too quick, leaving no traces. Now, almost a third of a year in this project, that is all about leaving traces, I feel different. When I look at the early images and all the progress since, then I can remember every one of these moments I've captured. There is no other period in my life that is documented so well, besides maybe some voyages that I cared to take a camera with me, but that were never more than two weeks.<br/><br/>So there is a documentary aspect to it, but I strongly feel, that I have made artistic progress as well. Not that all these images are as good as I'd like them to be in hindsight, but overall I see my abilities to express myself in photographs increase. Ultimately, of course, the judgment must be your's.<br/><br/>After the Photoshop orgy yesterday, I have slept long and allowed myself the luxury of a lazy afternoon. Just like yesterday's image, this one is a combination of two exposures with different lighting, a technique I found very successful for this kind of macro shots. Lighting may not be entirely realistic, but with a subject like this from so near, it would be hard to judge anyway.
