In the evening I took the underground to "<a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=16&ll=48.218797,16.369114&spn=0.012767,0.016136" target="_blank">Donaukanal</a>". I wanted to take some photographs under bridges. Hmm ... should I ever need graffiti again, I know where to go! <br/><br/>I took some bracketed exposures and developed them as HDR, but nothing turned out particularly exciting. So here is a single exposure taken with the Nikon 18-200 at 112 mm, f11 and 80 seconds. I would have taken more but for the cold. Well, fine, tomorrow it's off to Carinthia, and there is even snow ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If you are a smoker like I was until one and a half years ago, look at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/science/26brain.html?hp&ex=1169787600&en=47216463b30ce387&ei=5094&partner=homepage" target="_blank">this</a>. Why does it remind me of lobotomy? I mean, would you let them tinker with your brain?  I certainly wouldn't!
