I did and found them in the frenzy of dancing the Rites of Winter! What a surprise ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This is one of the images I wanted to throw away at first. Not sure if you know the effect, but when you press the Lensbaby too much, you get a blurry spot where the sweetspot should be, surrounded by a circular, swirling distortion. That's what happened here, and it is one of the rare cases when I like it. It is what keeps the dancer in the center in motion.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryszard_Kapu?ci?ski" target="_blank">Ryszard Kapu?ci?ski</a> has died in Warsaw. It already happened on Tuesday, but I think I should mention it. He has written, among others, some fantastic books about Africa. If you haven't read anything by him, give them a try.<br/><br/>As for a story of the day, I think <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/23/sex.workers/index.html" target="_blank">this one</a> about a Cambodian woman who tries to rescue children from sex slavery applies. Honestly, if this is good news, then the world has come pretty far.
