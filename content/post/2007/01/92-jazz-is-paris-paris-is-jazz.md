I own the single CD that was released in Europe, not the American double CD, so I can't comment on the instrumental versions. Some <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:g3320r3at48z" target="_blank">critics</a> don't seem to like it, but I declare it one of the best albums ever released, hymnical, erotic, dripping emotion. Actually, not only do I think of it, I'm hearing it right now and it is pure bliss.<br/><br/>This is to Malcolm, Catherine Deneuve, Francoise Hardy, Amina and all the musicians who made this incredibly great album.<br/><br/>Photographically this day was a bit thin. I bought a laptop, tried to rescue some camera buyers from a seller who had no clue at all, and by the time I got back to the car it was already so late, that I decided to buy some orange lilies and use my under-used macro. So I did late at night, and while some of the images actually looked very good the way they came out of the camera, I fooled around with one of them, partially inverted the colors and found that I liked it.<br/><br/>Jazz is Paris, Paris is Jazz
