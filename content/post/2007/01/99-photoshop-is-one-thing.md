I had a late breakfast, did yesterday's Image of the Day and left at 14:15 for Klagenfurt to get another 2GB, this time for the Carinthian PC. I'll tell you one thing: if you can possible manage it, stick to one PC. Keeping two up to date is rather expensive ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Anyway. I got it and then began to wonder where to go shooting. Rather half-heartedly I decided for <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=13&ll=46.688544,14.292526&spn=0.105036,0.119648" target="_blank">Ulrichsberg</a>, a mountain north of Klagenfurt, infamous for the yearly commemoration of the referendum that ended the 1918-20 occupation of southern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops. The referendum decided that southern Carinthia should stay with Austria, and I think that was a good thing, but the problem is, that the commemoration on Ulrichsberg attracts all sorts of right-wing people, ex-Nazi soldiers as well as young neo-Nazi, and it is rather unpleasant to see how Carinthian politicians of all parties mess about with them.<br/><br/>The weather was, hmm, interesting. The northern sky was clear and wonderfully blue, but in the south where the sun was, there lurked clouds that moved, and I yet had to figure out the direction. I deemed it possible to get some sun up there, but as I was about to leave the car and walk up to the summit, it became clear that the clouds would stay just in front of the sun for some time. Disappointed I got back into the car and drove down again and to Karnburg, just at the southern foot of the mountain.<br/><br/>In the middle ages Karnburg once was an important center of early Carinthia, but now it is only a small village. It has a nice old church nevertheless, and I decided to take some images there. I did so, albeit in very flat light, drove back to Klagenfurt, took some images there, and finally drove to the supermarket to get some provisions.<br/><br/>At home I found no clear candidate for an Image of the Day. One of the Karnburg images was sort of OK and so was one from Klagenfurt. I don't tell you what an insane amount of time I spent, trying to make one of those images something that I would be proud to post. Alas, Photoshop is one thing, and the quality of an image is another. Sure, I did make them look better, but whatever I did, they still failed to impress me.<br/><br/>Luckily enough I had bought an orchid for just such cases. At about 3am I gave up riding dead horses, mounted the Sigma 150/2.8 macro and gave the orchid a try. Well, I guess I could have had that earlier ðŸ™‚
