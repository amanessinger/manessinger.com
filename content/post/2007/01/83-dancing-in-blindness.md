I used the Nikon 50/1.8 wide open.<br/><br/>The other thing is, that I have opened an account at photo.net, uploaded the image from  <a href="/2006/12/74-out-of-fog.html" target="_blank">74 - Out of the Fog</a> and given three critiques there. It's amazing how fast-moving that community is. I got 20 ratings in the first hour, my image was for maybe that time on page one of the top-rated photos, and now it is already at page three or four, that means quick exposure, early oblivion. Anyway, I have always liked photo.net for the incredible quality of so much of the work there, and simply wanted to be a part of it.
