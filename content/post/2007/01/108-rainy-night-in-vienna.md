I stood in front of the post office in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=48.206271,16.356411&spn=0.006385,0.008068" target="_blank">Museumsstra√üe</a>, facing south. It did not rain for some minutes, the lights reflected nicely and people passed by. The image, taken with the Nikon 18-200 at 200mm, is unaltered, just from out of the camera. <br/><br/>Yesterday I presented a link to an article about what to expect from Windows Vista. So, if Vista is not the cure for the security problems that have plagued Windows for all those years, what is it then?<br/><br/>I like to think about it this way:<br/><br/>It is a perfect vehicle to sell new hardware. It is the same as with Windows XP, but more forceful now. It looks different, admittedly better, you can't do anything you could not do before, but it needs much more powerful hardware. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it's not only that. It has DRM (the industry says "Digital Rights Management", we say "<a href="http://drm.info/fsfe/why" target="_blank">Digital Restriction Management</a>" or "<a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/" target="_blank">Defective by Design</a>") built into its core. This is the very technology that the content mafia will use to force you to buy the same things all over again, but this time not to own them, no, only to have the right to view or hear the content according to <span style="font-weight:bold;">their</span> rules.<br/><br/>For a thorough discussion of DRM and its consequences also have a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> article. DRM proponents would say it's biased as well, but, what the heck, you get their point of view shoven down by their own propaganda all the time.
