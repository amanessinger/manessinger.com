For a change, this time it was SmugMug's fault. I was too tired yesterday evening to prepare the Image of the Day and decided to do it in the morning before going to work. I did so, but then SmugMug was down.<br/><br/>I took this image yesterday noon in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=16&ll=48.207694,16.360713&spn=0.01277,0.016136" target="_blank">Volksgarten</a>,  that's where I shot those spooky guys who were <a href="/2007/01/83-dancing-in-blindness.html" target="_blank">83 - Dancing in Blindness</a>. I did it with the Nikon 50/1.8 at f4.<br/><br/>And then there is some new equipment to report. My PC here in Vienna has now 2GB of memory. Boy, that's a difference! The downside is, that I'll have to do it in Carinthia as well. The beauty of having two computers ðŸ™‚
