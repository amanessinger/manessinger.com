This friendly guy works with me and has allowed me to post the image as long as I don't mention his name.<br/><br/>Actually I make photos of the guys at work all the time ("Oh no! Not again!"), but most of them so far suffered from the usually distracting backgrounds. Now, that was one reasons for buying the Nikon 50/1.8. It's bokeh may not be as creamy as that of the famous 85/1.4 (we'll see when I have it, maybe sometime in Spring), but it costs only 1/10<sup>th</sup> of it, and it makes for a very handy portrait lens on a crop-factor camera. I'm loving it!
