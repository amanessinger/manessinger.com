This afternoon I was a little torn apart between staying at home taking macro shots, and taking the car to shoot somewhere in late afternoon light. My decision fell for "somewhere", and that turned out to be the problem. I had no plan. Don't ever do that. It brings you to nothing. Or in my case to Reifnitz.<br/><br/>Being stranded there (well, I don't want to be unjust, there are worse places to be) and precious little time left before the sun would dip behind the mountain, as no wide-angle scene would unfold, I changed from the Sigma 10-20 to the Nikon 50/1.8 to shoot some details as long as the sun would be up. This is one of them.<br/><br/>The pier in Reifnitz, secured with a rope. A little bit ridiculous, but that's how it is.
