I slept in the afternoon and left home only at 5pm for some swimming. I took this photo from the tripod, exposure bracketing with 1 EV apart, and later I have processed it with Photomatix and Photoshop, taking the HDR result from Photomatix as one of three pixel-based layers, the other two being a light and a dark exposure. The process was not at all controlled. I simply did what seemed appropriate.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.spiritofsinatra.com/pages/Lyrics/a/At_Sundown.htm" target="_blank">At Sundown</a>" from Betty Carter's 1958 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Cant-Help-Betty-Carter/dp/B000003N6D" target="_blank">I Can't Help It</a>".
