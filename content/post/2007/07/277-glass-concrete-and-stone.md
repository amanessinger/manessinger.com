We had 37.8 degrees Celsius, this is a whopping 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a good excuse to spend a lazy day. Among other things I was in the gardens of SchÃ¶nbrunn, the baroque emperor's palace of Vienna. On my way back to the underground I took a route along the glass houses of the imperial household. <br/><br/>I took this image with the Nikon 18-200VR at 18mm, at f8 and with polarizer. Basic conversion was done in Capture NX, distortion correction with PTLens and toning in Photoshop.<br/><br/>David Byrne has the Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/david_byrne/glass_concrete_stone.html" target="_blank">Glass, Concrete and Stone</a>" from his latest album (oops, that was 2004 - time goes by) "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grown-Backwards-David-Byrne/dp/B0001D3KNK" target="_blank">Grown Backwards</a>". There is also a full-length video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLSRddJvTZg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. I have no idea how stable these links are, technically it is copyrighted material, and as such it may be taken down at any time, so enjoy as long as it's possible ðŸ™‚
