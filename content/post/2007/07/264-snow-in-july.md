Well, it is worse. There is even snow on the mountain tops! Snow in July!<br/><br/>This is an HDR image made of 9 exposures, bracketed in 1EV distance. I was in a hurry and did not use the cable release, thus there is no perfect alignment, even though I used a tripod. Thankfully you can't see it at this size ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I have merged and tone-mapped the image in Photomatix, saved as TIFF, and done further processing in Photoshop. Mostly I have sucked yellow out of the sundown (too colorful highlights, that's one of the problems that HDR merging often brings) and adjusted contrasts locally using different curves, and then painting in the masks.<br/><br/>Dakota Moon is a band that had their self-titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dakota-Moon/dp/B0000062Q9" target="_blank">debut album</a> in 1998. Searching my collection for the word "snow", I found that they have a song called "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/dakota+moon/snow+in+july_20288099.html" target="_blank">Snow in July</a>", and of course that's the Song of the Day.
