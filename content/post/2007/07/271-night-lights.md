Sorry for the delay, I was simply too tired yesterday.<br/><br/>I shot this image shortly before midnight, after dinner with dear friends. It's again taken with the new Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8. There is not much sharpness here, this is all about night lights.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Nat King Cole's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/nat+king+cole/night+lights_20098072.html" target="_blank">Night Lights</a>", and I have it on a very cheap collection of three CDs titled "Anthology". I guess it's not available any more, therefore I link to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Night-Lights-Nat-King-Cole/dp/B00005IA0F" target="_blank">album</a> of the same name released in 2001. My version is a live recording from some club, less polished, and I like it more, but if you don't know the song, you'll still get an impression.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you want to vote for my blog on <a href="http://vote.photoblogawards.com/photoblog.php?title=The_Daily_Photography_of_Andreas_Manessinger" target="_blank">Photoblog Awards 2007</a>, please don't be shy ðŸ˜‰
