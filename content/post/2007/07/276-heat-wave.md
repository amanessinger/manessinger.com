Our's does not come from the Isle of Martinique though, but rather from North Africa. At the moment, about 11pm, I sit in my living room, all windows open, not the slightest breeze, it has around 85 degrees Fahrenheit or 30 degrees Celsius, and the forecast has temperatures rising.<br/><br/>I shot this image at about 7:30pm in baking <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.209289,16.351594&amp;spn=0.005806,0.014098&z=17&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Josefstädter Straße</a>, again with the Sigma 20/1.8, this time at f8. It's maybe 10 or 15 meters from where I shot "<a href="/2007/06/243-evening-shadows.html" target="_blank">243 - Evening Shadows</a>".<br/><br/>The Song of the day is Irving Berlin's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/i/irving+berlin/heat+wave_20068100.html" target="_blank">Heat Wave</a>", and I have it from the usual suspects. Today it is again Holly Cole on her album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shade-Holly-Cole/dp/B00009VYNM" target="_blank">Shade</a>". It is really a shame that Amazon have no sound samples, not even in their Canadian department, but I have found it in the music store of <a href="http://www.cmtmusicstore.ca/album.aspx?albumID=23894" target="_blank">cmt.ca</a>.<br/><br/>Edit: I just checked, they sell WMA (Windows Media Audio) only and the songs you buy there will not play on a Mac. Can any Mac user enlighten me please: do you hear at least the sound samples???
