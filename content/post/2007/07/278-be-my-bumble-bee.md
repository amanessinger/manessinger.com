Not that long ago? OK, when was the last time you did it with a wide-angle lens??<br/><br/>It's the Sigma 20/1.8 again, and not all is well today. This is the first time I'm having trouble with a Sigma lens. It front-focuses badly for everything below f8 and distances above a meter. I didn't recognize it at first, because it does not occur when you use the lens as a macro. I'll have them fix it, but that will have to wait another week, because next week I'm in Germany and I want to take the lens with me. In the meantime I use the lens in manual focus mode. It's not really a problem, because I only have to set it to infinity and then come back down until the focus indicator just begins to light up.<br/><br/>What is the Song of the Day? I have a "Bumble Bee Blues", and that would stick, but when I think about it, it's really the Muddy Waters hit "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rolling+stones/im+a+king+bee_20118189.html" target="_blank">I'm a King Bee</a>", interpreted by The Rolling Stones on their 1964 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Englands-Newest-Hitmakers-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006AW2P" target="_blank">England's Newest Hitmakers</a>".<br/><br/>There are quite some covers available at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22I%27m+a+king+bee%22&search=" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, and one of them even by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA6uolaLXTI" target="_blank">Jim Morrison</a> and the Doors. I certainly didn't know that ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>And when you're at it, please try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5vwfwZ6D_U" target="_blank">Frank Marino &amp; Mahogany Rush</a> as well. They're that good. Really.
