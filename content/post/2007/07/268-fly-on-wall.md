Today, like every year for one day, the road was closed for cars, it was Ironman day. Actually I hate it. It was a wonderful day, I would have wanted to go swimming, and instead I had to stay home. But in every Evil there is Good, right? Each year I say to myself that this is a wonderful chance to practice panning, and like every other year I didn't. Oh well!<br/><br/>Now when it came to shooting for an Image of the Day, I took the easy road, unpacked the Sigma 150 macro and the macro flash kit, crawled around the house for 15 minutes, and came back with a fly, two spiders and some ants. Boy, is this hard to shoot marching ants! At least the other guys were patient and I could have used the tripod as well ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Fly on the Wall" by female Blues singer Marcia Ball from Louisiana, now living in Austin, TX. It's from her 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presumed-Innocent-Marcia-Ball/dp/B00005B1DL" target="_blank">Presumed Innocent</a>", the first one of her that I bought after having found it in a shop by chance. If you don't know her, give it a try. I've just ordered the five albums that I didn't already have ðŸ™‚
