It's an old farm house, and when you come from St. Egyden, it is left of the street, right after you have entered <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=46.589423,14.110909&spn=0.113368,0.21183&z=13&om=1" target="_blank">Schiefling</a>.  It is a very old house between new houses, the contrast being striking when you see it, but the houses are so far apart that it makes no sense trying to frame it.<br/><br/>This is not the first time that I shot this house. This time I went for a mostly abstract image, reduced to the constituents of old farm houses, arranged in a grid of lines and colored rectangles.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/n/neil+young/words_20098992.html" target="_blank">Words (Between The Lines Of Age)</a>" from Neil Young's classic 1972 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Neil-Young/dp/B000002KD1" target="_blank">Harvest</a>".
