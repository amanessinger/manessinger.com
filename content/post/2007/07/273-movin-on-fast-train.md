Well, I had the choices of either annoying you with another flower image, or breaking the Law and presenting you an image from Wednesday night that I really like. I chose to break the Law, after all, it's mine ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I shot this image maybe ten minutes after the one from "<a href="/2007/07/271-night-lights.html" target="_blank">271 - Night Lights</a>", and again I used the new Sigma 20/1.8.<br/><br/>More choices. Yesterday I chose to not take my camera into the concert of Romanian brass band "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanfare_Cioc%C4%83rlia" target="_blank">Fanfare Cioc?rlia</a>". Bad choice! The concert was one of the best I've ever seen, and at the end they simply left the stage and played on in the foyer, in the midst of a dancing crowd. Spectacular! Ecstatic! I could have shot a hundred images, but on the other hand, dancing in ecstasy was not a bad choice either ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>If you don't know Fanfare Cioc?rlia, you really should sample some of their albums, e.g. the 2001 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iag-Bari-Fanfare-Ciocarlia/dp/B00005O84Z" target="_blank">Iag Bari</a>" or the recent "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Queens-Kings-Fanfare-Ciocarlia/dp/B000MRA45W" target="_blank">Queens and Kings</a>". Or any other. They are all that good.<br/><br/>But back to this image. It is not that it is terribly original, there are millions of images shot of the reflection in a scooter's mirror, and even I have made some of them, but what I like in this particular one is the lucky moment, the dynamism that lies in the antagonism between the parking car and the moving train. And there's more to it. If you only look at the car, it looks like moving as well, just before an imminent crash with the viewer.<br/><br/>The Song of the day is Van Morrison's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/v/van+morrison/fast+train_20143320.html" target="_blank">Fast Train</a>", but here are choices again. Van Morrison himself on a bonus track to his 2002 album "Down the Road" (we had the album in "<a href="/2007/06/243-evening-shadows.html" target="_blank">243 - Evening Shadows</a>")? Or better Solomon Burke on his 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Give-Up-Solomon-Burke/dp/B000068CTE" target="_blank">Don't Give Up on Me</a>"? My choice is Solomon Burke, and what is your's?
