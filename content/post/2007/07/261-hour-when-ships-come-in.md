I have seen this all my life, but not before I began photographing, have I consciously experienced how bad the light during the middle of the day is. Unfortunately this is exactly the time when I am on my way during holidays. Therefore we are in the evening again, this time a little before sundown, and it's the boats in Mali Losinj's harbor.<br/><br/>Again Bob Dylan? Why not. This is an old song, it's from his 1964 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Times-They-Are-Changin/dp/B0009MAP9A" target="_blank">The Times They Are A-Changin'</a>", it's called "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/shipcomes.html" target="_blank">When The Ship Comes In</a>", and it is the Song of the Day.
