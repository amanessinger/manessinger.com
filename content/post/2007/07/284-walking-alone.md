I've spent the whole day in bed, well, at least those times that I could stay off of the toilet. It must be something that I've eaten yesterday. I hate it, but don't worry, it will go away.<br/><br/>This is Worms' "Festplatz" or festival place. This is not where the festival, that I'm here for, takes place, it seems to be more of a circus ground or place for occasional Rock concerts. The funny thing is this fountain, that seems so completely out of place.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is from Sophie B. Hawkins' 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Timbre-Sophie-B-Hawkins/dp/B00005B55A" target="_blank">Timbre</a>" and is called "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/sophie+b.+hawkins/i+walk+alone_20127795.html" target="_blank">I Walk Alone</a>".
