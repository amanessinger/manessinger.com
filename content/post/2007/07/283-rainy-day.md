Mondays are quiet days here, and we decided to just drive around a little and get an impression of the landscape. Well, we had rather bad luck, it was a little bit rainy most of the day, and that changed to solid rain in the afternoon.<br/><br/>This image was taken in a small village, to be honest, I can't remember its name right now. I used the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm. Post-processing was done in Photoshop, using the original, two layers treated with Photomatix tone mapping, different blending modes, masks, Lab manipulations and who-knows-what ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is John Lee Hooker's "Rainy Day" from the 1997 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Look-Back-John-Hooker/dp/B000000WD2" target="_blank">Don't Look Back</a>". Sorry, I found no lyrics.
