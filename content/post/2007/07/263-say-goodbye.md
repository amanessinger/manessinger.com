Yesterday I took a final round of swimming in the deep blue of the sea, and then we left Mali Losinj and the spiders of Cres at about noon. This image is from breakfast. I normally don't have ice cream for breakfast, but in that climate it was perfectly OK.<br/><br/>I sat there in one of the cafés along the promenade, stunned at how empty the marina was (on the other hand, if you had a boat on such a day, what would you do but use it?), and then I saw the street lamps. They were a gift of the city of Varaždin to the city of Mali Losinj, and somehow they have an oriental quality that fascinates me. I took some images of this group of lamps, some of one lamp alone, and that was it for the day. Everything else were documentary shots.<br/><br/>For the Song of the Day I wanted something with the words "say goodbye", and "Time to Say Goodbye" by blind Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman wouldn't have been too wrong, but I still settled with Cole Porter's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/ella+fitzgerald/evry+time+we+say+goodbye_20045722.html" target="_blank">Everytime We Say Goodbye</a>". What version? Ella? Too sweet. Ray Charles and Betty Carter sometime in the 1960s? Too sweet as well. Annie Lennox on the "Red, Hot + Blue" AIDS benefit album? Not really. Betty Carter? Somehow cool and not bad for so much blue color.<br/><br/>No, it's even cooler still, yet there is all the longing in it that I feel for the south and the sun. It's instrumental, it's John Coltrane on his 1960 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Favorite-Things-John-Coltrane/dp/B000002I53" target="_blank">My Favorite Things</a>".
