Anyway, here it is, a trailer for transporting boats. I took the image yesterday when I was on my way to Gänsehäufl, Vienna's biggest bath, and in fact, as I recently heard, the biggest in whole Europe. Whatever this means. They can't have taken into account the beaches of Italy, can they?<br/><br/>I still shoot with my mis-calibrated Sigma 20/1.8, and in fact, manually focusing is absolutely OK. 1/40s at f1.8 and ISO 140.<br/><br/>When it come to the Song of the Day, Eric Clapton is a frequent guest here, and so he is today with a song from his 1974 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/461-Ocean-Boulevard-Eric-Clapton/dp/B000002G89" target="_blank">461 Ocean Boulevard</a>": Robert Johnson's "<a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Eric-Clapton/Steady-Rollin-Man.html" target="_blank">Steady Rollin' Man</a>".<br/><br/>That's for yesterday. The entry for today follows in an hour. Promised.
