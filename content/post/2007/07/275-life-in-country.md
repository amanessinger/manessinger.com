It's insanely late, so I have to keep this short.<br/><br/>I shot this image today in the afternoon, when I was on my way to Keutschacher See for swimming. It's something we call a "rider", a wooden rack, not very unlike a fence, that farmers use to dry hay. They have become very rare now and I expect them to completely vanish soon.<br/><br/>It's again the Sigma 20/1.8 with post-processing in Capture NX.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Johnny Cash's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/j/johnny+cash/country+trash_20173879.html" target="_blank">Country Trash</a>" from the 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-III-Solitary-Johnny-Cash/dp/B000062X9B" target="_blank">American III: Solitary Man</a>".<br/><br/>Goodness! That was short. But I said it ðŸ™‚
