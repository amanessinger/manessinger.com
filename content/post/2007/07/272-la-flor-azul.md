Not the worst of flowers though. I have no idea what it is. It's actually more of a brush with blossoms than a proper flower. I tried to find it via Google's image search, had no success, and therefore I come back to Flo's offer: Please tell me what it is ðŸ™‚<br/><br/> I am still learning to work with my new Sigma 20/1.8. This is one of those images where I come very near, effectively a macro shot, but in this case I wanted most of the flower sharp, therefore I used f5.6. <br/><br/>You see the shadow? Well, that's me, and I am very unsatisfied that I didn't see it when I was there. Had I recognized it, I would have taken another image without shadow. Afterwards I probably would still have taken this image though. I like the shadow. It lends the image a certain quality, a quality of passing time, the quality of a precious moment fleeting, a quality that makes this image dear to me. I guess this is one of my more fortunate mistakes ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Mercedes Sosa's "<a href="http://www.lyricsday.com/MERCEDES_SOSA-La_Flor_Azul_Lyrics-lyrics-660101.html" target="_blank">La Flor Azul</a>", the blue flower, from her live album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mercedes-Sosa-en-Argentina/dp/B0000015SU" target="_blank">Mercedes Sosa en Argentina</a>".
