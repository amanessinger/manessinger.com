Not completely well, but better. Good enough for a trip to the city of Speyer, a short while south of Worms, and another city with a big and famous cathedral. This is not the cathedral though, it's one of the streets leading up to it, a street that curves a little. I took the image with the Nikon 18-200 VR.<br/><br/>I found nothing applicable for the Song of the Day, so Bill suggested "<a href="http://www.carlinamerica.com/titles/titles.cgi?MODULE=LYRICS&ID=864&amp;terms=1966" target="_blank">Inside - Looking Out</a>" on The Animals' "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Retrospective-Animals/dp/B0002IQABI" target="_blank">Retrospective</a>" album, whereas Rick Orrell voted for Melissa Etheridge's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/melissa+etheridge/come+to+my+window_20091637.html" target="_blank">Come To My Window</a>" from her 1993 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yes-I-Am-Melissa-Etheridge/dp/B000001G0U" target="_blank">Yes I Am</a>". Thanks Bill, thanks Rick.<br/><br/>Btw: If you haven't been to <a href="http://web.mac.com/wbirtch/iWeb/B%20Birtch%20Photo/Augmented%20Reality.html" target="_blank">Bill Birch's "Augmented Reality"</a> yet, why not look today? Or maybe <a href="http://ricardo38.smugmug.com/" target="_blank">Rick Orrell</a>'s Smugmug site?
