If you are there, don't miss it. It is incredible in its tranquil beauty.<br/><br/>Apart from that, we saw a former monastery that is now the museum of Worms, and then of course the cathedral.<br/><br/>Sacred architecture, regardless of culture, always tries to transcend, to break on through to the other side, but this is not the reason for the title. This church has two choirs, one on the east side as usual, and one on the west side. This is the west choir.<br/><br/>In earlier times both choirs must have been similar, but of course today the east choir is mutilated by a baroque altar, so you don't get a feeling for the original architecture of the 11<sup>th</sup> century. Therefore I chose the other side.<br/><br/>Can I resist? No, of course I can't. The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/doors/break+on+through+2_20042628.html" target="_blank">Break On Through (To The Other Side)</a>" from The Doors' 1967 debut album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8" target="_blank">The Doors</a>". These medieval churches really got high, baby, so high!
