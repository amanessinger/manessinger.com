It's purple, but what do you want? "Purple Rain" over and again? On the other hand, when I search my music library for the word "blue" in a title, do you have an idea how many "Blues" turn up?<br/><br/>Anyway. These are cranesbills, aka "hardy geraniums" or "true geraniums". How do I know? I have used the Google image search on the term "blue garden flowers". It took me three pages of images to get me on the track of "geranium", and a lookup of "geranium" on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geranium" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> convinced me. Amazing. Only five years ago I would have had to print the image and show it to a gardener. Oh yes, and probably I could have bought a book, but neither would I have been able to do within 20 minutes in the convenience of my living room, and both would have had to wait until tomorrow.<br/><br/>I shot these flowers today, later in the afternoon, on my way home. Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8 and 1/640s. Is that creamy or what?<br/><br/>Elvis' "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/elvis+presley/moody+blue_20049670.html" target="_blank">Moody Blue</a>" is the Song of the Day. It is actually quite macho, when I think of it. A guy wondering about women's unpredictability. "La donna Ã¨ mobile" reborn as a pop song. I have it on a compilation called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ELVIS-2ND-NONE-Elvis-Presley/dp/samples/B0000AUHOX" target="_blank">ELVIS 2ND TO NONE</a>". It was the successor to "ELV1S 30 #1 Hits". Isn't that ingenious? Aren't they cool? Oh how I love those marketing guys ðŸ™‚
