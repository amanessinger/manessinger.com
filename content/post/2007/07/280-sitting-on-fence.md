I finally settled with this one, shot after having arrived in Carinthia late afternoon. It's again the Sigma 20/1.8 , and in the moment I can't get enough of this remarkable lens. Let me repeat: 20cm focusing distance, combined with f1.8, that's wide-angle macro at its finest.<br/><br/>The Housemartins were a 1980s band from Hull, England, and after their split in 1988 they formed Fatboy Slim and The Beautiful South. Funny, aye?<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/housemartins/sitting+on+a+fence_20066081.html" target="_blank">Sitting on a Fence</a>" is from their first album, the 1986 release "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/London-0-Hull-4-Housemartins/dp/B000002H3Z" target="_blank">London 0 Hull 4</a>".
