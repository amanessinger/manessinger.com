Still, I'm at least back with the image of Saturday. <br/><br/>I arrived in Mali Losinj right for dinner and some sundown shots. The sundown was mediocre, I tried some experiments with filters and flashes (only the weak flashes of my macro flash kit), produced nothing of value, and finally changed back from the Sigma 10-20 to the Sigma 30/1.4, a more appropriate lens for night street photography.<br/><br/>This guy sells paintings, the typical kind that you get in tourist centers, but the image reminds me a little of these baroque paintings about painters presenting their work. And then there is this woman to the left, who is completely oblivious to me and obviously everyone else (and everyone else to her), this woman who adjusts her décoltée.<br/><br/>In terms of post-processing I have darkened some distractions near the edges of the frame, brought back some detail into the paintings on the upper rows (they were burnt out in the JPEG) and finally have blurred the face of the woman.<br/><br/>I have not brought along my music library, thus there is no Song of the Day. Sorry, we'll be back to that with the first blog entry that I'll write from home, supposedly  tomorrow, Tuesday night.
