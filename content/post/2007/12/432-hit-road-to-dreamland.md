Yesterday I finally gave in to an urge that had buggered me for half a year now, the urge to buy another macro lens, one that would be better suited to street photography than my Sigma 150/2.8.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071219_190709_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071219_190709_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> "Street photography?", you say, "Why on earth would anyone use a macro lens to go out on the street?". <br/><br/>To get into Dreamland, of course, that's why! This brand new Sigma 70/2.8 macro lets me get near to a reflection in a car or to an advertising on the post of a street sign, and then throw lights in the background wildly out of focus. Out on the street, this is not a lens to portrait reality, it's a lens to create dreams.<br/><br/>Both images were shot wide open at f2.8.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is the Harold Arlen / Johnny Mercer standard "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/datewithjohnwaters/hittheroadtodreamland.htm" target="_blank">Hit The Road To Dreamland</a>" and while it's certainly enjoyable to listen to Jane Monheit (and see her) on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPCaPt6DFG0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, I'll recommend a different version today. It's from Dr. John's 2006 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mercernary-Dr-John/dp/B000E5L88E" target="_blank">Mercernary</a>", and it's as much Mac Rebennack as it gets ðŸ™‚
