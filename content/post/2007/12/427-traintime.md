It's gets increasingly harder to make images these days. We had snow in Vienna (thankfully not in Carinthia where I am now), not much, but enough to completely level out the light and drain everything of colors. I shot this image at about 4pm, and if there would have been sun, it would already have been down by that time.<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 18mm, f8, 1/15s and ISO 2000. Yes, 2000! Goodness, is that dark ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cream/train+time_20327146.html" target="_blank">Traintime</a>" from the 1968 Cream live album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Fire-Cream/dp/B0000067L3" target="_blank">Wheels of Fire</a>".
