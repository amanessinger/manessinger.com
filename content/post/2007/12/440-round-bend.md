Both profit from the compression of the lens and from the fact that I have chosen a flat angle on a bend in the rails.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071227_171127_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071227_171127_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> The one to the right was major work in post-processing, because while shooting, I had already given up on it. For this view I had to stand in the middle of the street, something that I was able to do every couple of minutes for maybe 30 seconds. Normally I am quite patient, but in this case it was freezing cold, and when the third attempt ended with a person in the right place, but a car in the wrong one, I gave up. Finally at home, I found out that I didn't have so many usable images, and I decided to tackle this and take the car out. <br/><br/>This is ISO 1800 and f2.8 at 1/100s, but actually it looked much worse, because the image was severely underexposed. Oh well, never forget to reset exposure compensation ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Image of the Day was shot some minutes later, with f2.8 as well, but now at ISO 3200 and 1/80s. ISO 3200 is my current setting for maximum ISO and with this lens I set minimum speed at 1/100s. In this case the light had not sufficed, thus the camera had given in on shutter speed. And all that is fully automatic. Marvelous!<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/b/beck/round+the+bend_20015366.html" target="_blank">Round The Bend</a>" from Beck's 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sea-Change-Beck/dp/B00006F7S4" target="_blank">Sea Change</a>".
