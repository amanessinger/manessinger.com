On the Radiant Vista, answering Ted's images of Ponte Vecchio, I posted an image, showing the ghosts of the night filing out of Florence. And now this: a spooky old house on a cold winter night.<br/><br/>We had ghastly weather all day, starting with snow in the morning, and I was not overly inclined to go out shooting. On the other hand, I needed an image, and so I left for Klagenfurt in the evening, with only a vague idea of old walls, mixed light and decay.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061104_165428_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2006/20061104_165428_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> This house is on the southern entrance road to Klagenfurt, and I am afraid it will be torn down soon, like so many places that would have done perfectly tonight, but that only exist in my memories now. The image to the left is from about a year ago. I think I have posted it then on the Radiant Vista.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Kurt Weill's "<a href="http://www.free-lyrics.org/Betty-Carter/32500-Lonely-House.html" target="_blank">Lonely House</a>" in the spectacular interpretation of the great Betty Carter. It's on her 1996 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yours-Youre-Mine-Betty-Carter/dp/B00000474Z" target="_blank">I'm Yours, You're Mine</a>".
