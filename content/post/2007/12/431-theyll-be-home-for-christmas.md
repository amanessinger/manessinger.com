I had a completely different image in mind all day, I had an idea what to write about it, but it somehow didn't materialize ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>And then, when I saw this image, the street, the Christmas decoration, the traffic, all the cars heading somewhere home, and when I heard Holly Cole, the great, reliable Holly Cole, always good for a Song of the Day, sing "<a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/thischristmas/illbehomeforchristmas.htm" target="_blank">I'll Be Home For Christmas</a>", then I knew this can't be wrong, can it?<br/><br/>The song is from her 2001 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Cold-Outside-Holly-Cole/dp/B000VAQX50" target="_blank">Baby, It's Cold Outside</a>". Not your typical Christmas album.
