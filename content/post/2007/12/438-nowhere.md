I went into the garden, took an image of the crooked old fence that runs down the hill, and then went to bed again.<br/><br/>Sigma 70/2.8 at f2.8, 1/50s and ISO 500, post-processing with Photoshop.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071225_135312_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071225_135312_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> In the early afternoon, when the fog had cleared up, I took the car and drove around to take some more shots. I am still abusing the Sigma 70/2.8 macro and try to find out what it can do for me.<br/><br/>This second image is another landscape, and like yesterday's it is based on a flat S-curve, emphasized by the compression of the telephoto lens. This time it is f8 at 1/400s and ISO 200.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Nowhere" from the 1992 Giant Sand album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ramp-Giant-Sand/dp/B000003BIO" target="_blank">Ramp</a>". No lyrics, sorry.
