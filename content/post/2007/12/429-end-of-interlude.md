In the evening we were invited to a Christmas party near Klagenfurt, but upon arriving there, we decided to turn around and drive home again. It had begun to snow a little, and as we live on a hill, I was afraid that we would have problems getting up there.<br/><br/>And so it was. We took an alternative way that is not so steep, but even then I just managed to get the car and us safely home. Half an hour more and it would have been too late.<br/><br/>Today it was all white and gloomy. I worked on yesterday's images and stayed at home. Shortly after sundown I finally went into the garden to shoot this image. It is the JPEG right out of the camera. Nikon 18-200 at 18mm, f11, ISO 200 and 30s, taken with mirror lockup and VR de-activated for maximum sharpness.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is Bob Dylan's "<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/winterlude.html" target="_blank">Winterlude</a>" from the 1970 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Morning-Bob-Dylan/dp/B0000024WJ" target="_blank">New Morning</a>". Boy, do I love it when he sings ðŸ™‚
