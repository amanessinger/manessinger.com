Can you see the noise?<br/><br/>For me, the most important reason to buy the D300 and to replace my trusty D200 now and not in weeks or months, was the supposed low-light performance. You see, I work all day and, at this time of the year, regardless of how the weather is, when I leave work and begin to have time for photography, it is dark. OK, when you browse through the images of last winter, you will see that I was not exactly unproductive, but having some options more, is never a bad thing.<br/><br/>Click on the image. I guess you still can't see any noise, and I can't, even when I look at the image on the whole height of my screen, at 1200 pixels. Ain't there any noise?<br/><br/>There is, and it is quite prominent in a 100% crop.<br/><br/>I really like this noise. It is nice noise. No color blotches, only grain. I have yet to print one of these images (my printer is in Vienna and I am in Carinthia now), but I guess it will come out quite fine.<br/><br/>At the moment I have "ISO Sensitivity Automatic Control" (the good old Auto ISO) set to go up to 6400, but I think I'll change that. 6400 is OK for documentary purposes and for certain situations when you want to use noise creatively, as a general purpose setting it is too high. I would need a D3 for that, but maybe in 18 months the D400 will do as well.<br/><br/>This was it for today. Stay tuned, the story goes on.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "When Lights Are Low" from Roberta Gambarini's last album "You Are There".
