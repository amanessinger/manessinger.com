There is nothing relevant to tell about the D300 right now, as I had only very limited time for shooting. I was all busy refactoring a big piece of Perl code, to make it do something that it was never designed to do. Tedious and boring, and obviously it wore down my creativity as well. I have only some crooked compositions that went wrong for various reasons - and this. Not the most inventive of images but, hey, what do you expect on such a day?<br/><br/>Sigma 20/1.8 at f1.8. May it suffice ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Boredom" from the 1967 Lovin' Spoonful album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Playing-Lovin-Spoonful/dp/B0000894P3" target="_blank">Everything Playing</a>".
