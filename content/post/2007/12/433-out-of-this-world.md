Instead I use it as walk-around lens. It's already late today, I have little more than three hours of sleep if I can keep this short, so let's get on to some images of today.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071220_083452_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071220_083452_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> This Tweety actually wears a Santa Claus cap, I should have included it, but I forgot. The figurine is part of a signal horn mounted on an old bicycle that is parked at the corner <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=albertgasse&sll=48.209206,16.372778&sspn=0.366528,0.902252&ie=UTF8&ll=48.208759,16.343601&spn=0.005727,0.014098&z=17&om=1" target="_blank">Albertgasse/Pfeilgasse</a> most of the time.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071220_162033_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071220_162033_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The second image is an architecture shot of a passage way that I have shot more than once now. It is from only 4:20pm, but Auto ISO had already gone to 3200 to sustain 1/60s, and that's at f2.8! OK, that's for walking around with an un-stabilized telephoto lens ðŸ™‚ I really like the low-to-high perspective though.<br/><br/>The Image of the Day is another example for the abstracting power of this lens. It was again shot at f2.8 and shown part of a traffic sign, another round traffic sign in the background and some lights that I can't identify. The red light could be from a semaphore, the others - I really don't know, windows in a house front perhaps.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Out Of This World" from Edwyn Collins' 1994 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gorgeous-George-Edwyn-Collins/dp/B0000048EA" target="_blank">Gorgeous George</a>".
