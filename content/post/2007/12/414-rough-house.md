Well, maybe one: it does not make me more creative ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Today I've had stress in the morning and could not take opportunity of the wonderful morning light that we had, and later I was on a trip down into Slovenia. Many interesting things and places, but I was not alone, and that always takes away from my creativity. I made lots of uninspired, documentary images, but nothing that I'd bother you with.<br/><br/>This one is an architectural detail from a house in Villach. I shot it out of the car while waiting for the bar in a backyard entrance to open. Nikon 18-200 at 60mm, f8 and 1/20s, post-processing in Capture NX.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "Rough House Blues" by Fletcher Henderson, a recording from 1927 that I have on disc 18 of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>". Sorry, I've found no sound sample.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing: I've dumped the <a href="http://www.blogrush.com/r85849021" target="_blank">BlogRush</a> widget. It may have worked for some people who came in very early, but it did not for me. For the whole time I had it, there were less than ten visitors who came here due to their syndication. This is not worth the space.<br/><br/>Basically BlogRush is a pyramid game. You can't lose anything but space in this game, but when you're too late, you can't win anything either. I have replaced it with a "News" section in the sidebar.
