Oh well, but it has a charm of its own ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Nikon 18-200 at 200mm, f9, 1/30s and ISO 3200.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/sting/moon+over+bourbon+street_20132085.html" target="_blank">Moon Over Bourbon Street</a>". I have it on Sting's live album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bring-Night-Sting/dp/B0007X6ST2" target="_blank">Bring on the Night</a>". The studio version is up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bubtZO-wmEg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, cleverly combined with scenes from "Interview With A Vampire" (or was it really on the soundtrack?).
