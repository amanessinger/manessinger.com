Already being there, I decided to take home some food from our favorite Chinese restaurant, and while I had to wait there for a few minutes, I took this image of a horse figurine. <br/><br/>Sigma 70/2.8 macro at f2.8, 1/50s and ISO 500. I guess that is my first shot with this lens that qualifies as macro ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/echo-the-bunnymen-bring-on-the-dancing-horses-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Bring On The Dancing Horses</a>" by Echo &amp; The Bunnymen. It's from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Learn-Sing-Echo-Bunnymen/dp/B000002L8T" target="_blank">Songs to Learn and Sing</a>", the only one of their albums that I have.
