Biologically he may not be our son, but I guess that mostly ends the difference. He is in Vienna at the moment, an aspiring young man with a university degree in law, speaking more languages than I can think of, searching for a job in a publishing house. Got one? Drop me a line please ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Tonight we were out for dinner at "<a href="http://www.sestante.at/" target="_blank">Il Sestante</a>", a wonderful Italian restaurant at the heart of Vienna's 8<sup>th</sup> district. You can eat fine pizza there, but tonight it was fish soup. It is easily the best fish soup in town and I always eat fish soup there. Try it for yourself, you won't regret it.<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071212_200141_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071212_200141_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> Actually it was all fish tonight, even the lights were fishy. Is this a nice, happy guy or what?<br/><br/>Both images were shot with the Nikon 18-200, Michael at 18mm, f3.5, 1/30s and ISO 2500, the fish at 18mm, f3.5, 1/80s and ISO 200. Post-processing in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once again from the soundtrack to Alan Parker's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Commitments-Michael-Aherne/dp/6305622922" target="_blank">The Commitments</a>". This time it is "<a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/the-commitments-too-many-fish-in-the-sea-lyrics.html" target="_blank">Too Many Fish In The Sea</a>" from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Commitments-Vol-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000002OJD" target="_blank">second album</a>. Never seen the movie? What a shame!
