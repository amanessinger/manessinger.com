Sorry, in the evening we were out for dinner and when we finally came home, I was much too tired to even decide about the image to use.<br/><br/>Saint George's Church in Sternberg stands on a rock, 733 meters above sea level, and in our vicinity it is easily the most sunny place. Yesterday I was a tad late for shooting, and consequently I drove up to Sternberg for some last rays. This is what the church looks like from the parking area, seen through my Sigma 70/2.8. Shooting big architecture through a short tele is not exactly easy ðŸ™‚<br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071229_155521_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071229_155521_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;"/></a> On the other hand, this is a fantastic portrait lens, and hanging on the southern wall of Saint George's is a fantastic portrait of the suffering Christ. Another good use for a major diagonal. <br/><br/><a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20071229_155614_ps.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2007/20071229_155614_ps.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;"/></a> The last image that I want to share is of the church's entrance door. Wonderfully weathered old wood, painted in warm tones, bathed in the last rays of the sun.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Song of the Day was "<a href="http://thuvia.org/edwyn/george.html" target="_blank">Gorgeous George</a>" from Edwyn Collins' 1994 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gorgeous-George-Edwyn-Collins/dp/B000025U7E" target="_blank">Gorgeous George</a>".
