I took it when I arrived in Vienna. It's from 0:28am, so I guess it can be considered being from Monday. It's again taken with the 50/1.2 at f1.2, and again it is shallow depth-of-field, but this time I wanted to create the spooky effect of not being able to clearly see where one's way leads. It's a little bit like being short-sighted and having lost one's glasses. To me it actually feels a little disturbing, but that may be because I am very short-sighted ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>No post-processing, only a tiny crop from the left.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/steve+harley/the+mad+mad+moonlight_20130769.html" target="_blank">Mad, Mad Moonlight</a>" by Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel from their 1975 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Years-Our-Lives/dp/B0000070QW" target="_blank">The Best Years of Our Lives</a>".
