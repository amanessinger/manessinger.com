It was drab but it didn't rain yet. I saw this Vespa in Neubaugasse and took the photo with the Sigma 30/1.4 at f2.8, trying to fill the frame and getting no mergers. RAW conversion was done in Capture NX, post-processing in Photoshop. I did quite some cleanup on the ground, adjusted contrast in fore- and background very differently and desaturated the far background with the other side of the street.<br/><br/>Searching my music library for files with "scooter" or "motorcycle" in the name turned out embarrassingly fruitless, so I looked for "ride" and found Madonna's "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/madonna/easy+ride_20086824.html" target="_blank">Easy Ride</a>" from her 2003 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Life-Madonna/dp/B00008S2VG" target="_blank">American Life</a>". <br/><br/>I learned to love Madonna when I first saw the video of "Take a Bow" from "Bedtime Stories", easily the best and most breathtaking music video I've ever seen (OK, I don't see so many of them these days, but around that time I did), and from then on I've bought all of her albums. She is really the star who has freed herself from the tight corset of her fan's expectations, constantly reinventing herself. Each album is something new, something different, and "American Life" probably a bit more of that.<br/><br/>Is it that? Is that the Song of the Day? Uhh ... no, of course not. "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/doors/easy+ride_20042719.html" target="_blank">Easy Ride</a>" from The Doors' frequently underrated 1969 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Parade-Doors/dp/B000MG1ZFQ" target="_blank">The Soft Parade</a>" is the Song of the Day. Same title, very different feeling. Not so much a better song but a better match. Now, that's it. See you tomorrow.
