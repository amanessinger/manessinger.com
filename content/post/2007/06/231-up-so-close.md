We work together and he is one of those guys constantly perstered by me and my camera. He's a nice guy and he endures it stoically. This is another image with the Nikon 50/1.2 at f1.2, this time from very near. I have focused on the area below the left eye, and see how out of focus his nose already is. Post-processing was done in Capture NX and was mostly concerned with color temperature and control of contrast.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cake/up+so+close_20026672.html" target="_blank">Up So Close</a>" from Cake's 1994 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Motorcade-Generosity-Cake/dp/B00005ABIE" target="_blank">Motorcade of Generosity</a>".
