This image is from Saturday. It was a rainy day and when the evening came, I decided, instead of making big pictures of tiny flowers I could probably drive to Klagenfurt and look for some evening color. Really, it stopped raining and I could take quite a number of images, all using the Nikon 50/1.2 at f1.2.<br/><br/>Originally I had planned to go for shallow depth-of-field, but in the end I made mostly normal scenics. Still, it really is a pleasure in the night to shoot handheld at 1/60s and to easily stay in bearable ISO ranges. Post-processing was done in Capture NX.<br/><br/>This is "Alter Platz", a pedestrian zone in the center of Klagenfurt.<br/><br/>The Song of Saturday was "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/randy+crawford/rainy+night+in+georiga_20309073.html" target="_blank">Rainy Night In Georgia</a>" from Randy Crawfords 1981 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Combination-Randy-Crawford/dp/B000002KM8" target="_blank">Secret Combination</a>".
