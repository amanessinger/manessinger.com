Oh well, this is from before swimming, when it was hot. We had a tropical day and this is a tropical image.<br/><br/>Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, post-processing in Photoshop with all sorts of tricks, two versions from RAW layered, cloning, Lab color manipulations, local contrast and saturation adjustments, vignettes, you name it. Not exactly a great image, not even after all that effort, but I have nothing better. Sorry ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I have never been a Santana fan. I mean, of course I have some of his classics, but none of them really are my favorites, except one of his more controversial works, the 1983 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Havana-Moon-Carlos-Santana/dp/B0000025UR" target="_blank">Havana Moon</a>". Boy, do I love this, and, would the fan say, for all the wrong reasons. This is dance music, and the Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/santana/vereda+tropical_20121404.html" target="_blank">Vereda Tropical</a>", the most controversial song on the album, is my favorite track. Have you ever danced to "Vereda Tropical"? Well, probably you should. <br/><br/>My second favorite on this album is "They All Went To Mexico", of course. Willie Nelson's Spanish is almost as abysmal as Bob Dylan's ðŸ™‚
