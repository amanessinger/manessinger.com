Are that wonderful lyrics or what?<br/><br/>I took this photo yesterday evening. Days are long now and this is from 9:20pm. I had already had some wine, didn't want to drive elsewhere and was still in need of an Image of the Day. I took my tripod, two Lee ND gradient filters (I got a set of them yesterday), went into the garden and shot this image with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and f11. Exposure was for seven seconds, that's what makes the blur on the tree to the left. Afterwards, in Photoshop, I have cloned out some distractions and warmed the image up a little.<br/><br/>Using filters is tedious, but I'll try that more often now. Let's wait and see what I do with what I've got now ðŸ™‚
