It's from the same place in  <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&amp;q=ahorner+gasse&layer=&amp;sll=48.220001,16.37&sspn=0.111171,0.21183&amp;ie=UTF8&z=17&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Ahornergasse</a> where in April I was "<a href="/2007/04/179-sitting-in-sun-drinking-beer.html" target="_blank">179 - Sitting in the Sun, Drinking a Beer</a>". Tuesday I had started using the 150/2.8 as a walkaround lens and Wednesday I was still at it. It's actually a funny thing. Sure, 150mm is not a very convenient focal length to say the least, but on the other hand it forces you to see what you have never seen, or otherwise simply to be very creative. Post-processing was again done in Capture NX.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of the Eurythmics, at least not at their time, but I learned to love Annie Lennox with her 1995 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Medusa-Annie-Lennox/dp/B000002VUC" target="_blank">Medusa</a>". From that album is today's Song of the day, "<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/annielennox/thethinlinebetweenloveandhate.html" target="_blank">The Thin Line Between Love And Hate</a>".
