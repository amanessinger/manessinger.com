Every place where people live is. It's really fantastic. You stroll through these cities and there is one image after the other, an endless stream of possibilities. I mean, it's no big deal to live in the city and make good images at times. The opportunities come from all by themselves. You simply have to be attentive and patient.<br/><br/>The problem begins when you have a daily photoblog and the opportunities sometimes decide to not come. Just like today. I had some images, but nothing convincing. At such times it has been found to be a good strategy to move your ass. Today was Ass Moving Day.<br/><br/>Weather had been dull all day, but I really had the feeling that it could probably clear up in the evening or, better, there could be clouds but not too many, just the right ones for a spectacular sundown. Therefore I was prepared when at 8:20 I saw the sun come out. I took my slingshot and the tripod and headed for the Underground. I was really lucky. It took me less than 20 minutes on two trains to reach <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.227646,16.409969&amp;spn=0.011722,0.028195&z=16&amp;om=1" target="_blank">Donauinsel</a> and begin shooting.<br/><br/>I used the Sigma 10-20, mostly at 10mm, together with an 0.9 and an 0.6 ND gradient filter, shot for about half an hour, and this was it.<br/><br/>This is my favorite image from that set. I have post-processed it in Capture NX. Nothing fancy, only some minor adjustments.<br/><br/>We had Willy DeVille two times yet. Today's Song of the Day is from his album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Live-Berlin-Willy-DeVille/dp/samples/B000089IZH/ref=dp_tracks_all_1" target="_blank">Live in Berlin</a>". It's called "<a href="http://www.lyricshornet.com/829731/Willy-DeVille-You-Better-Move-On-Lyrics" target="_blank">You Better Move On</a>".
