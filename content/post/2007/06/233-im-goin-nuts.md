I was sleepy all day and completely unmotivated to drive around for photographing. I didn't want to shoot flowers either, thus I arranged some nuts, went near, tried a couple of different perspectives, different arrangements and different apertures. This is what satisfied me. Post-processing again with Capture NX.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is once again from this 42 disc collection called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Jazz-Archive-Various-Artists/dp/B000B7I3W4" target="_blank">The Ultimate Jazz Archive</a>". It's "Hot Nuts" by the Washboard Rhythm Kings and it's from 1933. Quite some time ago ðŸ™‚
