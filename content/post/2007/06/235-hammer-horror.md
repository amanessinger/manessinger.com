It's simply not reasonable to expect people to come back after having seen no updates for six days, is it? Well, I won't stop blogging, therefore I'll honestly try to keep my dates with you.<br/><br/>This is an image from (blush) Tuesday morning. In the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century there was an industry that produced lots of these figures for all the houses that were built all over Vienna, then the center of a mighty empire and a rapidly expanding city. So, this was not high art, it was mass-produced decoration, and the motif was normally related to the profession of the principal. I have tried to find out what the combination of hammer and vase means, but unfortunately to no avail, so you'll have to settle with the image.<br/><br/>I shot the image with the Sigma 150/2.8 at f2.8, actually a macro lens, but since my Nikon 18-200 is still being repaired, it has to second as telephoto lens. Post-processing was done in Capture NX.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/k/kate+bush/hammer+horror_20077186.html" target="_blank">Hammer Horror</a>" from the most wonderful Kate Bush's 1990 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lionheart-Kate-Bush/dp/B000007MVL" target="_blank">Lionheart</a>". Kate Bush is a phenomenon. I can't really recommend one of her albums, because all of them are so incredibly good, there is no way but having them all. This is a little bit like movies by Stanley Kubrick. One couldn't possibly single out a "best" of them either.
