<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070607_113608_nx_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070607_113608_nx_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Thursday was the Feast of Corpus Christi, one of the more important catholic holidays, and because Austria is a very catholic country, I had a day off from work. I took a car and made a trip into the beautiful environs of Vienna, to get some sun, swimming and, of course, for taking photographs.<br/><br/>This image was taken with my beloved Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, fitted with a polarizer, and I took it in the brightest light of the day. I confess, it didn't look that good when I was there, and the JPEG right out of the camera didn't look good either. Making it look as it does took me about 10 minutes in Capture NX and maybe 10 minutes more in Photoshop to clone out some minor distractions.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "In The Fields" from Sara Hickman's 1990 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shortstop-Sara-Hickman/dp/B000002H8H" target="_blank">Shortstop</a>". There seem to be no lyrics available on the net. <br/><br/>I have only two of Sara Hickman's albums, this one and "Equal Scary People", but I like what I have and she seems to have been quite productive over the years. Her last album is from 2006, I guess I'll have to do some research ðŸ™‚
