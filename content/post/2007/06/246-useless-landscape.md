Oh well. <br/><br/>This is one I like. I took it (and most others) with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm and a polarizer. Light was extremely problematic this morning. We had rain during the night and the sun was very bright. I was around much too late and at 10:30 the light was as harsh as you can get it. The polarizer helps a little, and in Capture NX I did my share, so I guess the result is bearable.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://lyrics.lr2.com/T/Tom+Jobim/Useless+landscape/703803.html" target="_blank">Useless Landscape</a>" ("Inutil Paisagem") is a Bossa Nova by Antonio Carlos Jobim and I have it in an intriguingly dense version from the great Betty Carter's 1996 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yours-Youre-Mine-Betty-Carter/dp/B00000474Z" target="_blank">I'm Yours, You're Mine</a>". Betty Carter's rendition is as different as it gets from what in 1969 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAZQXUCsndE" target="_blank">Ella Fitzgerald</a> did in Montreux, but that's Jazz and that's why I like it.
