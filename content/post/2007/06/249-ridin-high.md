<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070619_162408_nx.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070619_162408_nx.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>The windows of our office get cleaned these days, and when today I left from work, seeing these two people dangling high above me, I asked them if I could take a picture. They agreed, I took three images, this one, a second, and one that I discarded later. Afterwards, a guy who had seen me asked for the photos, one of the workers up there was his girlfriend and he had forgotten to bring along a camera.<br/><br/>Both images were run through Capture NX without major modifications. I have corrected exposure, adjusted contrasts, and for this one I have set three color control points, two for the reflection of the sky and one to warm up the reflected facade. Then I have cropped both, to let some lines come exactly out of the corners. Normally I try to do that in-camera (Ted calls me a control-freak for that), this time I had been inexcusably sloppy ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>We had Ella Fitzgerald three days ago, we had Cole Porter yesterday, but - sorry, I can't help it - the Song of the Day is Ella Fitzgerald's rendition of "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/ella+fitzgerald/ridin+high_20045872.html" target="_blank">Ridinâ€™ High</a>" from "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ella-Fitzgerald-Sings-Porter-Songbook/dp/B0000047EG" target="_blank">The Cole Porter Songbook</a>". Let's be honest: this is a very tame Ella, and still, Goodness, was this woman a singer! And Cole Porter? Well, he is as he ever is. You may hate Jazz, you may hate musicals, you may hate the Great American Songbooks, but all this won't be an excuse for not loving Cole Porter at least for the most crazy lyrics ever. Not in this case, but we'll get back to the point.
