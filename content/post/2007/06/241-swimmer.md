<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070611_194804_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070611_194804_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Have I ever mentioned <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.227932,16.429667&spn=0.0233,0.056391&z=15&om=1" target="_blank">Gänsehäufel</a>? It is an island in a former part of river Danube that was left over when they regulated the river. The island is the biggest bath in Vienna, and it's a wonderful place. It is so big, that even on hot days it is never unbearably crowded. Much less so yesterday. Weather was fine, although a little dull. The bath closes at 8pm, but even at 7:30 it was almost empty. At the same time the evening light became warm and clear, and I shot a series of images of one of the pools, the one with the wave machine. I was really fascinated by the reflections of warm sunlight on ripples of water. This is something that gets almost hypnotic when you look at it and let yourself fall.<br/><br/>Don't ask me about the composition. It is so absolutely against all rules, but it somehow feels perfectly right to me. I have rotated the image by a very small angle, cropped it slightly and cloned out some minor distractions, all this in Photoshop. The image was shot with the Nikon 50/1.8 at f8 and 1/125s. The sign with the arrow in the background means "swimmer". Well, don't believe it. It's a lie. There was no swimmer to the right. Honestly.<br/><br/>The Song of the Day is "The Swimming Song" from Eddi Reader's 1992 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mirmama-Eddi-Reader/dp/B00000203C" target="_blank">Mirmama</a>". You don't know Eddi Reader? She was the singer of the fantastic group Fairground Attraction, that unfortunately didn't last longer than a single album, but this album was absolutely stellar. We'll certainly come back to it. Eddi has since had quite a respectable solo career, and this album was the beginning.
