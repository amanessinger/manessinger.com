On my way to Keutschacher See for some swimming I made a slight detour to <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=46.547764,14.076405&spn=0.096219,0.225563&z=13&om=1" target="_blank">Selkach</a>. The narrow bridge over the storage lake of river Drau was completely rebuilt last year. It's metal construction is brightly yellow, but being in the shade and indirectly lit by the water below, made it ghastly yellow-green, the color of slime, and I had the strong urge to go B&amp;W. Well, here it is, one of my more complex conversions, done in Photoshop. It could have been done in less than 17 layers, but that's what it has. I guess I like it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>There can be no doubt that "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/s/simon+and+garfunkel/bridge+over+troubled+water_20124580.html" target="_blank">Bridge Over Troubled Water</a>" is the Song of the Day, and of course I had the album as LP, but interestingly enough I currently don't have it by Simon &amp; Garfunkel at all, but I have it by Roberta Flack on her 1971 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Fire-Roberta-Flack/dp/B000002I64" target="_blank">Quiet Fire</a>".
