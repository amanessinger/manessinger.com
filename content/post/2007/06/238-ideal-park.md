It is the very place where in winter we saw hooded people  "<a href="/2007/01/83-dancing-in-blindness.html" target="_blank">83 - Dancing in Blindness</a>", dancing in frenzy during "<a href="/2007/01/103-le-sacre-dhiver.html" target="_blank">103 - Le sacre d'hiver</a>". Now, in Summer, all mystery is gone and it is simply <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&amp;z=16&ll=48.207694,16.360713&amp;spn=0.01277,0.016136" target="_blank">Volksgarten</a>, Vienna's most beautiful rose garden.<br/><br/>Sometimes at noon, when the weather is right, I take a break from work and go there, taking photographs of people taking photographs of photographing people. There is a certain Escher feeling to it. This park is obviously on any tourist group's list, and still it has a certain quietude.

What he imagines is far more exotic, but actually I think thousands of roses, a baroque fountain and Burgtheater in the background are not too shabby either.
