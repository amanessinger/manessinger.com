I shot it in the morning, the rest of the day was so-so, and it culminated in the worst storm of this year, two people in Vienna died.<br/><br/>This is another image that I've post-processed in Photoshop. The original had almost no colors, no contrast, what there was was rust and dust, all gray, orange and brown, but I knew I could make something out of nothing here. In Lab I applied first a de-saturation layer, then a "Man from Mars" and finally a saturation layer. VoilÃ , here are the colors. I love that Old Black Magic ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/e/ella+fitzgerald/that+old+black+magic_20045650.html" target="_blank">That Old Black Magic</a>" is also the Song of the Day. Again it is Ella Fitzgerald, this time live on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ella-Rome-Birthday-Concert-Fitzgerald/dp/B00000477L" target="_blank">Ella in Rome: The Birthday Concert</a>". Wonderful version that is.
