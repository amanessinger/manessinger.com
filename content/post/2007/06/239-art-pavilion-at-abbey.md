The structure in the background, the Juraj Å porer pavilion, was originally a cafÃ© and now serves as an art pavilion.<br/><br/>On Saturday I've been there, only three hours from home but indeed for the first time in my life. I can tell you, communism is gone as if it never had been there, and it's glamorous again.<br/><br/>Opatija is a paradise for photographers. Of course this image was shot with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm, f11, 1/60s, with a polarizer.<br/><br/>"<a href="http://www.absolutelyrics.com/lyrics/view/morrissey/to_me_you_are_a_work_of_art/" target="_blank">To Me You Are A Work Of Art</a>" by Morrissey is the Song of the Day. "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ringleader-Tormentors-Morrissey/dp/B000E3LFZC" target="_blank">Ringleader Of The Tormentors</a>" may not be his best solo album, but this song is undeniably great. Hmm ... Morrissey ... you either love or hate him. Guess on which side I am ðŸ™‚
