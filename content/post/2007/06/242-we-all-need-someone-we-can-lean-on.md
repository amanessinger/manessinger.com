<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2007/20070612_080347_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2007/20070612_080347_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>Here we are with another one of my bicycle portraits. Hey, this is the first time in weeks that I could manage to get the Image of the Day posted and blogged the very same day that it was shot. Feels good.<br/><br/>I shot this image in the morning in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=48.208974,16.345124&spn=0.005827,0.010632&z=17&om=1" target="_blank">Lerchengasse</a> on my way to work. I have cloned out a very distracting window in the background, made some selective adjustments to saturation, but otherwise ... only kiddin'. Of course this image is heavily edited and that is as it has to be ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It's again the Nikon 50/1.8 at f1.8, post-processing was done in Photoshop.<br/><br/>The title is a line from one of the very greatest songs in Rock history. It's the Rolling Stones with "<a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/rolling+stones/let+it+bleed_20117892.html" target="_blank">Let it Bleed</a>", a song from their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Let-Bleed-DSD-Rolling-Stones/dp/B00006AW2G" target="_blank">1969 album</a> of the same name.
