I knew I didn't have much time, ran, fetched the camera, found the contrast impossible to cope with, ran again, fetched the tripod and, well, here we are with another HDR image from seven bracketed exposures.<br/><br/>The approach was different this time. I used two different exposures as layers and an HDR image tone-mapped with Photomatix as base, duplicated some layers and threw in some blending modes and a mask. <br/><br/>Basically, the idea was to map with Photomatix to an extremely flat image with not much light smoothing, an image that would hold maximum detail everywhere, and then use the other layers to modulate this detail base in different blending modes and opacities. There are endless possibilities and the result is somewhat random. Effectively I used what finally looked good.<br/><br/>I had not known Lambchop until last fall when I saw them in Vienna's "Konzerthaus". Well, I guess you have arrived at respectability once you play there ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsdir.com/lambchop-the-new-cobweb-summer-lyrics.html" target="_blank">The New Cobweb Summer</a>" is from their 2002 album "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Woman-Lambchop/dp/B00005Y1UG" target="_blank">Is A Woman</a>".
