Here's one image of a lone magpie resting on a tree across the street. Thursday morning it sat there long enough for me to take several images. 

No images were taken on Saturday though. I was busy buying a new washing machine, installing it and getting rid of the defective old one ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is not exactly a song at all. It's the overture to Gioachino Rossini's opera "La Gazza Ladra", famously used by Stanley Kubrick in "A Clockwork Orange". If violence disturbs you, I suggest you'd better avoid the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v90KPJ6n4Ew" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAB0WzTnMl4" target="_blank">scenes</a> from the movie where it was used so brilliantly.
