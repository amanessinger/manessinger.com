Thankfully there's no need to fall back to Saturday's pictures. I saw these guys talking today when I went to work. I didn't want to disturb, so I have no idea what the buzz was about. It seems to have been important though ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "It's The Talk Of The Town" by Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Getz. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g67P-uX2N8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
