I've made many images this morning, but almost all of them are of my new apartment. So far the floor panels are still missing, the walls are white instead of being painted in three colors, and of course it is totally empty. I've got keys though ðŸ™‚

 The Image of the Day is of the entrance to a restaurant. I passed by on my way back to work.

The Song of the Day is "Mosaique" from the 1989 Gipsy Kings album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWzvs9LcC8U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
