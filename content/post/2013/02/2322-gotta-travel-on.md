Due to the masses of snow I decided to call the taxi a little earlier, just to make sure that I don't miss the train. It was no problem though, the ride took me exactly as short as always, therefore I had to wait a bit longer at the station.

 I had not expected to make any images today, but while I waited, I thought I could as well take out the camera. This ice-crusted train window is what I got.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/gotta_travel_on.html" target="_blank">Gotta Travel On</a>" from Dylan's "Self Portrait". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RhYAl5BI90" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
