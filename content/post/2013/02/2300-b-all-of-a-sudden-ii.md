This image was taken yesterday around noon. I did like the image of the cars in beginning snowfall well enough to want to make it an Image of the Day, but of course this one also deserves a post of its own ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is still "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bette_midler/all_of_a_sudden.html" target="_blank">All Of A Sudden</a>" from Bette Midler's 1990 album "Some People's Lives". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pJHzX7LzjQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
