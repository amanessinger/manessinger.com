I'm on the train from Carinthia back to Vienna. No images were taken today, but yesterday provided me with enough stuff to make it through the week. Let's hope it doesn't come to that though ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/robbie_williams/me_and_my_shadow.html" target="_blank">Me And My Shadow</a>" from Robbie Williams' 2003 album "Swing When You're Winning". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YsHX65vvlo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
