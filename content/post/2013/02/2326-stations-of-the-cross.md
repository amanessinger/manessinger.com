In the afternoon it was sunny, but at that time I was already working. Not so in the morning though. I shortly considered the option to despair and just use an old image again, but then I refused. Fog and snow do not have to be entirely dull ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/stations_of_the_cross.html" target="_blank">Stations Of The Cross</a>" from Elvis Costello's 2010 album "National Ransom". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wVsCrZPd3U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
