This is most probably not my best image, but it is an image taken today, posted today. Boy, has that become rare!

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/jethro_tull/look_at_the_animals.html" target="_blank">Look At The Animals</a>" from the Jethro Tull collection "Nightcap - The Unreleased Masters 1973-1991". Even second rate Tull stuff is first rate by everybody else's standards. But, OK, I admit: I'm a fan ðŸ˜„
