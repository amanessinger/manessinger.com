OK, I knew it, here we are, back to Saturday's images. Today was a debugging nightmare, and although I came out of it victorious, I am completely spent. I made a few images on my way from work to the train, but frankly I am too tired to even import them into Lightroom ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Down Here Below" from Steve Earle's 2007 album "Washington Square Serenade". <a href="http://blabirch.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bill Birtch</a> once brought me to Earle's music, thanks once again for that, Bill.

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAmdOPCPu3A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
