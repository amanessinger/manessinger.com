Sunday morning I thought it would be fine to sleep a little longer, but when I saw the fine weather outside, I rose early nevertheless. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130210_095103_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130210_095103_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I took the car and drove to OberschÃ¼tt, a small village south of mount Dobratsch, situated on the north side of river Gail.

It was cold, around -10 degrees Celsius, a sunny day, and I intended to walk a forest road along and then down to the river. When I left the car I changed my shoes for classic seventies style moon boots and I put on my <a href="http://www.roeckl.de/en/products/multisport-outdoor/multisport-outdoor/glove/karun/" target="_blank">Roeckl Karun gloves</a>. You may remember, I've written about them last year, and I am glad to say that I can fully operate the OM-D with the gloves on, even in their mitten form. That's cool, or rather, that's warm and it keeps me photographing even in bitingly cold weather.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130210_090410_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130210_090410_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I had one tiny problem though. The rocks along the river were covered in deep snow, and minutes after I had arrived at the shore, my right foot got stuck between two stones. I pulled it out easily, but the boot still stuck, and there I stood with my right foot in socks, standing in the snow.

After I had recovered the boot, the socks were already wet. I asked myself weather to worry about that and to immediately return to the car, or to just put the boot back on without socks and keep photographing.

 The latter I did. It was not even cold. Some snow crystals had found their way into the boot, but the thick insulation kept me warm enough that I could have gone on forever.
