The weather report had promised snowfall in the morning and occasional sunshine in the afternoon. Well, the sunshine was much less than occasional, I'd say. This is a typical view from our terrace like we had it all day. Only now after sunset (Sun? What sun??) has it stopped snowing.

 The Song of the Day is "Snowfall" from the 1992 Manhattan Transfer "Christmas Album". I may have used it a few times, but never did it fit so well. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaxTMpMogMk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
