We had a bleak day with occasional snow here in Carinthia. Definitely nothing worth photographing and not photographing is what I did ðŸ™‚

 Here's an old image, more than two years old, one of the first taken with the Panasonic LX5. I was on my way from home to work, a way that I won't go any more in only a month. From then on I will live in a completely different part of Vienna, far away, less beautiful, less photogenic, but only two minutes away from the future location of my office. I had the choice of moving or spending almost two hours per day commuting. Well, I'm moving ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/goin_away_baby.html" target="_blank">Goin' Away Baby</a>" from Eric Clapton's 1994 album "From The Cradle". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBV6YWxJrQU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
