When I arrived in Vienna late Sunday night, the fine weather was over though, and Monday was a gray, dull day with occasional snowfall and not a single ray of sun.

 This seventies mini bike caught my attention when I went to the Underground station.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/chris_de_burgh/just_another_poor_boy.html" target="_blank">Just Another Poor Boy</a>" from Chris De Burgh's 1975 album "Spanish Train &amp; Other Stories". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlNA9ADMK_Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
