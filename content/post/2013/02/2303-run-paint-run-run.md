Yesterday I missed a spectacular sunrise, but then it was gray and dull the whole day. Funnily enough, after all that grayness and dullness, I missed a spectacular sunset as well ðŸ˜„

 No problem, I decided to try my luck at night with some city lights instead. So I did, but I quickly recognized that it was not my day. It was nothing but cold and wet and a complete waste of time. Here is an image from Vienna instead. At least it has a composition ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Run Paint Run Run" from Captain Beefheart's 1980 album "Doc At The Radar Station". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGmgE0hlEI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
