After all that snow, how do you feel about some green? Villach has it all. At the base of Mount Dobratsch is the source of a small, warm creek. You wouldn't recognize it in summer, but in winter the contrast between the white snow and the green algae in the water is stunning.

 OK, it's not a river, but still, the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/creedence_clearwater_revival/green_river.html" target="_blank">Green River</a>" from the 1969 Creedence Clearwater Revival album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw0hI-ZrHVg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
