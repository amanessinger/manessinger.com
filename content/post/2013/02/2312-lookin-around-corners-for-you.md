I don't take many images in the moment. Thursday it was only one, and I still have not even imported it into Lightroom. Maybe I should ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Lookin' Around Corners for You" by Tommy Dorsey. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRDmDyzVsL8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
