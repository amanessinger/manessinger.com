Sunday earned its name. It was mostly sunny and I drove up towards a mountain pass to get even more of the white splendor.

I took photos for around an hour and came home with the good feeling of having a bunch of safe bets. Imagine my horror when I began to process them and found that they all sucked. Each one of them.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130203_124130_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130203_124130_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> How could that be? Somehow the colors were all completely off and whatever I did, I found no way to reconstruct what I had seen. It was as if the camera had failed to record it.

Well, of course I know that cameras suck at photographing snow. They all do. The Kodak did, the D200 did, the D300 did, although in a surprisingly different way than its predecessor, the LX5 did, so what had I expected? Why shouldn't the OM-D suck at this when all others do as well?

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130203_131845_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130203_131845_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Maybe I am too spoiled by the sensationally good automatic white balance of the OM-D. Sensational that is, as long as we don't have snow. If we have, everything goes down in a sea of blue. In fact, it's not always that way, but the combination of blue sky, white snow, sunshine and harsh contrasts is brutal.

I think these three images are pretty good. They are far from perfect, they don't exactly look like it looked when I was there, but at least I think the images are believable. Why? I think it's because they are white enough. The snow is white enough. I think contrast in the snow is important, texture is important and we don't want to see the snow burn out, but at the same time snow has to look white. Not gray, not blue, certainly not yellow, no, it must be white. Almost. With just a tiny little amount of color. Just a little. Not too much, but leave it out and the whole image is dead. It's pretty hard to find the right balance and that's the reason why you see this today and not yesterday when it was shot.

 Am I satisfied with these images? Well, not really, but I've spent so much time with them, it's enough. I am snow-blind ðŸ™‚
