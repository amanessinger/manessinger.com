I was lying yesterday. I wrote about feeling a chill, but in reality it was unusually warm and all the snow in yesterday's image was rapidly melting. On the other hand, yesterday was yesterday and today is today.

It began with heavy rain in the morning, but at around 10 am snowflakes were mixed into the rain. At that time I was in a shop, buying an oven and a dishwasher for my new apartment in Vienna. I didn't stay there very long, but when I came out, the situation had changed drastically: Now it was a litte rain mixed with the snow.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bette_midler/all_of_a_sudden.html" target="_blank">All Of A Sudden</a>" from Bette Midler's 1990 album "Some People's Lives". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pJHzX7LzjQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
