OK, I've finally looked at it and it is not so bad. Here is yesterday's image, for today I really have none. The image was just taken from our terrace.

What's going on? I'm working a lot and working is a lot of fun at the moment. It won't keep me from photographing, but ... well, today it did ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is Georg Trakl's poem "Ein Winterabend" set to music by Anton Webern. It's part four of the "Four songs for soprano and orchestra, opus 13". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU-Qk1nsyKs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, in the video it starts at 4:55.
