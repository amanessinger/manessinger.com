It's Wednesday night, I'm on the train from Vienna to Carinthia now. I have taken not a single good image today, therefore you get one more of yesterday.

 Again the Song of the Day is "The Ballad Of The Fallen" by Charlie Haden, Carla Bley and lots of other good musicians. We last had it in fall 2011. The original is not on YouTube, but I found a video of another band with a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5XQhrp93b8" target="_blank">very true to the original performance.</a>
