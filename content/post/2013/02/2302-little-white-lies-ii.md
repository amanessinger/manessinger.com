This morning, in my despair about yesterday's snow images, I made an image of the snow on our roof terrace. Here it is. Perfectly natural.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130204_121915_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130204_121915_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I really had to laugh when I looked at the histogram. There was almost no contrast, the whole image is a narrow peak just below pure white.

Just for fun I looked what happened when I increased contrast by changing the black point. It was horrible and it immediately reminded me of yesterday's troubles. 

 The lesson learned? It is not the histogram that makes the image, it's what it looks like ðŸ™‚
