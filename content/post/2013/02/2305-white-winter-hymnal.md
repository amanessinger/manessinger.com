I took this image yesterday morning, right behind the house. Processing was again to 16 bit TIFF images developed in Lightroom, merged to a 32 bit TIFF in Photoshop, and then the tone mapping was again done in Lightroom. I love this process, the results are excellent, although I lose EXIF data when merging to HDR.

 This particular image was problematic because of my idiocy. I had exported from Lightroom in ProPhoto RGB and imported as sRGB. Consequently it took me some time to repair the colors ðŸ™‚
