The Olympus 40-150 mm lens is my cheapest. I already wanted to sell it but, boy am I glad that I didn't. Really, in good light there is absolutely nothing to be said against it. It's an 80-300 mm equivalent lens that weighs just 200 g. Nothing, really.

Btw, this place is Frantschach-St. Gertraud in Carinthia, a place that once was notorious for the stench of its paper mill. Oh my, time flies. It still does not smell like roses, but really, while you literally began holding your breath while driving through only 25 years ago, it is pretty tame now. In some respects there definitely is progress.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bryan_ferry/smoke_gets_in_your_eyes.html" target="_blank">Smoke Gets In Your Eyes</a>" from Bryan Ferry's 1974 album "Another Time, Another Place". I remember I've loved the song when it came out, I still do now. Best version ever ðŸ˜„
