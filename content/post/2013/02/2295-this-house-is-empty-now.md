I'm still feeling sick, and although I make images, I am far behind blogging about it. Feeling sick seems like a pretty perfect full-time job ðŸ™‚

 We've been here <a href="/2013/01/2290-its-all-going-on.html" target="_blank">a few days ago</a>, only this time it's much later, this time there are no people at all.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/burt_bacharach_elvis_costello/this_house_is_empty_now.html" target="_blank">This House Is Empty Now</a>" from the Elvis Costello / Burt Bachrach collaboration "Painted From Memory". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xID7AxShew0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
