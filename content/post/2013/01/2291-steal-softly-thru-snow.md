About the only thing that I use Photoshop these days is "Transform / Skew". I do it only rarely, but for instance this image needed it. No proper perspective correction would both give me the desired correction and rotation, and at the same time leave the corners alone. If I only had one single wish for Lightroom 5, "Transform / Skew" would be it.

 Other than that, it always makes me wonder why the most important album of The Captain is not on the market. Did I ever say that this music industry is rotten? Rotten to the bone??

The Song of the Day is "Steal Softly Thru Snow" from "Trout Mask Replica". Oh my, what a genius! Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO31kcwnvIU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
