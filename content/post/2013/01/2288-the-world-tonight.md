Well, actually last night when I arrived in Vienna. We had a little bit of rain last night, but temperatures were hardly above freezing and there are still masses of snow.

 Urban snow. It gets muddy in a few hours and everything looks a bit shabby, don't you think ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_mccartney/the_world_tonight.html" target="_blank">The World Tonight</a>" from Paul McCartney's 1997 album "Flaming Pie". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WHRQUycaTQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
