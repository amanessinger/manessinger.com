Times have changed. At the age of four I spent half days in the forest near our house. I went there together with my cousin or alone when he was in kindergarten. We climbed on trees and we built platforms and our own huts. Not all of that happened at the age of four, but even at the age of four I had a tremendous amount of freedom, and I enjoyed a world that was unique. Not made of plastic and not in standard colors. Times have changed.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/massive_attack/safefrom_harm.html" target="_blank">Safe From Harm</a>" from the 1991 Massive Attack album "Blue Lines". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpim0FdylFA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
