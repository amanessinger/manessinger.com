We had sort of sunshine today, but the sun was so much behind a veil that the light was flat and boring, with one exception: the quite unexpected sundown was breathtaking.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130110_133411_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130110_133411_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Unfortunately it was so unexpected, that I missed it almost entirely ðŸ˜„ 

Around noon I took two hours off to go to the supermarket and also to try to make some images. Because of a lack of inspiration I decided to try my luck with the church of Faak am See, a village at Faaker See, a lake south of Villach.

 It shouldn't be. The church was closed, but at least the old wooden door is interesting.

The Song of the Day is "Dark Star", an early Grateful Dead masterpiece. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrrTzh8XAgI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
