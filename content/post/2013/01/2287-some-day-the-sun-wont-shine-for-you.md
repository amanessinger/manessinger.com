Today I woke up at 7:00 am. The weather report predicted rain or snow in the afternoon, but in the morning the sky looked fairly promising. Torn clouds, still some minutes to go for sunrise, I felt this was a good chance to get out early and catch the best light that this day would possibly provide.

It shouldn't be. What you see in the Image of the Day, that is as good as it got, and even that has been massaged in Lightroom. I tried for almost 45 minutes, but when nothing happened, I gave up and drove to the baker's for breakfast.

Wow! Winter wonderland!

I quickly dressed again, took my gear, drove the car a few hundred meters, stopped to make my first image and ... no card in the camera. No problem, I always carry a second card, just for situations like this, but ... I couldn't find it!!!

 I gave up once more. The sun already began to vanish behind a veil, I was pretty sure that it would be finally gone as soon as I had fetched the card and returned.

Back home one more time, as soon as I had undressed, lo and behold, the sun! Winter wonderland!!

I decided to not follow the lure, have my breakfast and call it a day. A wise decision, because a few minutes later all the magic was finally gone.
