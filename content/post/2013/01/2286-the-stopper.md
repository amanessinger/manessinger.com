Instead of an image taken on Saturday, here's an old one. Two years ago on a pond in mid-Carinthia, a sign reminded me to stop here and not go any further. Not that I would have liked to do so ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "The Stopper" by Sonny Rollins and The Modern Jazz Quartet. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojJc8osljkQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
