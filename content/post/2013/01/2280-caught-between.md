I didn't make any photos today. Instead of taking the car back to Carinthia, leaving it there and taking the train to Vienna, I drove to Vienna directly. It's not much of a difference, and that way I escaped the snow front coming up from the south.

 The image is another one taken yesterday. I guess it would have looked better today, amid the falling snow, but I was eager to leave, worrying about road conditions.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/brian_eno/caught_between.html" target="_blank">Caught Between</a>" from Brian Eno's 2005 masterpiece "Another Day on Earth". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pzmKzfdAkk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
