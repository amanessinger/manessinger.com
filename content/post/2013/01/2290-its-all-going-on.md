This is an image that I made on my way to the train today. I didn't have much time, I saw the glass and the stairs behind, the reflections and the distortions, and in ten seconds I had the image.

Out of the camera I didn't think much of it, but honestly, there was not much choice, thus I began working on it, and voilÃ , in the end I really, really like it ðŸ™‚

 Sorry for not being very responsive these days, it's not arrogance or that I don't value your comments, much to the contrary, but I still don't feel too well. I'm cycling through all variants of an influenza, currently the cough is gone and I have a sore throat, but I really hope this will get better soon. Meanwhile it just has to go on ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "It's All Going On" from Marc Almond's 2010 album "VarietÃ©". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZVFzpwQivM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
