It's Friday night, I still feel sick. Here is an image for Tuesday, taken Wednesday evening after I left the office. 

 The pattern of the puddles on the ground reminded me of a map with mysterious continents and seas, therefore the title.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/echo_and_the_bunnymen/seven_seas.html" target="_blank">Seven Seas</a>" from the 1985 Echo and the Bunnymen compilation "Songs To Learn And Sing". It's my favorite song of the album, hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE3uc2cBCk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
