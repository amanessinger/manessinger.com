Yesterday it already felt like snow, although it fell only today. Yesterday I also began to feel sick, and later I spent a feverish night in a hotel room in Styria.  

 I lay down at 5 pm and when I woke up at 10 pm, I wanted to process and post this image. I couldn't though, because I had forgotten the camera in the car ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/creedence_clearwater_revival/gloomy.html" target="_blank">Gloomy</a>" from the 1968 self-titled Creedence Clearwater Revival debut album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5Cpcfr6Yy8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
