During Wednesday night and all through Thursday snow fell upon this country. Masses of snow are not unusual for Carinthia, but I heard of more than 30 cm in Vienna!

 OK, it's not fifteen feet, more like one foot or in places one and a half, but from the right perspective it looks dramatic enough to a sick man ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/nick_cave_and_the_bad_seeds/fifteen_feet_of_pure_white_snow.html" target="_blank">Fifteen Feet Of Pure White Snow</a>" from the sensationally good 2001 Nick Cave album "No More Shall We Part". This is surely not the first time that I've used that song, but we won't be pedantic, will we? Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sfhvxTZ0wo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
