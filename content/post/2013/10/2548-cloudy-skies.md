I've had a very similar picture some time ago in "<a href="/2013/08/2501-sheep-go-to-heaven.html" target="_blank">2501 â€“ Sheep Go To Heaven</a>", but, while this one is not strictly necessary, it feels different and I like it.

The difference between the sky in the background and the sky in the reflection was originally even more pronounced, to a degree that I had to apply partial filtering in post-processing, in order to make it not look faked ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Cloudy Skies" with Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYO81JBoPVQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
