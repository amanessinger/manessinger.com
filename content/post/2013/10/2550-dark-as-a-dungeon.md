Vienna's Underground system is not as extensive as those in London, Paris, New York or other big cities that have had Undergrounds since longer than any living person can remember, but it is really nice. I love the architecture, I love the friendly, clean and well-lit connections, and I almost feel I have to apologize that I often portray them in a much darker way than they really are.

 It's just that I find it more interesting to concentrate on the traces of use in dark corners than on unmarred, spotless, shiny surfaces. Not alway, but most of the time ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/johnny_cash/dark_as_a_dungeon.html" target="_blank">Dark As A Dungeon</a>" from Johnny Cash's 1968 live album "At Folsom Prison". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsfzCZCFP0Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
