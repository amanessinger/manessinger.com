This is the very same fence that we had in "<a href="/2013/09/2525-disguises.html" target="_blank">2525 - Disguises</a>". It's even the same lens with almost the same aperture, but it is a different poster. I don't know what the original poster shows and this is only a part of it. The posters on the fence belong to some art project seemingly protesting the closing and demolishing of the market behind the fence. 

 I really like how well the peeling corners of the sheets fit the underlying motive of industrial decay. The color contrast is also nice. The most vivid colors are those of the blue backside of the posters and of the bare wooden surface below. The tears in the fabric of "reality" are more real than reality itself. Or something like that. No idea what it means, but it sure sounds impressively philosophic ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is again "Disguises" from the 1980 album "Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzL8YFQGfgM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
