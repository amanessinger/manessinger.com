Living far from Vienna's center now has completely changed my approach. I don't have to walk through center districts any more to get to work, I more or less cross the street. I walk less because I need to, and instead I do it willfully, more like a tourist than like an inhabitant. And that's OK. It makes me explore and see in a way I have not done in a long time. The downside is, that I often come up with typical tourist sights. This clock in Vienna's Hoher Markt (High Market) is one of them. I hope you don't mind.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/john_prine/six_oclock_news.html" target="_blank">Six O'Clock News</a>" from John Prine's 1971 self-titled debut album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oliKRRw6ACk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
