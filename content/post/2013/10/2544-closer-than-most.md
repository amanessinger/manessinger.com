Today's three images were taken with my single least-used lens, the Olympus 60/2.8 macro.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130928_091014_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130928_091014_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's not a bad lens, not at all, it's only that macro photography is not my fort√©. By all means, I really should sell this lens, pass it on to someone with a passion for macro photography, but then, I always had at least one macro lens, and sometimes they come handy.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130928_091144_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130928_091144_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The Image of the Day is of a wet cobweb on a fence, the water drops are on a leaf below the fence, and the third image shows the scene from a normal perspective.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/closer_than_most.html" target="_blank">Closer Than Most</a>" from the 2000 Beautiful South album "Painting It Red". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwLVGJAbKl0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
