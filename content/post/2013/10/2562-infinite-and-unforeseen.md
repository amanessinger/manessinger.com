I don't know why these pears go to waste. They just do. They fall from the tree on a field and simply rot. 

The trees they grow on are old, I suppose at least 50 years, and that may explain it. In former times they might have been collected, squeezed in a must press, and although must made from pears has always been regarded as inferior to that pressed of apples, it may have sold then. 

 Anyway, here they lie on the ground, 50 meters from our home, and if they serve no other purpose now, they still found their way on my blog. Flickr has the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/10350914866/sizes/o/" target="_blank">full size</a>.
