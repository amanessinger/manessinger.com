Here's a sycamore tree in front of beautiful fall foliage. The image is sharp enough while not just as sharp as this lens would have been capable of.

 But really: an effective focal length of 150&nbsp;mm and 1/20s, for that it's quite OK. Just imagine it had been some camera's kit lens ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Fall Foliage" from the 2010 Soap&amp;Skin album "Lovetune For Vacuum". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUZ-TVjHEkA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
