I would have thought it's not the time for dandelions, but strangely some of them blossom completely out of season.

 Here I have used black and white to accentuate the similarity of shapes. Color with yellow and white on a green background was just a tad to literal for my taste.

The Song of the Day is "Dandelion" from Eddi Reader's 2008 album "Love Is The Way". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViY0GEtzkAU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
