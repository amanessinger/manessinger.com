This is a spot at the shore of river Danube, just opposite of GÃ¤nsehÃ¤ufel, Vienna's biggest public bath. I've been there very often, but it was always a remote place, a place that I could only reach via two Underground lines, and then I still had to walk ten minutes.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131021_174305_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131021_174305_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Now I live and work in the vicinity, but so far I had not realized how near it is. OK, recently I found it out: it's 18 minutes from work, walking without a hurry, taking an image now and then. 

 If I don't walk and instead take public transport, it only takes me ten minutes longer ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Down By The Riverside" by Maceo Parker. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI6w0eLVYjo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
