Here's another Underground image of one of Vienna's more interesting stations. It is at the crossing of two lines, one of them very deep under ground, because it also crosses below a canal.

 The Song of the Day is "Bottom Below" from the 2008 album "Dirt Don't Hurt" by Holly Golightly &amp; The Brokeoffs. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl5kZOHoJIg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
