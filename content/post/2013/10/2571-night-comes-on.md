A calm evening at the shore of river Danube: it's been only a week ago and it feels so much longer.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131021_184657_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131021_184657_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Work is cruel at the moment, and the fact that I don't have a long way from home to work does not help my productivity as a photographer. Short ways mean short walks and less opportunity for taking pictures. That it takes some time to get into picturing mood does not help either ðŸ™‚

 Anyway, that's how it is at the moment, thus I should probably consider changing the motto of my blog. It's still daily, but the images haven't been taken daily in a long while now.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/night_comes_on.html" target="_blank">Night Comes On</a>" from Leonard Cohen's 1984 album "Various Positions". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucIS3TEAfsw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
