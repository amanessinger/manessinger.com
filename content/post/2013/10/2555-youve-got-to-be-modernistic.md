Vienna is an old city with its historic center south of river Danube. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131008_182616-Edit_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131008_182616-Edit_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> For a long time Vienna mostly ignored the river, but in recent years most development efforts have been on the north side of the river, the left side, and it is here where Vienna's biggest buildings grow up to the sky.

 Now that I live and work on that side of the river, this peripheral architecture has moved more into my focus. It does not look specifically viennese, these images could have been taken everywhere, but nevertheless I like them. You'll see more of the same tomorrow ðŸ™‚
