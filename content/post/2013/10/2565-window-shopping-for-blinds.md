I took this image while the batteries of our car were changed. Of course the blinds were horizontal, but you know me and my weird sense of orientation.

 As to the title, well, I thought this was a good one and, besides, it is just such a <a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beautiful_south/window_shopping_for_blinds.html" target="_blank">good song</a>. As almost everything by The Beautiful South I might say ðŸ™‚

Hear it on the 1998 album "Quench" or get a taste on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0g9g6YEScw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
