Here's a fleet of space invaders that I happened to capture under the ceiling of one Vienna's multitudinous shopping malls.

The Song of the Day, "Space Invaders", is from <a href="http://pornophonique.de/" target="_blank">Pornophonic</a>'s "8-bit lagerfeuer", an album released under a Creative Common's license and available from <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/list/a7505/8-bit-lagerfeuer" target="_blank">Jamendo</a>. You can download it for free, but of course nobody will mind a donation. For my downloads from Jamendo I've made it a habit to pay about the same as I'd have to pay on Amazon. After all, the artists have to pay their bills as well. Hear the Song of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xrZjrQ3GOQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
