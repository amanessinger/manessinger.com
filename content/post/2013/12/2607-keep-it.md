OK, everyone's advice is to keep this lens and I'll ... keep it. My momentary impulse would have been to sell it, but that's mostly due to the darkness of the season. I admit I may be extremely happy with this lens in summer, on day-trips down to the sea or whatever. 

 My decision is helped by the fact that the lens will very likely keep its value, and if I change my mind in a year, I will still be able to sell it without a loss. At the moment I don't suffer hardship, thus I can afford to keep the lens although I may not use it that much. Does that make sense?

The Song of the Day is "Keep It" from the Dexys Midnight Runners debut album "Searching For The Young Soul Rebels". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyUaLlCQIlA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
