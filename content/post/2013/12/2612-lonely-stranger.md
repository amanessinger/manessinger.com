I'm back to the new zoom. The macro lens is gone, the battery grip for the OM-D E-M5 was sold immediately, but the E-M5 itself still waits for someone offering a reasonable price. Obviously the market is flooded by all those who, like me, upgrade to the E-M1, and used E-M5s with lower shutter counts sell for 20 to 30 Euro below of what I ask. 

 I may slightly go down with the price next week, but I'm not in a hurry ðŸ™‚

Of course I could also keep the E-M5 as backup body, but then, that's what the Panasonic LX5 is for. I am no professional, I don't have to honor any contracts, my only need is for one image to post per day. 

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/lonely_stranger_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Lonely Stranger</a>" from the Eric Clapton album "Unplugged". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCFYq3qJ1zE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
