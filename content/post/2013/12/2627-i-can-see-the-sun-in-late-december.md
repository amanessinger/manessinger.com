At least a few days ago I could. At the moment it's rather warm for the time of the year and it's raining. Pouring, to be precise ðŸ™‚

 This image was made at the same time as "<a href="/2013/12/2624-fade-away.html" target="_blank">2624 â€“ Fade Away</a>", just looking into the other direction.

The Song of the Day is "I Can See The Sun In Late December" from Roberta Flack's 1974 album "Feel Like Makin' Love". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH7fLwEgSMc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
