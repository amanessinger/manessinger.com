As I said in the last post, I am still thinking about selling my 12-40/2.8 lens, but let's forget that for a while, let's look at what it can do while I still have it.

A few days ago I've taken some extreme images shot directly into the rising sun. Did the lens flare? Well, it did, and depending on the exact position of the sun in the frame, it did more or less so. In today's image it did not, and I'd say this lens does not flare worse than any of my primes. I'd say that's quite an achievement for a zoom.

 By the way, this image may be sunny, but it was windy and cold while I took it. It's time for mittens again. Oh, and: the OM-D E-M1 is perfectly usable with mittens on. No problem at all and much better than the E-M5.
