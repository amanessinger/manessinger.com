I saw this old truck in one of Villach's industrial areas. I suppose it's decoration now.

 These trucks were built by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96AF" target="_blank">Ã–sterreichische Automobil-Fabrik</a> and in the 1960s and 1970s they were among the best-selling trucks in Austria. The name "Tornado" feels slightly exaggerated though ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/g/george_michael/wild_is_the_wind.html" target="_blank">Wild Is The Wind</a>" from George Michael's 2011 album "Songs From The Last Century". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRJlu9BhX-w" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
