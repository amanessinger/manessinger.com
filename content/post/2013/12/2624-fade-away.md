Today was a sunny day in Carinthia, but we decided to drive down to sunny Italy, just because we could. 

No good idea. We entered the second tunnel in Italy still in sunlight, and when we left it a kilometer later, the sun was gone and the sky shrouded in dense, high fog.

 It took us a while to get back, but thankfully we still caught some glimpses of sunlight before it faded away. This is again Mount Dobratsch, this time seen from the valley to the west.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/fade_away.html" target="_blank">Fade Away</a>" from Bruce Springsteen's 1980 album "The River". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OXMvyZJ53o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
