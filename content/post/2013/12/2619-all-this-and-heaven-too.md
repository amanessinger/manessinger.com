Coming out of the fog, standing up there in the snow, it feels like being in a different world, a world above the clouds, above misery and sorrow, a kind of heaven.

Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FRPg9DS-oA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

By the way, this is an album that I have long awaited and then just kept on my Amazon Shopping List for two years. Now I've bought it as a CD, along with a few other things on the list.

 Why as a CD, you ask? Yes, why indeed? Have I not decided to stop buying plastic?

Fact is, it was cheaper. To be precise: CD plus MP3 downloads were cheaper than the MP3 downloads alone. Capitalism, my ass! Sometimes it defies all reason ðŸ˜„
