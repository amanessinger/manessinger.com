The last few days I didn't have much luck photographing. Most of the time I had not enough time, and when I could spare some, I was in the right place at the wrong time or vice versa.

 This short afternoon trip to Ossiacher See, a lake near Villach, worked well enough though. I walked away with some material to work with.

Oh, by the way, a Merry Christmas to all of you who care about that tradition, and a few days of peace to everybody. 

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cyndi_lauper/above_the_clouds.html" target="_blank">Above The Clouds</a>" from Cyndi Lauper's 2005 album "The Body Acoustic". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHQ2KjM0N_8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
