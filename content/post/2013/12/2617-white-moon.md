The last few days we had fog in Villach, but only below around 750 meters. This image was taken from almost 1000 meters above. You'll see more images from my short after-work trip to Mount Dobratsch in the next few posts ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "White Moon" from the 2005 White Stripes album "Get Behind Me Satan". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7XywuICl64" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
