Here are some more images taken at Vienna's Jewish cemetery, this time in color.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131216_150429_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131216_150429_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The day began with low fog, but by the time I had arrived at the cemetery gates, the fog had risen and I couldn't make those graves-in-the-fog images, that I had come to take in the first place.

Nevertheless, there was dense fog between me and the sun, just not low enough to be photographically useful. Thus the light was low and colors were washed out.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131216_152920_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131216_152920_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> One of the improvements in Lightroom 5.3 is, that they deliver camera profiles for Olympus cameras. These images use the camera profile "Vivid" (and then some additional vibrancy), thus they look less dull than it was. To my eyes the result is pretty believable.
