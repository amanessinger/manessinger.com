I've promised you snow, here is snow. I had come too late to strive for the very summit, but I could take a side route into an area where you see the steep cliffs on the southern side of Mount Dobratsch.

What else? Oh yes, it's the end of the year.

Was it a good year? 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131228_145250_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131228_145250_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> In general I'd say no. It was a particularly bad year for all the refugees who died at sea, trying to enter a fortified Europe, it was a bad year for the people of Syria, who found themselves as helpless victims of a domestic dictator and of ruthless, cynical foreign politics, and it was <a href="http://www.tedgioia.com/nsa_facts.html" target="_blank">a bad year for everyone who up to now has believed in democracy and freedom</a>. 

It was the year when Rick Falkvinge plausibly explained why it's probably too <a href="http://falkvinge.net/2013/06/30/with-journalism-persecuted-the-united-states-is-now-at-event-horizon-to-a-police-state/" target="_blank">late for the US to stop becoming a police state</a>, and once the dominant empire goes down into plutocratic totalitarianism, hardly any hope is left for the rest of us.

Was it all bad? Personally I can't say so. I'm working in an interesting project with people I like, I suffer no hardship, I'm healthy and so are the people I love. Things are fine around here.

 I even have a new camera. I've been using the OM-D E-M1 for about a month now, and although the OM-D E-M5 was a good camera, the E-M1 is better. It has a bigger, better viewfinder, better ergonomics, knows a few new tricks, and in general it gives up nothing of what made the OM-D E-M5 everybody's Camera of the Year 2012. 

No, personally I'm doing well, but, dear governments, can I still have some democracy and freedom please? I swear, I'll praise you next year. Thanks a lot!
