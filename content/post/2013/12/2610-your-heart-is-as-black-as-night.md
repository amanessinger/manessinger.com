It's not black, it was not deep night, there's a lot of blue and purple in this image, anyway, it all does not count. It's the music that forced the title upon me ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/melody_gardot/your_heart_is_as_black_as_night.html" target="_blank">Your Heart Is As Black As Night</a>". I have two versions of it, and although Melody Gardot's version is perfectly OK, it can't stand against the one by Joe Bonamassa and Beth Hart from their album "Don't Explain". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2egMG4uFd8A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
