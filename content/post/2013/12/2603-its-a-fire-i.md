We had a pretty sunny week in Carinthia, and morning after morning I was annoyed by my failure to rise early and go down to take a few sunrise images. 

One day I managed to get out early enough, only to find a completely blank sky. Isn't that stupid, I thought? All those days with great morning skies, and then, when finally I'm ready, the sky is not.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131129_074925_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131129_074925_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Anticipating a boring and colorless sunrise from behind the mountains, I decided to at least see how the landscape around Faaker See, one of the nearest lakes, looks in morning light. 

So I stood there on a hill, looking over the lake, seeing mists rise from cool water into icy air, and I found the view boring. OK, from somewhere behind the mountains the sun would come out, but I had the feeling that there was not much to be expected.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131129_075017_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131129_075017_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> And I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong! 

Of course I could have looked up on my phone where exactly the sun would rise, but because I was in a hurry to get to work, I had not. I did not have much choice regarding my vista anyway. I stood in the one place that was near enough and where I could stop the car. Regardless of where the sun would come out, I'd have to accept it.

When it happened, I was surprised. I had not expected the sun to rise exactly behind the lake and the mist, and of course this made all the difference in the world.

 By the way, some of the images that I made were taken at 1/8000&nbsp;s. The OM-D E-M5 only went to 1/4000&nbsp;s, so that's one of the goodies of my new camera.

The Song of the Day is "It's A Fire" from the 1994 Portishead album "Dummy". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxd2-qmQix8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
