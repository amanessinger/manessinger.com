Remember, I recently bought the Olympus OM-D E-M1 camera with its kit lens, the new 12-40/2.8 PRO, a lens that costs 990€ separately. As part of the kit it cost me 700€, thus I could easily sell it on, maybe even with a profit. Should I?

I admit, I think about it. Not for the profit, but more so because it is big and heavy (compared to my primes), overlaps with three of my lenses, the 12/2.0, 17/1.8 and at least partially with the 9-18/4, and although it is an excellent lens, it is not better than any of these primes.

It also overlaps with the Panasonic Leica 25/1.4. Yes, I've had that lens and sold it, but guess what, I miss the Panaleica and consider buying it again.

It is weather-sealed. OK, I didn't miss that in my primes. 

It focuses very near, nearer than any of my primes. I like that and I may miss it.

It is extremely well built, definitely the most solid lens that I've ever had. 

It is beautiful.

 The Song of the Day is "Think About It", an outtake from the 1977 Fleetwood Mac album "Rumours". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OmgG_nAvpo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
