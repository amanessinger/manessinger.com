There is not much snow on Mount Dobratsch at the moment. Since the last snowfall we had mostly fair weather above the fog, but what is left, has been swept by the wind into bizarre forms.

I was there about half an hour before sundown. The light was already coming low. Someone saw me and asked what I found so interesting on the ground. Lines, I said. Lines.

 Snow is an interesting substance, and especially so when it is not fresh. There is a filigree of ice on the surface, and below it begins to melt away, sometimes leaving only a crust. Other parts look like sand dunes and others not like anything we know at all. It's all in your head what you see in it.

The Song of the Day is "In Your Head" by Gabby Young and Other Animals, from their 2012 album "The Band Called Out for More". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq9hourHzg8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
