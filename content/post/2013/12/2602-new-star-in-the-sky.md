I've taken this image after the sun had vanished behind the mountains, and then, without thinking, I just went home. 

Hmm ... clear, cold day, these clouds, I mean, every idiot would have recognized that we were in for a spectacular sundown. And so it was. I arrived at home, was busy for a few minutes with one of the computers, and when I looked up, the sky was in flames like I've not yet seen this year.

 You see, always running around with a camera is a good idea, but without using your brain it all comes to nothing. Oh well, sunsets are overrated anyway ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/air/new_star_in_the_sky.html" target="_blank">New Star In The Sky</a>" from the 1998 Air album "Moon Safari". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwjmqYdb_EU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
