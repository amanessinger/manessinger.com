To be honest, not only is this not the top of the world, it's not even the top of Mount Dobratsch. It is a spot more than 200 meters below the summit, just a few meters above and off the highest parking area. 

 Does it matter to me? Not at all when I've just made it out of the fog and into the sun ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Top Of The World" from the 1990 James album "Gold Mother". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGolY8jE-Wo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
