The Giant Ferris Wheel in Vienna (red in the background of this image) was erected to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Emperor Franz Josef I in 1897. It is at the entrance of Wurstelprater, the traditional amusement park in Vienna's second district.

 The area has recently been renovated, which was accompanied by a political scandal, but to be honest, I think the result is quite OK. Slightly Las Vegas (not on this image), but I don't see how that could be wrong for an amusement park.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bob_dylan/this_wheels_on_fire.html" target="_blank">This Wheel's On Fire</a>" from The Band's final concert "The Last Waltz". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHnA2tmaq2U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
