In two weeks my company will move to another part of Vienna or, to be precise, some people have already moved this week, while the majority, including myself, will move in about two weeks.

The old building is typical 1970s glass architecture and part of its facade is projecting outwards, in an angle of 45 degrees. Naturally that opens many options to play with reflections. I have done so in the past, here I do it again, most likely for the last time.

 The new building is ugly and utilitarian. I have not seen it from the inside yet, but I guess its outside won't feature in any future posts ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is again "Reflection Rag" by Scott Joplin. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXYV3kgyJzc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
