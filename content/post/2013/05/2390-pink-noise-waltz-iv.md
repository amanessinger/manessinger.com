Friday morning I took a series of images of fallen blossoms. They look like a great and easy subject, but in fact most of the pictures came to nothing. But then, the culprit could be not the subject but the photographer ðŸ˜„

 Anyway, it was probably the last time this year that image could have been taken. It's all gone now, and what may still be there has lost its color.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/diablo_swing_orchestra/pink_noise_waltz.html" target="_blank">Pink Noise Waltz</a>" from the 2006 Diablo Swing Orchestra album "The Butcher's Ballroom". Incredibly good, but hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwC4IFz512o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
