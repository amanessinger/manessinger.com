Here's some construction work in Vienna. This is in the same block where my company will have its new office, a hundred meters from my apartment. At the moment there is still a lot going on here, there is dust and dirt and noise, but I hope everything will settle down soon. 

 And then: even construction work can look good on such a day ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/when_the_whip_comes_down.html" target="_blank">When The Whip Comes Down</a>" from the 1978 Rolling Stones album "Some Girls". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vjIP7-SiX0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
