I've passed this turkish kebab fast food outlet a few times by car, having to wait in a queue a few meters before reaching the best spot to take an image, and then, when the queue began to move again, having to pass quickly to not irate the people behind me.

This time, when I was at a shop nearby, I decided to walk over and take an image. When I saw the path, I decided to include it and therefore take a different image. I may get back again though ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "Path" from the 2000 Apocalyptica album "Cult". I have no idea why this album is not available as digital downloads. I suppose it's the usual idiocy of this industry that is so famous for it. They seem to believe keeping files in stock is expensive or something like that. Maybe because of the weight? It's Heavy Metal after all ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„
