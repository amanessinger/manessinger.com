This is the post for last Tuesday, April 30, and the image was really taken that day in Vienna.

 To be honest, it's not halfway up, it's halfway down the stairs, but we won't be picky. It gives me the opportunity to link to "Halfway Up The Stairs", another song by Sixto Rodriguez, taken from his second album "Coming from Reality". 

 Like probably most people outside his neighborhood, South Africa and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rodriguez-10-things-you-dont-know-about-the-searching-for-sugar-man-star-20130328" target="_blank">Australia</a>, I didn't know him before I saw "<a href="http://www.sonyclassics.com/searchingforsugarman/" target="_blank">Searching for Sugar Man</a>". It's such a crazy story and most people instantly react like "That must be made up!". It's not and it is good to know that those things still happen. At times ðŸ˜„

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2FO5_3xu-A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
