It's Sunday, I'm on the train to Vienna and here is an image for Thursday. Again this is an image that needed some post-processing to bring out the reds and the blues.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tori_amos/precious_things.html" target="_blank">Precious Things</a>" from Tori Amos' 1992 debut "Little Earthquakes". I've had it more than half of this blog's life ago in "<a href="/2009/11/1127-precious-things.html" target="_blank">1127 â€“ Precious Things</a>" for some over-saturated architecture, here it is again for nature's beauty. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi9NUoZmulU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
