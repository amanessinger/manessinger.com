Boy can Google be useless. One worst case is looking for songs with one-word titles by the band James ðŸ™‚

 YouTube seemingly does not have the original from the 2008 album "Hey Ma", but they have an acoustic cover that's actually not bad. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLp8JGtpXjQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

The image? Well, a case of looking at things from unusual angles. I really like that one.
