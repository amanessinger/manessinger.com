Thursday was rainy, but when you've trained yourself to look at unusual things, it is not hard to find something interesting and colorful whenever you are in need. 

 These are the remains of advertising posters put on a fence and torn down again for years and years. I thought there must be an image here, took a few frames, and I pretty like what I came away with.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tanita_tikaram/for_all_these_years.html" target="_blank">For All These Years</a>" from Tanita Tikaram's 1988 debut album, "Ancient Heart". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIs5dJiee0E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
