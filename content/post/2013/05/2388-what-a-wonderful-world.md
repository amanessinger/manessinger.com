Wednesday morning was "Labor Day" here in Austria, a public holiday, and I used it to drive back from Vienna to Villach by car. On Sundays and holidays trucks are banned from Austrian highways, and that makes for much more relaxed traveling.

 The image was taken later that day in a place very near to where we lived for so many years. 

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/louis_armstrong/what_a_wonderful_world.html" target="_blank">What A Wonderful World</a>" in the rendition of Tony Bennett and k.d.lang. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFm5nzBQFnw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
