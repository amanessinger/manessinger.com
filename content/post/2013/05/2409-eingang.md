Today is Wednesday, I am on the train from Vienna to Carinthia and this is the last post for today. I still have a few images left for the next days and if weather in Carinthia gets as bad as it is predicted, I may even need them ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "Eingang" by Anton Webern. 

Hmm ... as much as I like SchÃ¶nberg (although mostly for the brilliant "Pierrot LumiÃ©re"), I find Webern always depressing. Anyway, hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54O-2oxg3Ks" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
