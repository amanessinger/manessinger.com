Let me try the same title one more time, may I? This is for Sunday, totally different subject, but I guess the title works as well ðŸ™‚

By the way, this is an excellent example of an image that needs post-processing, and it is also an excellent example of how good Lightroom is at preserving highlight detail, or in this image rather detail in the extreme reds.

 Again the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eric_clapton/theyre_red_hot_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Theyâ€™re Red Hot</a>", but this time I can recommend Eric Clapton on his 2003 album "Me And Mr. Johnson". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRENNux7Q_Q" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
