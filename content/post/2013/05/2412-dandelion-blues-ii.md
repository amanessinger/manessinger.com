Today I saw some images of meadows covered all over in yellow dandelions. I saw them on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jiihaa/" target="_blank">Juha' photostream</a> on Flickr and that allowed me a relatively accurate comparison between the climates of southern Finland and Austria. We had exactly the same meadows between about three and two weeks ago.

This year winter lasted unusually long and even this weekend we had temperatures below ten degrees Celsius and fresh snow on the mountains. Hmm ... as far as I remember, last year I was swimming at or around the first of May.

 The Song of the Day is "Dandelion Blues"  from the 1966 self-titled Incredible String Band album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF2pR4hq02k" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
