Some photographers consider themselves "Nature Photographers" and for them it may make sense. For me not.

Nature can be clearly defined as that which is not created by man. Or woman ðŸ™‚

But when you look closer, distinctions begin to blur. Whatever we create, it begins to rot and decay under the influence of nature. Now, when the artificial is unmade in a natural process, it not only becomes nature again, it does so gradually, beginning right from the first instant. 

 So, when I make images like this, don't I photograph nature? And if or if not, how meaningful is the distinction anyway?

The Song of the Day is "Second Nature" from the 2001 Eric Clapton album "Reptile". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjxh_U4GXGA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
