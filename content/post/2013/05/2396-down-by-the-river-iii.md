Just in case you wonder why the last Post was "<a href="/2013/05/2395-down-by-the-river.html" target="_blank">2395 â€“ Down By The River</a>" and this is suddenly #3: The reason is that I forgot a post with this title from a few eternities past. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130505_171134_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130505_171134_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> "<a href="/2006/12/53-down-by-river.html" target="_blank">53 â€“ Down by the River</a>" is from December 2006, and that means it is from before I even began with the Song of the Day.

 Anyway. Here's another series of two images from my walk in Vienna's National Park "Donauauen". Both images are mostly about balance and the Image of the Day a little more successfully so ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/neil_young/down_by_the_river.html" target="_blank">Down By The River</a>" from Neil Young's 1969 album "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere". Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoA5cqDSasM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
