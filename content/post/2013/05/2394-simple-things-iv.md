That's what I meant in the last post: Again something is given an importance that it normally wouldn't have. In the color version of this image the red dot was already prominent enough, but the colors in the windows were distracting.

 Normally I don't like this technique of selective black and white, but sometimes I feel it adds to the image. This is such a case.

One more time the Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/the_crash/simple_things.html" target="_blank">Simple Things</a>" from the 2002 album "Wildlife" by The Crash. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-YakOIJsT0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
