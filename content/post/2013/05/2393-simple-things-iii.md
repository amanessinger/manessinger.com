There is an element of surrealism in this image. The stencil in the background reads "mehr mehr", meaning "more more". It is in no way connected to anything else depicted here, but the way I have framed the image and due to the contrasting color, it becomes a strong focal point, giving it an importance that it normally wouldn't have. Consequently a hidden meaning is suggested, a mystery is hinted at, geometric structure seems to imply a message.

 You may have seen that method of framing in many of my past images and you will see it for sure in the next ðŸ™‚
