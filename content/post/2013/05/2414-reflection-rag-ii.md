I like reflections for their mysterious distortions of reality. I guess I should do more of them, but it is hard not to forget it. 

We are conditioned to make sense of reality by reducing it to its minimum constituents. We see the single moving tiger but not the immensity of the forest. 

 That's great for survival, but it is an annoying habit for photographers. You can't really "unlearn" it (and you shouldn't, unless you are weary of your life). The only thing you can do is to anticipate it and consciously concentrate on the distractions. 

The Song of the Day is "Reflection Rag" by Scott Joplin. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXYV3kgyJzc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
