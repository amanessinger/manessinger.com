This is the post for Friday, featuring an image taken ... I don't know ... sometime last week. I've been busy. Very, very busy.

This is not a particularly original image, I may have posted an image with roughly the same subject years ago, but in a way I like it. Maybe it's only for the fact that it didn't amaze me at all until ... I turned it around. Suddenly the plain look up this old, shabby house got tension, lost its feeling of gravity. Sometimes an image can get better just by rotating it. Funny, huh?

 The Song of the Day is "Turnaround" from the classic Pat Metheny album "80/81". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue1hPNUiCQY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
