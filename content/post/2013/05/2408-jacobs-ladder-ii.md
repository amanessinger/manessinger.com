Ok, ok, it could be someone else's ladder as well, I don't claim to know, it's only that songs with "ladder" in their title are exceedingly rare ðŸ˜„

 The Song that gave this Tuesday post its title is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/bruce_springsteen/jacobs_ladder.html" target="_blank">Jacob's Ladder</a>" from Bruce Springsteen and the Sessions Band's 2007 album "Live In Dublin". I've had the song in "<a href="/2012/02/1961-jacobs-ladder.html" target="_blank">1961 â€“ Jacobâ€™s Ladder</a>", more than a year ago, and it was simply time again to hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CqAOLAPLsU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
