Here is an older image for Monday, taken two weeks ago. It was a bright, sunny day and the sun sparkled in the chrome letters on the roof of this Peugeot dealer.

 Except of a short and unlucky intermezzo with a Mazda 121 around 1994 (followed by an intermediate Toyota for almost a year) we've always had french cars. First came two Citroen CV2, later two Renault Twingo, but we never had a Peugeot. Perhaps an experience still waiting ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/joan_baez/blue_sky.html" target="_blank">Blue Sky</a>" from Joan Baez' 1975 album "Diamonds &amp; Rust". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UoTqvEtiFM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
