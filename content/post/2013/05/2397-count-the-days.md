This is the post for Friday, but the images were already taken Thursday afternoon. In normal springs Carinthia is about two weeks behind Vienna, but due to the late snow, this year it's only a few days. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130509_150420_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130509_150420_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> These days the difference is obvious though. I see it in the dandelions. The meadows in and around Vienna are already white, while the hills of Carintha are still dominated by yellow.

 A few days from now they will be white as well and nobody will be able to tell the difference.

The Song of the Day is "Count The Days" by Marcia Ball. Hear it on <a href="http://www.moskva.fm/artist/marcia_ball/song_1150228" target="_blank">Moskva.fm</a>.
