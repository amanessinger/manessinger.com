This time of the year it can be rainy and cold, but as soon as the sun comes out, we can't ignore the strength of the light. It's spring, summer is near, days are long and the fresh morning light reminds me of vacations in my youth, when we drove down to former Yugoslavia on bad and crowded streets, trying to avoid traffic by starting out in the middle of the night, enjoying the light of southern mornings.

 Those times are long gone and the images are still fresh in my mind. When I think of it, seeing images that last for decades, I guess that's what we should do more often, and mind you: it's not <em>what</em> you look at, it's <em>how</em> you look at it ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/morning_glory.html" target="_blank">Morning Glory</a>", a wonderful Leonard Cohen composition from his 2004 album "Dear Heather". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5VqZdZDOAg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
