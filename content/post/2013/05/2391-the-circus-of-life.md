When I was a child, it was a big thing when the circus came to town. I remember having seen not more than maybe four or five shows in all my life, and the last one a few years ago in Villach. It was out of nostalgia, but I really can't recommend the experience. Unless you have kids of course, then you probably don't have the choice ðŸ™‚

Why not? Well, I had memories of a gigantic tent, lions, tigers and elephants, and all sorts of exotic attractions. Once you're grown up, everything looks small, and although it is a good thing that lions, tigers and elephants can't be shown any more, it also takes away much of the magic. Sad but true.

Anyway. The Song of the Day is "Billy's Ray Circus of Life" by Yvalain, sung by Sean Wright. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khTU4cxuQ20" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
