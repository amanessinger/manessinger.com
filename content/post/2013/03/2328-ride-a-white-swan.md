In the last post I wrote about Sunday's elections in Carinthia, but here on the blog it's actually still Saturday. And while the image for Friday's post and Sunday's news was taken on Saturday, let me further confuse you with an image taken on Sunday for Saturday's post. Here we go ðŸ™‚ 

 I was pretty lucky with this image. It was the last in a series, with the swan swimming away from me, right into the reflection of the sun. Here they came perfectly together. You can't plan such a shot, it's pure luck and you can only be thankful. It helps to be prepared though ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is the T-Rex classic "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/t_rex/ride_a_white_swan.html" target="_blank">Ride A White Swan</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9rFoPyqFoA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
