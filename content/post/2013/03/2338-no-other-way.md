You see, I fully recognize this is no way to write a supposedly daily photo blog, but at the moment there is no other way possible for me. I'll still try to keep it a littly more regular in the future though ðŸ˜„

 Anyway, I've caught up, this is the post for today, featuring an image taken today, about 3.5 minutes after that of the last post.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paolo_nutini/no_other_way.html" target="_blank">No Other Way</a>" from Paolo Nutini's so-far only album, the 2009 release "Sunny Side Up". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2_ik2WLYPQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
