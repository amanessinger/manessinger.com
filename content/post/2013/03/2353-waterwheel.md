The image for Wednesday was actually taken Thursday afternoon, just after I had given back the keys to the old apartment. I strolled one more time through Vienna's seventh district, my hunting ground for so many years.

Weather was mostly unfriendly this week. We had snow and rain, but on Thursday the sun was shining. 

 The Song of the Day is "Escalay ('Waterwheel')" from the exceptional 1992 Kronos Quartet album "Pieces of Africa". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhBU-16Z-lo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
