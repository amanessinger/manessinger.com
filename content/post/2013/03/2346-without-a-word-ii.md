It's Wednesday and here you finally have an image taken today.

 At the moment I am on the train from Vienna to Carinthia. Having to wait for the carpenter gives me some days to relax. I'll still be working the next two days, but compared to what I did most of the last two weeks, programming will feel like being on vacation ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Without A Word" from the 2008 Giant Sand album "Provisions". I have used it before in "<a href="/2012/03/1969-without-a-word.html" target="_blank">1969 â€“ Without A Word</a>". Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_E2A4Q9vYw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
