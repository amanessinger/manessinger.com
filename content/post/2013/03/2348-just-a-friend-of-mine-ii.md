I first used this title an eternity ago in "<a href="/2008/12/783-just-friend-of-mine.html" target="_blank">783 â€“ Just A Friend Of Mine</a>", and there I spoke about expertise and how you get better in doing things by doing them. I said there's always room for improvement.

Well, I was right ðŸ™‚

When I see that image of the bicycle that accompanied that post, I can only cringe. How could I have missed such an obvious opportunity to anchor the subject in three corners? How could I have missed how awkward the bike hangs in the frame?

 But anyway, this tree, photographed and featured on this blog a couple of times, is another friend of mine. Just a poser, I might say. Every time I pass by, I feel the urge to take an image. Once or twice a year I do ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/vaya_con_dios/just_a_friend_of_mine.html" target="_blank">Just A Friend Of Mine</a>" from the 1987 self-titled Vaya Con Dios debut album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBPYWYZanpw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
