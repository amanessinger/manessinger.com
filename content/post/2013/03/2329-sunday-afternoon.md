Through a beautifully sunny winter landscape my train is rolling on its way to Vienna. It's a little unfortunate that I can't take images right now, especially because I will be busy today, but maybe a few images will be possible.

 This one was taken yesterday afternoon at one of the local supermarkets that are open on Sundays during the tourist season. I saw the late sun on the shopping carts and liked the pattern of light and shadow.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/paul_simon/sunday_afternoon.html" target="_blank">Sunday Afternoon</a>" from Paul Simon's "Songs From The Capeman", one of his most underrated albums. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddhxi6fdzP8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
