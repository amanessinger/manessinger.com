Angry? Well, not really, but this guy really is ðŸ™‚

Here I am again with another helpless attempt to catch up and post for the few readers I might still have. In short, it was chaos and a terrible lot of work, but I am finally out of the old apartment. The new is far from finished yet, but at least I have a kitchen, all furniture that I wanted to move has been moved, some new has been bought, my CDs and books are there (though still down in the basement), and from now on everything I do is building and adding and cleaning and creating order. That's a big step from cleaning the old apartment. Somehow it feels different. I have still work, lots of work, but I do it for myself, without pressure, without a schedule, in my own pace.

 This is the post for Monday, the image was actually taken Tuesday though.
