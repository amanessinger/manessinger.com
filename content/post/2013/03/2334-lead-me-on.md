Friday's image was taken on Thursday as well, one of the few days last week, that I could find the time to take any images at all.

 The Song of the Day is "Lead Me On" from "No Regrets", the 2009 collaboration of Randy Crawford and Joe Sample. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFD_-REUE1I" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
