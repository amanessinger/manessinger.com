It's Saturday and I am in Vienna to work in the old and the new apartment. Although I made some images today, here is one from yesterday. Same mountain, only this time there are three pyramids.

 The Song of the Day is again "Pyramid" from the 2006 self-titled Wolfmother album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXWxtCNBwx4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
