Tuesday I had a truck and three workers who helped me with the heavy lifting. Most of my belongings have been moved to the new apartment now, but unless the carpenter delivers my new kitchen, there is not much more that I can do.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130319_151551_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130319_151551_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Unfortunately the lift at the old place was too small for most of the furniture, and therefore the things had to be carried down from the fourth floor. It didn't help either, that the lift at the new place was temporarily out of order. We had to carry everything up to the new apartment, again on the fourth floor. Bad luck, huh?

 We finished in the early afternoon, and although I had originally intended to go back to the old apartment for some cleaning, I gave up and used the time to take some images.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rem/the_lifting.html" target="_blank">The Lifting</a>" from the 2001 R.E.M. album "Reveal". Hear it on YouTube.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chh78JcKfoA" target="_blank"></a>
