Here's the post for yesterday, Saturday, a day that I spent in shops, scouting for furniture. I spare you the documentary images taken there ðŸ˜„

 The Image of the Day was taken at the end of January, almost two months ago, from the dam of a small storage lake near the border to Styria.

The Song of the Day is "Jump Over" from the 2001 De Phazz album "Death by Chocolate". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7nAxWFDPzI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
