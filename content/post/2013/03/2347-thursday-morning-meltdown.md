It's Sunday noon and I finally have some time now. Here is the post that should have happened on Thursday, with an image actually taken Thursday morning.

Thursday I took a couple of hours in the morning off to run some errands. I was surprised, the day was bright and sunny, quite contrary to what the weather report had predicted.

 Thursday was also the official start of spring, thus the sunny weather was pretty appropriate ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day would have been Prince's "I Wanna Melt With U", but that's nowhere to be found on video upload sites. No problem, I took some liberty with Gov't Mule's "Monday Mourning Meltdown" from their 2009 album "By A Thread" instead. Hear it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctV1TP4jaNs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
