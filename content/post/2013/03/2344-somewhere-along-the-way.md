It's Wednesday and here I am with an image taken Saturday in a post for Monday ðŸ™‚

I've been using the Olympus 45/1.8 a lot lately. In fact it has not left my camera for more than a week now. 

It's interesting to look at my lens statistics for this year in Lightroom. I have not bought a new lens this year, thus all lenses had equal opportunity to be used. Of course three months are not nearly long enough to make conclusions, there are always temporary favorites, but at least the stats give some indications. Let's see:

Of 1011 images with metadata (some HDRs got stripped of them) there are

<table align="center" width="40%">
<tr><th>Lens</th><th>Image count</th></tr>
<tr><td>Olympus 17/1.8</td><td>379</td></tr>
<tr><td>Olympus 45/1.8</td><td>204</td></tr>
<tr><td>Panasonic/Leica 25/1.4</td><td>158</td></tr>
<tr><td>Olympus 12/2.0</td><td>106</td></tr>
<tr><td>Olympus 75/1.8</td><td>91</td></tr>
<tr><td>Olympus 40-150/4-5.6</td><td>52</td></tr>
<tr><td>Panasonic 7-14/4.0</td><td>17</td></tr>
<tr><td>Olympus 60/2.8 Macro</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table><br />

I think that's at least interesting. Of my two most expensive lenses the 75/1.8 ranks only as #5, and the other, the 7-14 hardly gets used at all. Additionally those two are also by far the heaviest of my lenses.

The clear last place for the 60/2.8 only confirms what I have said for years now: I am no macro shooter. I have used macro lenses like the Sigma 70/2.8 for Nikon a lot, but only for street photography, approximately in the same way as I use the 45/1.8 now.

If I had to assemble a mini kit, I would certainly choose the 12/2.0, 17/1.8 and 45/1.8.

Having the choice only between 25/1.4 and 17/1.8, I would prefer the Olympus. There is something in its angle of view that makes it tremendously useful for me, especially when I have the long end covered by the 45/1.8. This would also be my choice for a two lens kit.

 I'm not ready to sell the 7-14 and the macro, although the numbers pronounce a harsh truth. On the other hand, my bag already feels heavy at times, and using a smaller kit most of the time is undeniably tempting.
