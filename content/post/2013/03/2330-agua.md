I'm moving. Here in Vienna I am moving to a new apartment and that eats up all of my time. The victims are photography and ... you. Sorry for that. 

 This is the post for last Monday. That's more than a week ago, and this makes it my longest hiatus from posting in the history of this blog. I'll try to catch up quickly, and in order to do so, I'll post a series of images, most made this week, but I won't write a lot. Hope you understand.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/manhattan_transfer/agua.html" target="_blank">Agua</a>" from the 1987 Manhattan Transfer album "Brasil". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HmZa4nXgiQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
