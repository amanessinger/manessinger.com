Same place as yesterday, same wind turbines. I didn't expect to take such images at all. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131117_114856_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131117_114856_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The weather forecast had predicted high-altitude fog and sunshine had seemed to be an impossible dream.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20131117_114510_lr_plain.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20131117_114510_lr_plain.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> While I stood there, the fog moved quickly. One of my images turned out to be completely white, because I couldn't decide upon the exact framing, and while I shifted the camera and finally found my composition, the fog suddenly turned dense. 

Again, wind turbines are not normally seen as objects of beauty, but here the fog has taken away almost all context and I could as well have been on an alien planet.

 The Song of the Day is again "Sunrise Of The Planetary Dream Collector" from the Kronos Quartet's 1984 recording of Terry Riley's "Cadenza on the Night Plain". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1hLjdaUhMI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
