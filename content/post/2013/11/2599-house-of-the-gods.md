From now on and at least for the foreseeable future all images on this blog will be from the OM-D E-M1, and at least for the next weeks I'll use the 12-40/2.8 exclusively. I want to find out if that zoom is for me or if I want to sell it.

The battery grip for the E-M5 is already gone. I've obviously sold it too cheap, but on the other hand, the rubber on the "landscape" grip, the only part that I've ever used, was beginning to seriously peel away. Easy to fix but taking away from resell value.

The Olympus 60/2.8 macro lens is gone as well. It is a stellar lens, but I hardly used it at all. I threw in the Macro Arm Light MAL-1, because I doubt I ever had an even less used accessory.

An ad for the OM-D E-M5 has already been placed, and I guess although the price for the Nikon D300 is very low now, I'll sell it next. 

I may also decide to pass the 12-40/2.8 on, because for Micro Four Thirds this is a big and heavy lens. But then, today I picked up the D300 with the Tamron 17-50/2.8, and compared to that, my new camera feels small and light.

Whatever I'll finally do, for the time being I'll keep the lens. I've even bought a cheap Samsonite camera bag with space for just the E-M1 and possibly two other lenses. Together with 9-18 and 40-150 I'd have a light travel kit that covers all focal lengths and is even moderately fast where I need it most.

 The Image of the Day is of a window of a small church on a hill over Villach. I was there yesterday, enjoying the bright sun and being annoyed by the icy wind. Well, you can't have it all at this time of the year, I guess ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/p/pogues/house_of_the_gods.html" target="_blank">House Of The Gods</a>" from the 1990 Pogues album "Hell's Ditch". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtu_IM6cN1o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
