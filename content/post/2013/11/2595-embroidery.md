This is an image that I've taken before. In fact I take something like this at least once a year - at this time of the year. And it always reminds me of precious embroidery. 

 "Embroidery", the first piece on Terry Riley's live improvisation from the album "Songs for the Ten Voices of the Two Prophets" is the Song of the Day. 

It has always fascinated me since I bought the vinyl album in the early 1980s, and because I have no turntable any more, I have not heard it in a long time. Now it's back, now you can get much of Riley's work as digital downloads, and I'm sure I'll look deeper into it soon. Unfortunately it's not yet on YouTube. Hear "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNiAvFzYUS8" target="_blank">Eastern Man</a>" from the same album instead.
