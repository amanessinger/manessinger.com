I took more than one image from this point of view, trying to place the lines as exactly into the corners as possible. This would have been one of the best attempts at what I've been up to, if only, if only ... that man wouldn't have entered the frame. 

 My first impulse was to throw the image away, but then I realized that this ghost is in a perfect spot to balance an otherwise unbalanced image.

The Song of the Day is "Mr. Ghost Goes To Town" by Tommy Dorsey. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_YJQ1IQAcg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
