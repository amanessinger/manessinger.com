We had a few cold and very rainy days and what are you supposed to take images of on such a day? Well, one option is to wait until night falls, drive to the next supermarket, stay in the car, let the rain splash on your windshield and take abstract images.

 Here I've used manual focus and the 45/1.8. Longer lenses give you more options to get abstract, more rain also helps ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/suzanne_vega/night_vision.html" target="_blank">Night Vision</a>" from Suzanne Vega's 1987 album "Solitude Standing". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbbAGKvC2Gk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
