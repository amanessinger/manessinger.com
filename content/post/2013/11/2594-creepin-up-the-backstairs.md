It's not a posh neighborhood where I live in Vienna, but honestly, I couldn't care less. Industrial decay is a style that I've always liked in games like Unreal Tournament, and really, this looks a little bit like the result of a game level designer gone mad. 

Down at the bottom level, in the most dangerous spot where the light is brightest, we would position the highest level pickup, possibly a Big Keg'o'Health or maybe a mighty weapon. The tree is in a slighty unfortunate position though, because it hurts the flow on the second level ðŸ™‚

 And up the stairs? Of course there must be a sniper gun somewhere. 

Hmm ... but then, at a time when you find out that your heroes are killers, liers and fascists, at a time when you find out that democracy does not even exist, and that wars for economic dominance are fought under the pretense of fighting terrorism, first-person shooter games acquire a bitter taste.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/the_fratellis/creepin_up_the_backstairs.html" target="_blank">Creepin Up The Backstairs</a>" from the 2007 Fratellis album "Costello Music".
