In a way I was afraid of leaving Vienna's bustling 7<sup>th</sup> district and moving out to where I live and work now. And it's obvious, this is not a photographer's paradise of small and smallest shops and of busy people any more. This is suburbia, the realm of concrete and of cars, of shopping malls and of big apartment blocks. This is a totally different world.

 It's not less interesting to take images though. It's different, that's all.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/emmylou_harris_rodney_crowell/here_we_are_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Here We Are</a>" from "Old Yellow Moon", the 2013 collaboration of Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfmMMhVsXRw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
