Ok, here's one more I have to share. Same place behind our house, behind the fence with the shovel. I like it how strong colors are still pushing through, at least until next time ðŸ™‚

 Like always at this time of the year, the Song of the Day is "First Snow In Kokomo" from Aretha Franklin's 1972 landmark album "Young, Gifted And Black". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lWEipcCVHA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
