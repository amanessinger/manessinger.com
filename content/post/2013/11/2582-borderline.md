I guess you can see from my current images that we have bad weather over here. Not as bad as elsewhere (all my best wishes to those hit by Haiyan), thus to complain would be frivolous.

 Of course now <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/04/potential_senate_candidate_david_barton_explains_how_abortion_caused_climate_change/" target="_blank">even the most skeptic have understood that climate change is man made</a>. The linked video has been taken offline for copyright reasons, but of course it's all over <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-82yNY9hNl0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. No further comments.

The Song of the Day is "Borderline" by Amanda Jenssen. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1YxZ8Blm4Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
