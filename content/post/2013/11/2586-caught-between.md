This metal framework was recently built at a construction site near my home in Vienna. It is obviously meant to hold the floor of an overhanging part of the building while it is being built.

 The Song of the Day is "Caught Between" from Brian Eno's 2005 album "Another Day on Earth". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pzmKzfdAkk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
