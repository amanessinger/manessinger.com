What's that, you ask? I have no idea, I say. I just saw these tubes in front of a shop in Villach. Obviously some kind of construction was going on, but then, these tubes look in a way irregular, that the building blocks of our industrial age almost never look. Made me tilt my head, shrug my shoulders and go on ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "`EungenioÂ´ Salvador DalÃ­" from the classic Mecano album "Descanso Dominical". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVg2Lnc5tQg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
