The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/leonard_cohen/memories.html" target="_blank">Memories</a>" from Leonard Cohen's much under-appreciated cooperation with Phil Spector, "Death Of A Ladies' Man". See it in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USWLHcRIdBU" target="_blank">a clip</a> from the short movie "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USWLHcRIdBU" target="_blank">I am a hotel</a>".
