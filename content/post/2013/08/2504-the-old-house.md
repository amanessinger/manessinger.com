Here's again an image from a short trip to Croatia. You'll see a few more soon.

Again this image has been taken with the 17/1.8. I have not used the Panasonic 25/1.4 in weeks, and in the meantime it has really been sold. The price I got was slightly less than expected, but I guess this just reflects the economic situation. Recovery is already there, though people are still not spending as easily as before the crisis.

 The Song of the Day is "The Old House" from Marianne Faithfull's 2011 album "Horses and High Heels". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZKcfkMXmA4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
