I've already used that title a long time ago in "<a href="/2012/01/1926-all-down-the-line.html" target="_blank">1926 â€“ All Down The Line</a>", today I use it again and so I will tomorrow. The red line in this image is the border of an advertising poster mounted on a metal fence.

I like big ads on the street. They are colorful, and when I go near with a wide lens, I can explore countless worlds, just by cutting out details and using the wide-angle distortions to my advantage. 

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/all_down_the_line.html" target="_blank">All Down The Line</a>" from "Exile On Main Street", one of the best Rolling Stones albums of all times. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtAsaDKB0eY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
