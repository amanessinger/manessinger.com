Well, here they are back again, the tilt and the bicycles. I'm sure you missed 'em ðŸ™‚

 I took the image in the evening below an Underground station (actually very much above ground level), when the sun had already gone down so low and when the shadows were long. OK, talk about a stretched connection to a title ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is Cyndi Lauper's "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/linda_ronstadt/down_so_low.html" target="_blank">Down So Low</a>" from her 2010 album "Memphis Blues". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcLy0O2U938" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
