This is a detail of a door on the street. I walk by whenever I go from work to the Underground, i.e. roughly once a week.

I've seen it a few times, it already caught my attention, but only now did I bother to actually take an image.

 This happens very often. I always scan my environment, and if I don't do it consciously, my sub-conscious nevertheless does. Some things cause immediate action, some only get "on the list", but having something on the list makes immediate action much more likely the next time.

The Song of the Day is "Rough Cut Diamond" by Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV0DDbgT090" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
