These roots at the shore of the lake where I usually swim reminded me of bones, especially with the reflection and its symmetry. It was a sunny day but the roots were in the shade and I decided for a more sinister look.

 Now that I think of it, there are probably some more things that can be done and I may try a variant for the next post. Just give me some time ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/madeleine_peyroux/bare_bones.html" target="_blank">Bare Bones</a>" from Madeleine Peyroux' 2010 album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ETjfzAYsn4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
