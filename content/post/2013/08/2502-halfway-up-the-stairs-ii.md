My honeymoon with the Olympus 9-18 is more or less over, it's just one of my lenses now. Still, at times it is convenient to have the lens mounted, even if the focal length would be available from other, higher quality lenses in my bag.

 Today's image for example has been taken at 12&nbsp;mm, a focal length that I've covered by an expensive and beautiful prime, the Olympus 12/2.0. 

Would there have been a difference? Hardly at f8. The prime might have been a smidge sharper and for maximum print sizes it may matter. Here, on the web, the difference is negligible.

The Song of the Day is again "Halfway Up The Stairs" by Sixto Rodriguez, taken from his second album "Coming from Reality". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6MLOGZtiv4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
