I see this construction site behind the Underground station (well, forget about the "under" part out here in the outskirts of Vienna) every time I head for the train to Carinthia. Somehow the portal-like view impresses me.

 It's not a classically beautiful place, but it breathes a certain power. And it's one of those non-places that are so much part of our everyday life and that we tend to disregard anyway. It's only somewhere in between, but that doesn't make it less interesting for me.

The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/somewhere_in_between.html" target="_blank">Somewhere In Between</a>" from Kate Bush’s 2005 album “Aerial”. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HiDZ1MqWo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
