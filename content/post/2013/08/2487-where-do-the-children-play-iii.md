I've had an image of this <a href="/2012/01/1901-wooden-horse.html" target="_blank">wooden horse</a> in winter, more than a year ago, but still, every time I see it, I get furious over what some people's idea of a playground is. Even though the place looks substantially bigger due to the extreme wide-angle distortions, it still looks small.

 Well, you know how big a toy horse is, how big a fence and how small flowers are. That's a lot of distortion! In reality it's a narrow strip of grass between the private road through our housing complex and the fence. The building housing the garbage containers to the right and the electric post to the left have been omitted. Oh dear!

The Song of the Day is again Cat Stevens' "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dolly_parton/where_do_the_children_play.html" target="_blank">Where Do The Children Play</a>", interpreted by Dolly Parton. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyNVw3Yja3U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
