In German we call these fluffy clouds "SchÃ¤fchenwolken", "sheep clouds" or actually lamb clouds. I like the expression for its implied cuddliness and it goes well with the fact that they usually mean fair weather ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130812_113624_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130812_113624_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Just that was the case here. The image with the cranes has been taken at noon, the other in late afternoon, when I was on my way to the underground station.

 The weather had held, it was still sunny and the veil of those clouds, although denser, made for interesting images.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cake/sheep_go_to_heaven.html" target="_blank">Sheep Go To Heaven</a>" from the 1998 Cake album "Prolonging The Magic". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbnT7ciDXSM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
