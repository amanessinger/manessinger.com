It's incredibly easy to please with a wide-angle, but as much as I like to use ultra-wides, the lens that I turn to most often these days is the 17/1.8. I still have not sold the 25/1.4, but hopefully by the time you read this, it'll be gone for good. 

I have no idea why it would be so, but the traditional normal lens is not my "normal" any more. A moderately wide lens, the equivalent of the traditional 35&nbsp;mm "street lens" has become "normal" to me.

 The Song of the Day is "When The Sun Sets Down South" by Sidney Bechet. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSyB1wfk_6A" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
