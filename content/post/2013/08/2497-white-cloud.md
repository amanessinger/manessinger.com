A cloud and the shadow of a tree, looking almost as if they'd belong to each other. It's easy to construct that kind of images with a wide lens. You still need some material to work with though ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day is "White Cloud", a meditative saxophone piece from Jan Garbarek's 1979 album "Photo With Blue Sky, White Cloud, Wires, Windows And A Red Roof". It was a different time, a time when it was possible to make slow movies and slow music. Both are pretty rare now, especially the movies.

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwH64Jmiv4U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
