Did I ever say I love taking images with the sun in my frame? If not, yes, I do ðŸ™‚

 Summer mornings! I'd really had no objections against endless summers, but in reality it's already fading. The sun does not rise impossibly early any more, although on the plus side this gives even me the option to take sunrise images ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "New Morning" from Bob Dylan's 1970 album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQUvezM3D3E" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
