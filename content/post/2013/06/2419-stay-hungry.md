Reading this post's title may make you think of the 1974 Whole Earth Catalog's farewell message "Stay hungry, stay foolish", made famous by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc" target="_blank">Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address</a>, but here I mean it in a much more literal sense.

 The message on the blackboard reads "Kitchen closed for renovation / No food". Nothing will keep you from being foolish though ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/talking_heads/stay_hungry.html" target="_blank">Stay Hungry</a>" from the 1978 Talking Heads album "More Songs About Buildings And Food". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_o_2P6TYAk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
