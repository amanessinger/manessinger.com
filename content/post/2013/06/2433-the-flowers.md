Nice neighbors recently brought us these beautiful flowers as an unexpected present, and also unexpectedly I ended up with the job of taking an image of them. The flowers, not the neighbors ðŸ˜„

 If you look carefully, you can see where I have taken the image: on the glass ceramic cooktop in our kitchen. They are lit by indirect natural light and it took me two attempts in Lightroom to get colors and contrasts right. Well, what I consider "right" anyway ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/regina_spektor/the_flowers.html" target="_blank">The Flowers</a>" from Regina Spektor's 2004 album "Soviet Kitsch". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otkRjlEh9kY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
