Sorry for that, but I just had to bother you once again with Venetian gondole. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130612_124544_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130612_124544_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> They are everywhere and, yes, it's kitsch, but sometimes kitsch is OK. At least it's very original kitsch ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130612_124602_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130612_124602_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> When I began processing these images, I asked myself, what will I take images of when I am the next time in Venice? Still gondole? Won't I get tired of them? Won't you?

But then it occurred to me that I have taken images of cars and bicycles for years. Few have complained, some seem to like it and I did certainly not grow tired of them. As with everything, there's certainly more than one way to photograph a gondola.

 One more time the Song of the Day is "Corso Delle Gondole" from the 1987 RondÃ² Veneziano album "Misteriosa Venezia". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd0oKxvI95U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
