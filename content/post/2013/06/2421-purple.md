This bike stands in Villach in front of a shop having only purple goods. That's an interesting business model, but it seems to work. At least I have seen the shop for two or three years now ðŸ™‚

In the meantime I have cataloged the whole year 2011 in Lightroom. All images published on my blog in the last two and a half year are also <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/" target="_blank">on Flickr now - in full size</a>. 

 Let's see, I began this blog in 2006, that means I have only five more years to catalog, and then ... oh dammit, that's depressing! Anyway. Progress is slow, but that was to be expected. Given my spare time I am surprised that there is any progress at all ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is the Tom Waits composition "Purple Avenue", interpreted by Holly Cole on her 1993 album "Blame It On My Youth". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6UEsecSlPo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
