This is one more image made with my cheapest lens, the plastic mount Olympus 40-150 zoom, the only zoom that I still own, the zoom that I bought used for nothing and was already willing to pass on for less. 

No way!

 I'm in Carinthia now; in fact I have been since Wednesday evening. Weather is much better here. This image for instance was taken yesterday morning, and today it was sunny almost all day as well. I'm off from work for a week now. No fixed plans, we'll just see what feels good and what the weather allows ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/arcade_fire/deep_blue.html" target="_blank">Deep Blue</a>" from the 2011 Arcade Fire album "The Suburbs". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDIRT_NEMxo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
