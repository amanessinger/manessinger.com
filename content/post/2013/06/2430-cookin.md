Among the things that troubled Stefan Zweig, one of the worst was the helplessness of the average citizen against the decisions of a few select (and definitely not wise) men. 

 Hitler, Chamberlain, Daladier, Mussolini, those were the few who decided about the fate of millions, and regardless of who you were and what your merits were, you had no saying when it came to war or peace, life or death.

 And it didn't get better since then. The pretenses have changed, the world has become superficially more democratic, but in the end it's all the same: we are the ingredients of a soup cooked by other people.

The Song of the Day is "Cookin'" by Clifford Brown. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0KQrxXZPNo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
