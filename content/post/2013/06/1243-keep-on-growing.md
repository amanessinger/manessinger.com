This car is for sale, obviously it has been so for a while, and I suppose it will be so for quite a while longer ðŸ™‚

 I've seen this car near the place where I work and live now. Most of my co-workers seem to hate the neighborhood, partly because they have much longer commutes now, partly for the factual and undeniable lack of conventional aesthetic values. While I also had doubts about its value as a photo hunting ground, I see now, that I need not worry. It's not worse, it's only different. I suppose I'll get along quite well ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/derek_and_the_dominos/keep_on_growing.html" target="_blank">Keep On Growing</a>" from the classic Derek &amp; The Dominos album "Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs".
