This is typically Venetian architecture. I suppose you can't call it a palace, but it was (and is) undeniably the residence of a wealthy person. Today the front entrance facing the canal will only occasionally be opened, in those rare cases when the boat is used. Times have changed.

 The Song of the Day, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/d/dolly_parton/behind_closed_doors.html" target="_blank">Behind Closed Doors</a>" from Dolly Parton's 1996 album "Treasures", has already been used in "<a href="/2009/12/1162-behind-closed-doors.html" target="_blank">1162 â€“ Behind Closed Doors</a>", but that's fine for me. Hope you don't mind either ðŸ™‚
