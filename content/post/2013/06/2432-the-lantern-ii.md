This is a lantern above the portal to a church in Vienna. I suppose it is not old, at least not that old. Maybe a few hundred years?

Of course it would have been outfitted electrically within the last century, maybe less than that, but it's hard to tell. Everything is old around here and if things are not, a lot of effort is put into keeping up the illusion ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day has already been in use in "<a href="/2009/08/1029-lantern.html" target="_blank">1029 â€“ The Lantern</a>". Hey, that was in August 2009, and wow, that's a long time ago as well ðŸ™‚

"<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rolling_stones/the_lantern.html" target="_blank">The Lantern</a>" is from the 1967 Rolling Stones album "Their Satanic Majesties Request". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4Bn0FvChY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
