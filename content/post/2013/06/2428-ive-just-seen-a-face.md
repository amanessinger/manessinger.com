I've been doing these pre-scheduled posts for almost two weeks now, always scheduling for 8pm local time, and I can tell you that I like it. Yes, it takes away spontaneity, it allows me to cheat and to use one day's images for a series of days (I'm just running such a batch taken on Friday), but it also takes out the stress. 

Here is the first of two images taken on a playground in Villach. This was some kind of riding device, what you see is a face, probably a stylized bear.

 The Song of the Day is "I've Just Seen A Face" from the 1965 Beatles album "Help". Hear it on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J54Iec7QnxQ">YouTube</a>.
