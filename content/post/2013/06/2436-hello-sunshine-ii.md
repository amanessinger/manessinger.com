Here's another image taken in Venice. Well, it could have been almost any Italian city, no water, no canals, no specifically Venetian architecture in sight, but that's something of a plus: When you're there, you get everything Venice is famous for, and additionally you get all the typical beauty of Italian cities - for free. This image is from the bonus side ðŸ˜„

 The hot sun on warm walls, that has fascinated me ever since childhood, certainly long before I began taking photographs. Cozy human settlements, embedded in a rich and friendly nature. Yes, I know, there are volcanoes and earth quakes in Italy, but may I dream my dream of an ideal mediterranean idyll? Pretty please?

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/aretha_franklin/hello_sunshine.html" target="_blank">Hello Sunshine</a>" from the 1968 Aretha Franklin album "Aretha Now". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWo7kvVBEgY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
