Last week I've taken a day trip to Venice. It's just little more than two hours by car from Carinthia, five hours from Vienna. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130612_112017_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130612_112017_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> OK, from Vienna it's too far for a day trip, but from Carinthia it was perfectly fine.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130612_112738_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130612_112738_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's funny, I haven't been there in many years, and certainly these are my first images of Venice. Pretty stupid, I know, I ought to be there a couple of times a year, and after this experience, first time in Venice with a camera, I suppose I will come back very soon.

Today's images were taken from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporetto" target="_blank">Vaporetto</a>, Venice's closest equivalent to a bus. From where I sat, I was very restricted as to viewing angles, but it really does not matter. Just point your camera in any direction, subject matter is guaranteed ðŸ™‚

 "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_sinatra/i_cover_the_waterfront_lyrics.html" target="_blank">I Cover The Waterfront</a>", the Song of the Day, was already used a few times on this blog, but I guess I didn't have the Sinatra version so far. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4PqkT22_aQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
