Weather conditions have been quite extreme lately. We've had unusually cold and wet weather for most of May, but what a difference was it last week!

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130620_160443_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130620_160443_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Heat records were broken, that had held since the beginning of scientific meteorology - and I deeply enjoyed it!

For only the second time this year I went swimming, and these images were taken on my somewhat circuitous way to the lake.

 The Song of the Day is "Sway" from Vanessa Carlton's 2002 album "Be Not Nobody". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zPYayheccY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
