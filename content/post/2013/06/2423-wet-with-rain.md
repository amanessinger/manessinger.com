Central Europe is pretty much drowning in rain at the moment, with flooding and enormous damage along the big rivers. Eleven years ago we had a "once-in-a-century" flood, and this time it's worse.

Neither Villach (or any part of Carinthia) nor Vienna have been struck. In Villach it is due to a less vulnerable geography (although we had serious flooding in 1966) and in Vienna it is due to ingenious artificial protection, realized by the Social Democratic government in the 1970s, against grim resistance of the Conservative party. Well, sometimes socialism just works ðŸ™‚

 This image has been taken in front of our old office building. It may well be one of the last images that I ever take at that place. Today I had my last working day in that building, next week I have taken off, and when I get back to work, it will already be on the other side ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is the beautiful "The Perfumed Forest Wet With Rain" from Abdullah Ibrahim's "Africa - Tears and Laughter". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vfkp5ISn1c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
