Or, wait, actually it's not. This is the shore of a small lake or rather a big pond in Vienna, near where I live now. The image still reminds me of a sea shore though ðŸ™‚

 If you follow my blog regularly, you may be surprised to see me posting daily again. Well, I tell you a secret: the posts of the past week were written in advance and then scheduled to be published one per day. It's less immediate, it does not allow me to react to events, but on the other hand it makes this so-called "daily" photoblog a lot more daily than it was in recent months ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/waterboys/this_is_the_sea.html" target="_blank">This Is The Sea</a>" from the 1985 Waterboys album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnU3Isc00yc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
