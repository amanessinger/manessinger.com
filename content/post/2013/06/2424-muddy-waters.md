Why do I make such an image, you ask? This image is not beautiful, you say?

Yes, yes, you're right, it ain't, still I do. It's not that I don't have enough "beautiful" material to draw from, it's more that I sometimes feel an urge to show things "as they are", another fallacy, but one that's widely accepted among photographers. 

 Of course it did look like that and it didn't at all. This image is restriction of an unbounded reality to the narrow bounds of a square, and it reduces a complex reality to a "yin-and-yang-ness" that the whole situation clearly didn't have. And then, what is a "whole situation" anyway?

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/v/vaya_con_dios/muddy_waters.html" target="_blank">Muddy Waters</a>" from the 1992 Vaya Con Dios album "Time Flies". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmkg1zFbMyI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
