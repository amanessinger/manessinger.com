Here are the two pictures that I've promised yesterday. It's the same trip, we had just reached the first of two mountain passes and had left the heavy shower behind, that had caught us on our way up. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130622_150255_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130622_150255_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> We stayed for a few moments, ate a "Bauernkrapfen", kind of a doughnut, I took some pictures, and then we rode on towards east, into the next rain.

 The Song of the Day is again "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/eddi_reader/wild_mountainside_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Wild Mountainside</a>" from Eddi Reader's "The Songs of Robert Burns". We've already had it in "<a href="/2008/05/566-wild-mountainside.html" target="_blank">566 â€“ Wild Mountainside</a>", but Eddi Reader and this kind of landscape, that can't possibly be wrong. See her live at the Scottish Parliament on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVHStNqksY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
