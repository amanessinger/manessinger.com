This is not a composite, though I can't say I haven't touched it heavily. I have greatly increased contrast and I have done so selectively, I have increased local contrast (aka "clarity"), added a lot of saturation, shifted blues more towards magenta, corrected perspective, cropped the image, removed an insect and, well, maybe some more things that escape me right now ðŸ™‚

 It's not a composite though. It's a reflection of the setting sun in a window of an Underground station, with a lamp behind the glass. Looks nicely surreal to me. Oh, and: no Photoshop. This has been done right in Lightroom 5.

The Song of the Day is the old Platters hit "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/the_platters/twilight_time.html" target="_blank">Twilight Time</a>". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvRe_pt9XHo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
