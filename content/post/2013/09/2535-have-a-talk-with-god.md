This is a confessional in the cathedral of San Miniato, a town in the hills west of Vinci. It struck me as a place of power and dominance. Certainly there is nothing humble to it ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130914_173827_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130914_173827_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The cathedral of San Miniato and the medieval tower erected for Emperor Frederic II in the 13<sup>th</sup> century were both blown up by retreating Nazi forces in 1944, a hideous war crime, especially because the cathedral was full of people seeking refuge. Interestingly enough neither the German nor the English Wikipedia pages mention the event, usually referred to as "<a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strage_del_Duomo_di_San_Miniato" target="_blank">La strage del Duomo di San Miniato</a>".

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130914_173102_lr_plain.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130914_173102_lr_plain.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The tower of Frederic was reconstructed in 1958, and from there I have taken the image to the right.

The image on the left side was taken from the platform at the foot of the tower.

There was a wedding in progress and we only saw it from the outside. Maybe next time. I'm sure I won't take another 23 years until Mario and I meet again ðŸ™‚

 The Somg of the Day is "Have A Talk With God" from Stevie Wonder's 1976 album "Songs In The Key Of Life", maybe his best album ever. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbzcdG5FK3c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
