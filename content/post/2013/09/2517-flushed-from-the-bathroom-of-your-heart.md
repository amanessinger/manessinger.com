This is the same place as in the last two posts. The image has been taken on a bright, sunny day, but here we look into the door at the center of yesterday's image, a small, narrow room with a toilet in the back, all black with soot. 

 I've used a long lens in order to not cast a shadow, and although I've used the fast Olympus 75/1.8, I had to go to f8 and ISO 1600 to have enough depth of field. Well, my fault, with the OM-D's great stabilization I would have been able to hold 1/30&nbsp;s, and that would have allowed me to shoot only slightly over base ISO. On the other hand, ISO 1600 on this camera is perfectly usable, so I just stop whining ðŸ™‚
