Don't ask me what made me choose this image as an Image of the Day or even what made me take the image in the first place. I don't know. Something just spoke to me.

This is a courtyard with shops, situated in a housing complex a few streets from where I live and work now. Cheap architecture, maybe around twenty years old, already shabby, and still, there is some smallness of the shops that you don't find any more, along with the coziness given by the tree, and all that together makes me like that place in a way that's hard to explain.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/los_lobos/the_giving_tree.html" target="_blank">The Giving Tree</a>" from the 1990 Los Lobos album "The Neighborhood". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqLn1kW16hI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
