Here's one last image from those industrial ruins in Villach. Using the. Olympus 9-18, I took the image against the light, almost routinely, not expecting anything. 

 In post-processing it turned out quite well though, well enough in fact, that I use it as a wallpaper on my laptop now. As always, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/9658528938/sizes/o/" target="_blank">full size</a> in on Flickr.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/talking_heads/life_during_wartime.html" target="_blank">Life During Wartime</a>" from the 1979 Talking Heads album "Fear of Music". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DblvhECdws0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Unfortunately what is artistic fiction for me, is harsh reality for millions of people in less fortunate places.
