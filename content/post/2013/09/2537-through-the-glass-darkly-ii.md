This is an image taken in an Underground station in Vienna, in the middle of the night, right after my arrival.

 I like the ambiguity introduced by the multiple reflections in the glass casing of the elevator cage. You certainly have seen similar images on this blog in the past, but it never fails to fascinate me again. Please bear with me anyway ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/annie_lennox/through_the_glass_darkly.html" target="_blank">Through The Glass Darkly</a>" from Annie Lennox' 2007 album "Songs Of Mass Destruction".
