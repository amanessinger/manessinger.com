There were times when this door was painted, times when the glass would have been repaired, times when the newspaper would have been removed. Not any more. It's all over, everything has ended.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/a/ana_gabriel/todo_termino.html" target="_blank">Todo termino</a>" from Ana Gabriel's 1992 album "Silueta". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dv3-fUF1uM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
