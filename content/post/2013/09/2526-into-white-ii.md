I took this image more than a week ago. It was morning and there was already a feeling of autumn in the air. The grass was wet with dew and the sun was glistening. It gave the white flowers an almost radiant quality, and to me it gave the strong urge to take an image.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/c/cat_stevens/into_white.html" target="_blank">Into White</a>" from Cat Stevens' 1970 album "Tea for the Tillerman", a song that I have already used in "<a href="/2013/01/2285-into-white.html" target="_blank">2285 â€“ Into White</a>", then for a completely different image and mood.

Hear the song on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBDJ12u4tGY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
