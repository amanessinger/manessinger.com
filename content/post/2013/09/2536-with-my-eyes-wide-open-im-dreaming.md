Right now I'm sitting on the train back to Vienna, preparing another bunch of blog posts to be published during the next week, and while I think about this particular image, I contemplate my way of seeing and of taking photographs.

Well, you know, I don't do this to make a living. I may consider much of what I do as art, but it is not recognized in the Art world. Nobody knows me but a few friends who visit my blog more or less regularly.

And that's OK.

I do this for me. Seeing, dreaming, creating, that has always been a part of me. For a long time I didn't understand what this means, and often I found myself in turmoil, being torn between my two vocations, engineering and art. Not so any more. Now I know that this process of letting go of my daily troubles, of immersing myself in pure images, of dreaming myself into a completely different world, that this process is what keeps my mind sane. Well, at least I hope so ðŸ˜„

 Today's image, taken in San Miniato, was pretty daunting. I was fascinated by the dreamy pattern of dappled light, but somehow it didn't come across. In such a case there is normally the point when I try a conversion to black and white. Usually I do it manually, but this time the Lightroom preset "Infrared" did exactly what I was after.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/natalie_cole/with_my_eyes_wide_open_im_dreaming.html" target="_blank">With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming</a>" from Natalie Cole's 1999 album "Snowfall On The Sahara".
