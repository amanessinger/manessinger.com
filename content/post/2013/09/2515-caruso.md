Does this image look at least vaguely expressionist to you? Would an association with "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrg73BUxJLI" target="_blank">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a>" seem at least plausible? 

 Well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Caruso" target="_blank">Enrico Caruso</a> was the most famous tenor of that time, "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lucio_dalla/caruso.html" target="_blank">Caruso</a>" is the biggest hit Lucio Dalla ever wrote, and a duet between Dalla and Luciano Pavarotti, one of the most famous tenors of our time, is my Song of the Day. See them on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRGuFM4DR2Y" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Now you know the weird ways of my thoughts ðŸ™‚
