A new supermarket has opened in the block where I work, but really, supermarket is the wrong word. This is no market, it is just a big shop that tries hard to have something in every category that you could wish for. A market is something different. A market is a place with many small, independent shops. 

I don't mean a mall either. Though malls are maybe closest to what markets once were, the malls of today are too big and too expensive. Only the big chains can afford to be there, and that's the reason why all malls look the same.

Markets are what we wish for and don't buy in. That's why they vanish and why we're left in misery with malls and supermarkets. Markets are a thing of the past.

 This fence is where once there was a market. It has long since closed and some development company has cleared the ground and fenced it in. Now they wait for the day to make the most of their investment. Advertisement posters get affixed and are torn down again. Time passes.

The Song of the Day is "Disguises" from the 1980 album "Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzL8YFQGfgM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
