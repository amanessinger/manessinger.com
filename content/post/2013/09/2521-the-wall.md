Here's one last image from Monfalcone, and if you ask me, this one does not look so unattractive at all. Who wouldn't want to lean against that wall and enjoy the late-summer sun?

 We already had "Live At Folsom Prison" a few posts ago. Today's Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/j/johnny_cash/the_wall.html" target="_blank">The Wall</a>", again from that album. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_MjWtJN5T4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
