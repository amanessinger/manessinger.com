<blockquote><em>So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. You do not follow maps to buried treasure and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.</em></blockquote>

With this classic quote from "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" I begin a new series of images ðŸ™‚

 Originally I wanted to call the post "'X' never, ever, marks the spot" and use the soundtrack as Song of the Day, but then, tentatively searching for a song with "X" in its title, I stumbled upon "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/blondie/x_offender.html" target="_blank">X Offender</a>" by Blondie. Well, I've always liked the cool brilliance of Debbie's voice and I immediately fell in love again. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xbzVtZM9c" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
