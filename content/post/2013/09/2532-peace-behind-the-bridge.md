I said Mario lives in Vinci, and although that's technically correct in terms of postal addresses, he really lives in the hills above Vinci, and in order to reach him, you have to drive a steep, narrow, winding country road, but first you have to cross this bridge.

 Tuscany is famous for its ancient bridges, and although this is not one of them, for a photographer like me it's still a nice sight as far as bridges go.

The Song of the Day is "Peace Behind The Bridge" from the 2010 Carolina Chocolate Drops album "Genuine Negro Jig". See a live performance on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy6j_VmNwM4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
