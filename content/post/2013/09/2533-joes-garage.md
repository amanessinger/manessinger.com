Well, Mario's actually ðŸ™‚

When we arrived at his home around noon the next day, first thing we did was sit down and ask ourselves why we've never met the past 23 years. I had brought along some prints as a present, thus photography and my blog were a topic, and while we talked, I always saw the pattern of light and shadows on the old corrugated metal door. After a while I couldn't resist any more and took this image.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/f/frank_zappa/joes_garage_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Joe's Garage</a>", the title song of one of Frank Zappa's best albums. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oH8u9PxWJo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
