I've never been to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monfalcone" target="_blank">Monfalcone</a> before. It's a small industrial city in northern Italy, one of those typical places that you always drive by and never visit.

 Well, I did, and now I know why it's not considered a "sight". The city was at the heart of World War I's Isonzo battles, and during World War II it was heavily bombed in 1944. There is really hardly anything left of pre-war architecture. The day was not wasted though. I've learned a few things, taken a few images anyway, and at least it was sunny and warm while cool rains washed over Carinthia.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/smiths/reel_around_the_fountain.html" target="_blank">Reel Around The Fountain</a>" from the 1984 Smiths album "Hatful Of Hollow". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuWZEhbe8x8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
