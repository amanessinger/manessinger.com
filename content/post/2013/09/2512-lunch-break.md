I took this image while sitting on the terrace around noon, watching the pattern of light and shadow cast by the cheap wooden table, delighted by the warmth of one of the last hot days in August. 

 I already knew that it wouldn't stay that way, that summer would give way to fall, but at this moment it was still there in all its glory. Now that I write about it, only four days later, I am on the train, crossing cold and rainy Alps, hoping that by the time you read this, we'll be getting a few more, a few last sunny days.

The Song of the Day is "Lunch Break" from the classic 1967 Moody Blues album "Days Of Future Passed". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djX1pjS-E1M" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
