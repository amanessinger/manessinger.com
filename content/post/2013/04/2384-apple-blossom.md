On Saturday, along with the weekend, came clouds and some rain. I didn't mind though, I had enough to do anyway and I even found time to take a portrait of this tree. I am pretty sure it is an apple tree, but I don't know for sure.

 The image was taken with the ultra-sharp 75/1.8, a lens that I definitely don't use as much as it deserves.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/w/white_stripes/apple_blossom.html" target="_blank">Apple Blossom</a>" from the 2008 White Stripes album "De Stijl". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KX7NRFYQa4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
