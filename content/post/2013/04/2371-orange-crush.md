It's Sunday and I am on the train back to Vienna. This is an image taken yesterday under a highway bridge.

Graffiti are always interesting, because they don't have regular borders, they are not strictly rectangular, they are made to blend into each other. This their very nature makes it so rewarding to just take a crop, look for pictures in the picture, patterns in the pattern.

 I probably should have used this beautiful Sunday to go out and make images, but instead I've lain naked on our roof terrace, enjoying the hot sun and reading the first chapters of Jack Vance's "The Green Pearl", the second part of his "Lyonesse" trilogy.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/rem/orange_crush.html" target="_blank">Orange Crush</a>" from the 1988 R.E.M. album "Green". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mSmOcmk7uQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
