The man on this bleached out poster is our chancellor. He's got some color here, because I took everything out of his surrounding. That's exactly how it is in real life ðŸ™‚

 The Song for Friday is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/regina_spektor/ballad_of_a_politician.html" target="_blank">Ballad Of A Politician</a>" by Regina Spektor. Hear it on her perfectly named album "What We Saw From The Cheap Seats" or for getting the taste hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnYDuKSzQpM" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
