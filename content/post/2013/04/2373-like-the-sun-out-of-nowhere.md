Here's the post for last Tuesday, by chance with an image taken on Tuesday as well ðŸ™‚

 We had some sunny days last week and winter is finally over. 

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/randy_crawford/like_the_sun_out_of_nowhere.html" target="_blank">Like The Sun Out Of Nowhere</a>", a composition by Italian blues and rock singer Zucchero Fornaciari, sung by Randy Crawford, taken from her 1992 album "Through the Eyes of Love". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetWKSTQHBA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
