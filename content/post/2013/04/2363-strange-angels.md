This is the second image taken Saturday afternoon, this time for Saturday's post. Both images show the same stack of snow poles that we've seen a year ago in "<a href="/2012/03/1978-winterwood-ii.html" target="_blank">1978 â€“ Winterwood II</a>", only this time the images were taken with a macro lens.

 And really, when you go near enough, you may even see strange angels where you'd have expected only painted wood.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/laurie_anderson/strange_angels.html" target="_blank">Strange Angels</a>" by Laurie Anderson. Take it from the 1989 album of the same name or from her post-9/11 album "Live in New York". Both are great. Hear the album version on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQ-Al7ijk4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
