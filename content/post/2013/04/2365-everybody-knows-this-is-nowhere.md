This is part of the apartment complex where I live now in Vienna. It's not the most flattering of views (while in fact this is one of the best apartment complexes that I've seen in a long while), but when I saw this yellow needle in front of architecture and blue sky, I simply had to take the picture.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130409_072049_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130409_072049_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The other image is of a mail box somewhere near where I (still) work. I have no idea what the writer meant, but if you're interested, just google it yourself ðŸ™‚

 The Song of the Day (Monday, to be precise) is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/neil_young/everybody_knows_this_is_nowhere.html" target="_blank">Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</a>" from the Neil Young album of the same name. I just bought it and can heartily recommend it. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pesIGuV9DDk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
