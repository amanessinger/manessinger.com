Less than two weeks ago we had the last snow, but spring is here with might. The Image of the Day was taken yesterday in the forest under a highway bridge in Villach. I've been there to take images of graffiti, but I could impossibly ignore the flowers that have sprung up in the last few days.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130413_141140_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130413_141140_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The second image is of a cemetery wall in a village near Villach. I like the contrast between barren twigs and newborn flowers.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="Spring Will Be A Little Late This Year" target="_blank">Spring Will Be A Little Late This Year</a>" from the 1962 collaboration of Anita O'Day and Cal Tjader on their album "Time For Two". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0_-GeFUX2s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
