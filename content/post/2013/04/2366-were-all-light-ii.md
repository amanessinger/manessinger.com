What makes something beautiful? I think this house is, at least in the way I show you here. It is ugly because it was built by a bank and its apartment floor plans are not made for people, they are made for profit. I know, I have seen them, I was disgusted. But still, painted in late-afternoon light, with a reflection of sun and sky in its windows, it lifts my spirits.

 Today is Thursday night and this is the image for Tuesday. I am late as always, but tired as I am, this will be the last post for tonight. Likely ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/x/xtc/were_all_light.html" target="_blank">We're All Light</a>" from the 2000 XTC album "Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2)". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZTrRGLxBhs" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
