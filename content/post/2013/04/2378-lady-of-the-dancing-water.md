Sunday I went to a park in Villach and took images of the water in a fountain. Many of them or even more. In some cases I did not move the camera at all, just snapping away, and although it is hardly surprising, it nevertheless fascinates me how completely different successive images are.

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/king_crimson/lady_of_the_dancing_water.html" target="_blank">Lady Of The Dancing Water</a>" from the 1970 King Crimson album "Lizard". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7NxMgRmzog" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
