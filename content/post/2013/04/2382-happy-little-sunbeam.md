The weekend is over, I'm on the train back to Vienna, and as always lately, I use the time to bring the blog up to date. Here we go with Thursday.

 While <a href="http://lightscrape.blogspot.co.at/2013/04/like-melting-snow-upon-some-craggy-hill.html" target="_blank">snow in Finland is still melting</a>, in Austria we've already had some summerly days. I've spent most of the time working and shopping, but that is also more fun on sunny days ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Happy Little Sunbeam" by Chet Baker. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbdXVUb_XMU" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
