It's remarkable how precise weather forecasts have become. This Easter weekend I'd have preferred slightly less precision though ğŸ™‚

 Saturday I stayed in-house, this image was taken from our terrace.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/x/xtc/easter_theatre.html" target="_blank">Easter Theatre</a>" from the 1999 XTC album "Apple Venus Volume 1". The album is still not available as digital downloads. I've complained about that in "<a href="/2010/03/1238-easter-theatre.html" target="_blank">1238 â€“ Easter Theatre</a>", so I guess we can leave it at that ğŸ˜„
