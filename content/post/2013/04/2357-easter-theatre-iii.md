For Easter we had planned to have dinner in a restaurant about 1000 meters above sea level. Well, we didn't. Although down here in Villach the snow gave way to rain, up there it must have snowed all through Sunday.

 This depressing image was taken through the car's windshield when I brought aluminium cans to the recycling container.

The Song of the Day is still "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/x/xtc/easter_theatre.html" target="_blank">Easter Theatre</a>" from the 1999 XTC album "Apple Venus Volume 1". We've already had it in "<a href="/2010/03/1238-easter-theatre.html" target="_blank">1238 â€“ Easter Theatre</a>" and in the last post. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-AE5XM3RY" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
