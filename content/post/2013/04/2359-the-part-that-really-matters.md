Photography is a matter of framing reality, right? But what's reality? From the solipsistic extreme of everything existing only in my mind (mind you, mine, not yours ðŸ™‚) to the idea of (one?) God's creation, pre-determined by his (her? their?) will(s), everything has been believed, and there it is how photography nicely meets philosophy, because all those philosophic views on the nature of reality are nothing but frames, drawn by our minds.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130402_152108_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130402_152108_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> This is what makes agreement so hard to achieve, but at the same time it is a never ending source of creativity. And strife ðŸ˜„

On the other side, knowing about how vague the very concept of reality is, makes it easy to let go of the idea of photography having to closely resemble reality - or anything at all. Although I guess we can agree on the way light is used in photography to create an image, if reality is fickle, it does not really matter how close to it we come.

 And once we are at that point, there is freedom ðŸ™‚
