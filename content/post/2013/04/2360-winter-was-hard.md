It's April, in less than a month the swimming season in Austria officially begins, yet Winter clings to us this year.

 The Image of the Day has been taken this morning. At the moment I am on the train to Carinthia, rolling though a winterly mountainscape. Only the fact that it is still day (sort of) betrays the time of year. In a few minutes, when I have finished this post, I shall lean back and read on in my journey through Jack Vance's "Lyonesse". If you've never read it but consider medieval fantasy an option for your entertainment, try it. You won't be disappointed. 

The Song of the Day is "Winter Was Hard" from the 1988 Kronos Quartet album of the same name. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_HHZ9byGMI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
