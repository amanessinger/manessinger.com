Thursday I was already in Carinthia, but let me still give you an image taken in Vienna. A scooter, taking a sun bath or, in German, Sonnenbad. And that's also the title of the image and of the Song of the Day. "Sonnenbad" is from the new album "Falsche Nasen" by the German band "<a href="http://www.waswennsregnet.de/" target="_blank">Was Wenns Regnet</a>" ("What If It Rains?").

It's interesting, I'm back to buying music. I didn't go so far yet as hearing it, but given some time, we may arrive there as well ðŸ™‚

The album is not available via Amazon.com (but of course at Amazon.de). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwcmrl4TyEU" target="_blank">YouTube has the video</a>.
