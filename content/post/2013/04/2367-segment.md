OK, one more for tonight ðŸ™‚

This is the image for Wednesday, actually taken Wednesday in Vienna. It's past midnight now, technically it's already Friday, although I prefer to pretend it is not.

 I hear music, hear old songs, buy some new, and the Song of the Day is from one of my latest acquisitions, Gabby Young &amp; Other Animals with the fabulous "Segment". Hear this woman sing on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d1N-4WuNfg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, you hardly will regret it.
