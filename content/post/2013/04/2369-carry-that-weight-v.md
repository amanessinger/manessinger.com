Yes, it's true, we've <a href="/2007/09/340-carry-that-weight.html" target="_blank">had</a> this song <a href="/2008/09/706-carry-that-weight-ii.html" target="_blank">four</a> <a href="/2011/10/1808-carry-that-weight-iii.html" target="_blank">times</a> <a href="/2011/10/1809-carry-that-weight-iv.html" target="_blank">already</a>, but always it was the Beatles original. Nothing wrong with that, but how about something completely different?

 There are many cover versions of Beatles songs, and some of the most remarkable are on an album that has not been available as digital downloads in a long time. Now it is, so let me present you a Concerto Grosso in the style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcangelo_Corelli" target="_blank">Arcangelo Corelli</a>, based on songs of The Beatles, arrangement by Peter Breiner, from the album "Beatles Go Baroque". "Carry That Weight" is the last piece of Concerto #4. Hear it from 9:00 in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXpeV21w6Bc" target="_blank">YouTube video</a>. But then, no, just hear it all from the beginning ðŸ™‚
