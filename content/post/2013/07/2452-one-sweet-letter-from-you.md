This is the field right over our fence. When I brought down the garbage, I recognized that the shadow of the electric post looked like a big letter "A".

 Hmm ... now when I think of it, who in his right mind would take a camera when bringing down the garbage? ðŸ˜„

Anyway. The Song of the Day is "One Sweet Letter From You" by Lionel Hampton and his Band. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XBOJ66HdtA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
