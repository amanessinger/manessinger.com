While we are discussing decay and nature re-claiming man-made constructions, here's some more of it.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130626_171202_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130626_171202_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Both images were taken on the railway platform in Vienna. I had just taken out the camera to make an image of the leaves growing up the noise protection wall, and when I went back to the spot where I knew the door of my preferred rail car would be, my eyes went down to the ground and saw a sign that seemingly had fallen from a mast.

 I have no idea what it means, some sort of signal I guess, but its diamond shape along with the star-shaped plant made me think of fallen stars.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/mina/stars_fell_on_alabama.html" target="_blank">Stars Fell On Alabama</a>", recorded ages ago by Italian superstar Mina. There may be better versions, but to its defense, I think this is rarely heard today ðŸ˜„
