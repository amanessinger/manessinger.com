This is the fence around a small square directly opposite our new office. The square was a local market that has been closed years before we moved there. Now, with more than thousand new people working and living in the neighborhood, I would expect the area to become a construction site pretty soon.

 I suppose a few restaurants there would be gold mines and a safe investment, but so far only posters have been attached to the fence. The area has been sold to a private development company, and they seem to wait for some unusual opportunity to maximize their profits. Understandable and unfortunate, but we will see ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "Meet Me Around The Corner" by Big Joe Williams. Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYaBeeAaipE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
