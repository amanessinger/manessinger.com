I've already used this title almost 2000 days ago in "<a href="/2008/03/524-for-you-blue.html" target="_blank">524 â€“ For You Blue</a>", and some of those images were actually similar to today's Image of the Day.

Flowers on summer meadows are almost always more impressive in your memories than later on photographs. This is due to the way our brains work, and one way to overcome it, is to pop up saturation.

 Here I've tried a different approach, using the sensational Olympus 75/1.8 lens. I don't use it all the time, but when I do, I like it very much ðŸ™‚

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/b/beatles/for_you_blue.html" target="_blank">For You Blue</a>" from the Beatles album "Let It Be". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_UvXbKyPnk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
