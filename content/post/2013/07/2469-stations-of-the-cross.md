The Green Cross is an organization similar to the Red Cross, only that it's not red but ... green? Not only that there is a Green Cross as distinguised from the Red Cross in Austria, no there is more than one of them, different organizations that make a point of not being connected with each other. At least this is mentioned like an important fact on their <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96sterreichisches_Gr%C3%BCnes_Kreuz" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page. I guess I'm not supposed to understand it. Must have something to do with politics ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/e/elvis_costello/stations_of_the_cross_lyrics.html" target="_blank">Stations Of The Cross</a>" from Elvis Costello's 2010 album "National Ransom". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wVsCrZPd3U" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
