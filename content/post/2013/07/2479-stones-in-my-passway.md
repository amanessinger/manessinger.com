Take any Robert Johnson song and you'll find countless interpreters. Interestingly enough I have only one version of <a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/r/robert_johnson/stones_in_my_passway.html" target="_blank">this song</a> and that's Peter Green's on his "Robert Johnson Songbook" from 2005, but that's exactly what I can't find online.  

 What I do find is Eric Clapton though. Well, another Englishman, I guess he'll do for demonstration purposes ðŸ˜„
