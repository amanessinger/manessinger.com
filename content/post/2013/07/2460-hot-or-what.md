Given how much I've waited for this summer, it marches along at a frightening pace. The hottest days were short and are already over, but there's still no reason to complain ðŸ™‚

 I don't know exactly what made me stop in the heat of the afternoon, on my way to the train, made me crouch on the sidewalk and take an image of a box and a few lines. I just did it, because it felt like the right thing to do. And it was. You don't need to like this image, but I do ðŸ˜„

The Song of the Day is "Hot Or What" from Mark Knopfler's 2013 album "Privateering". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0L6SHx7TIQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
