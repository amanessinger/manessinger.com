Sounds like a resolution, huh? Not really though ðŸ˜„

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2013/20130713_205618_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2013/20130713_205618_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Recently I poured myself a glass of rum and when I put it on the kitchen counter, the lights cast very peculiar reflexes. Obviously I had to take an image.

 The Song of the Day, "Drink No More", is from the 1990 Jay Leonhart album "Salamander Pie". At that time it was the reference album of a German hifi magazine, and that's how I learned about it. Well, it still sounds terrific, and even more important, it's very, very good music. Hear for yourself on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRlKFNNhcYk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
