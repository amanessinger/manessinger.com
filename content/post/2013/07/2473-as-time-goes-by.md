This is a wall outside of a place where I have lived for a long time. Paint peeling, the wrong type of paint, once clumsily applied, with the application of two layers having watched by me. As time goes by.

 The Song of the Day is a version of this song recorded for Natalie Cole's 1993 album "Take A Look". Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Zi1I4GfOk" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
