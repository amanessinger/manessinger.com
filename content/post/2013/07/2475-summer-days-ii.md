This is the next one in this mini series of wallpapers. Same pond, same flowers, only this time it's my currently widest lens, the Olympus 12/2.0. Again you find the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/9352757197/sizes/o/" target="_blank">full size on Flickr</a>.

In case you wonder, no, I didn't use a polarizer. Not because I generally dislike them, rather just because I currently don't own any that fit on my tiny lenses. I've done some things in Lightroom though. Mostly it's pulling the highlights back to -100, pushing them back up selectively where I feel it's needed (for instance the white flowers), de-saturating the blues, shifting them slightly towards magenta, increasing vibrance, using a radial filter, and in general trying to create a pleasing tonal distribution along with vibrant but still believable colors. Hmm ... maybe a polarizer would have been easier ðŸ˜„

 The Song of the Day is still "Summer Days" from the 2013 Camper Van Beethoven album "La Costa Perdida". Hear it live on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLOOMm_gNgg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
