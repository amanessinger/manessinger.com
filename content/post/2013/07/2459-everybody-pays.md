America is at war with the world and its citizens. Not with everybody, but with most of them, even most of its own. America spies on everyone and trusts nobody. Everybody could be a terrorist, everybody could copy their so-called "intellectual property". Poor America ðŸ™‚

Dissent on economic systems makes them send out their agents and their drones, revelation of their betrayal of their own people's rights and freedom makes them antagonize all of what they like to treat as their colonial backyard. Poor America ðŸ™‚

But worst of all, the deadliest of dangers, encryption and freedom of speech for everyone, makes them mobilize their most feared weapons of mass destruction, the rating agencies and the credit card companies.

Well, you can, but you can't pay for it with US-controlled plastic money.

You can pay for porn and you can pay for your own automatic guns, interestingly enough, at this time you can even donate to the defense of Bradley Manning, but giving people access to comfortable encryption and self-controlled privacy, that's obviously too much.

 If you ask them, then it's always the same story. Terrorists and child pornographers eat your children and your puppies, but as always and ever, it's a lie, just a shameless lie, trumpeted into the world over and over and over again. 

In reality it's all about the money, it's all about being in control, it's all about being able to perpetuate the status quo. America does not produce anything any more (well, almost), but it wants to own everything, your genes, your thoughts, your memories and your ideas, and most of all it wants to own and control all the channels of communication that you use. It wants to own you. For the best, but not for the best of you.
