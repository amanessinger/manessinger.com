The Olympus 45/1.8, an equivalent to 90&nbsp;mm in "full frame" terms, when used on the OM-D and viewed through the electronic viewfinder, roughly shows me the camera image at the same size as reality around me. When I look through the EVF with one eye and when I don't close the other eye, it's almost as if I would use no camera at all. Roughly the same size on both eyes, an easy task for the brain. 

The 45/1.8 also gives me the field of view that I have when I'm concentrated. The 45/1.8 is my car lens. It's the lens that I turn to when something catches my attention while I drive. Well, not that I take images while driving (at least not regularly), but when I come back to the spot later or because I stopped immediately, the 45 frames exactly what has attracted me in the first place.

 Things can turn out differently of course, something that I later see may end up as the final image, often taken with a shorter or a longer lens, but if I stick to the original subject, I very likely stick to the 45 as well.

The Image of the Day was taken while I waited for a semaphore to turn green.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/k/kate_bush/somewhere_in_between.html" target="_blank">Somewhere In Between</a>" from Kate Bush’s 2005 album “Aerial”. I've used it for the first time in "<a href="/2012/09/2171-somewhere-in-between.html" target="_blank">2171 – Somewhere In Between</a>" .Hear it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-HiDZ1MqWo" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
