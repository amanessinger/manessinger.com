Back to my bad habits? Hopefully not, but yes, yesterday I had used up all my scheduled posts and failed to write a few more. On the plus side, it gave me the opportunity to immediately <a href="/2013/07/2461-no-connection.html" target="_blank">react to Ted's comments</a>.

 Let's keep this short, and while I'm on the train to Vienna, I'll try to get a few more posts into the pipeline.

The Song of the Day is "<a href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/m/mark_knopfler/boom_like_that.html" target="_blank">Boom, Like That</a>" from Mark Knopfler's 2004 album "Shangri-La". We had the album a few days ago, hear this song as well on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvj4svKcjl0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
