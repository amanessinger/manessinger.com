This is the exclusive part. We've been on the tower, at
night, looking down at Rathausplatz in Christmas decoration.
We've also been in the attic, but although that was
fascinating, it hardly comes across in images.

What you see in the middle ground is Ringstra√üe with
Burgtheater. That's what Viennese boast of as _The Best
Theatre in German Language_. It might well be true :smile:

Far in the background, you see the cupola of Paulskirche and
the characteristic gothic spire of Saint Stephen's.

Originally, I had not considered the image for the blog.
I've processed it just now, and given this is ISO 3200 on
Micro Four Thirds, using a tiny wide-angle prime wide open
at f2.0, the quality is astounding. Sharpness, tiniest
details, no visible noise, and that although I've raised the
shadows in the background considerably: this is what you get
from DxO Pure RAW 3's Deep PRIME XD noise reduction.
