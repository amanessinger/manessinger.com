I work for Vienna's Administration. For a long time, we had
a building near City Hall, twelve years ago be were
transferred to a new office complex far from the center.

In all this time, I never visited City Hall. One evening in
December 2019, our team did, and we got a pretty exclusive
tour. 

This is not exclusive, this is what every tour sees, it's
the giant Chandelier in the big hall where the city's
parliament meets.
