Hey, we've made it! This is the first picture of 2020 :grin:

In Vienna, we live in a district that was relatively rural
for a long time. There were huge areas growing vegetables,
much of that in glasshouses. Many of them are neglected now,
the owners seemingly only waiting for buyers, as new
developments eat their way into the agricultural areas.
