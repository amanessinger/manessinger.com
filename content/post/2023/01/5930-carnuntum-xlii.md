Restoration of archaeological sites is always problematic.
On the other hand, archeology is expensive, and if not even
partial restoration is attempted, there might be little
incentive for financing it. The golden way is somewhere in
the middle. We saw it with the main street. They could have
rebuilt the other side of the street as welll, and thereby
created a theme park.

Here, they just removed the earth from the walls, making the
foundations visible.
