It's not been the Colosseum, but well, Carnuntum had an
amphitheater. In fact, it had not one but two of them. One
was in the civil city, the other in the military camp. This
is the civil one. It had room for around 13.000 spectators.
The military arena took 8.000 - which together is quite a
lot :grin:
