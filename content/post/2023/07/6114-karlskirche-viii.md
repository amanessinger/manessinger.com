The metal tower in the church contained an elevator, leading
to a platform inside the cupola. Once there, this is what we
saw.

Or, actually not. You can imagine the extreme difference in
light color and intensity between the lantern of the cupola
and the cupola's interior wall, lit by artificial light.
What I did here, was to mask the oval of the lantern, and
radically brighten up everything else, with a strong tint
towards green and an even greater shift towards blue. Of
course, I have used DxO Deep PRIME XD before. 

Even after this forceful treatment, the result is remarkably
free of noise. It does not look as it was, but it looks
certainly like a model lit by daylight from below :grin:
