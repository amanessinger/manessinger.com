Karlsplatz, here seen from top of the church, has always
been a problematic spot. It was never pretty. Today it is
mostly covered by Ressel-Park, the park in front of the old
Building of Vienna's Technical University. The rest is the
crossing of a few big streets, and of course (what you don't
see) the crossing of three Underground lines. It's the major
Underground hub in Vienna.

In recent years, excessive policing has kept drug dealers
and consumers off Karlsplatz, but of course the problem was
only pushed to other, less prominent place.
