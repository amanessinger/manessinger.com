First we went south-east, then west, and now we are in
Paulanerkirche, a church in Wiedner Hauptstra√üe. I had never
been inside, it was open, naturally I took some images. I
did it with a new camera, the Olympus OM-D E-M1 MkIII.
Actually those "After the Snow" images a few days ago were
already taken with it.
