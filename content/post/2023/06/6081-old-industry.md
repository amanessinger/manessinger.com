Forget about today's delivery "services". There was a time,
not long away, when you knew your postman by name, as he
knew you. If he didn't encounter you at home, he knew your
trusted neighbors. You never had a problem getting your
parcels.

Today, some "services" don't even ring your bell. They just
leave a message that your parcel is somewhere at a shop a
few kilometers from you, in an old, industrial area only
reachable by car.

You can complain, like I do, but you have no rights. The
"service" is not contractually bound to you. You are not
their customer, you are just a delivery address. They are
cheap for vendors though.
