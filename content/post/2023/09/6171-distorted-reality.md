The NYT had an interesting opinion piece by Paul Krugman
recently: [‘I’m OK, but Things Are
Terrible’](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/07/opinion/economy-inflation-negativity.html?searchResultPosition=12).
It's a good read, unless you don't read Krugman on
principle. But even then :grin:

He makes the point that, according to all indicators, the US
economy is doing extraordinarily well. World-class, given
recent history and how everyone else does. At the same time,
people, and not only Republicans, claim that the economy is
terrible. How is that?

He explains that most people, asked about themselves, say
they're OK, but they are convinced everyone else is
suffering. And that's how the lie, fuelled by "conservative"
media works: Even if you don't suffer, other people do.
Don't believe your experience, believe us.

I've put "conservative" in quotes, because everywhere
outside the US, the NTY is seen as pretty right wing
