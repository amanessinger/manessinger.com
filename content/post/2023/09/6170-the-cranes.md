This is seen from the end of the street where, on the far
side left, not visible here, my small apartment in Vienna
is. When I got there in 2013, the right side was empty.
Former industrial area, everything razed, used as parking
lots. This image is from 2020, and of course a year later,
everything under construction here had been finished.
