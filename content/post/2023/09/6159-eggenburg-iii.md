Advanced General AI would know, that we want to remove the
cars, and it would know how to automatically fill the gaps
with convincing backgrounds, with correct perspective,
perfectly lit, perfectly sized in respect to surrounding
image areas, with perfectly blending textures. Luckily we
are far from that, at least for the next few years :grin:

But really, if you think about it, these are real hard
problems, and not only computationally. Currently, we train
generative AIs with images. That way they "learn" features
of real images. Given enough training images, you can find
similarities between the surroundings of the gaps you want
to fill, with content of similar images. For various
criteria of similarity.

Overly simplified, one could say that Photoshop's
"Content-aware Fill" draws from areas of your own image,
while a generative AI would draw from the trillions of
"learned" images.

Still, that's not enough to make judgements about what a
user will want to remove. You'd need a prompt like "remove
all cars" for that.

An always-online AI could, of course, collect the prompts of
its users, and thereby "learn", that users tend to remove
cars from scenic images. Sounds like an orwellian nightmare?
Yes, but that's what is actually done. What did you expect?
