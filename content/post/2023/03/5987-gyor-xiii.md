Walls were normal in European cities. Then, during the
Napoleonic wars, the French swept victoriously across
Europe. In that phase, before their ultimate defeat, many of
the fortresses of old were dismantled. It happened in my
hometown Klagenfurt, it happened in Vienna and in so many
more cities. The space was used for circular boulevards like
Vienna's Ringstraße.

Here in Győr, a part of the wall has survived.
