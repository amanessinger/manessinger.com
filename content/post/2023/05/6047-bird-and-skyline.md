The Sigma 56/1.4 is a pretty unusual landscape lens. On
Micro Four Thirds, it is a moderate telephoto lens. I rarely
use it, and when I do, I mostly use it for unusual purposes
:grin:

It is not as versatile as the 45/1.8 and twice as heavy. It
is faster than the Olympus 60/2.8, but of course it's
heavier and no macro lens. Right above it sits the Olympus
75/1.8, equally heavy but much more beautiful. I guess, it's
easy to understand why the Sigma is under-utilized :grin:
