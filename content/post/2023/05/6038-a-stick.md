Just a stick, nothing more. Seen through a 25/0.95 lens. I
suppose this is not wide open, because I would likely have
needed an ND filter and I've stopped carrying filters a long
time ago.

I rarely use those lenses (I have a 17 and a 42.5 as well),
but sometimes manual focusing is satisfying. I do it for a
week or two, and then I stop for a year :smile:
