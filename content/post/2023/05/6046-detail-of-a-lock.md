In the 1970s, river Danube was regulated, a long stretched
island was built, the river basically split. The
conservative opposition was strictly against it, especially
against the island. It would become a wasteland, ripe with
crime, or whatever.

Suffice to say, it turned into one of the biggest triumphs
of the Social Democratic government. The island is one of
Vienna's most-frequented parks, less a tourist attraction
than a part of everyday life for young and old.
