This bridge,
[Reichsbrücke](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsbr%C3%BCcke),
has an interesting history. It was first built in 1876,
replaced due to structural damages in 1937, and in 1976, a
hundred years after the first one, the second collapsed. It
happend at 4:53 in the morning. Only three cars and a bus
were on the bridge, one driver died.

We seriously hope the third bridge will keep standing this time.
