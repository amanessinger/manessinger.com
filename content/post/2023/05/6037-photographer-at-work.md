First of May. Labour Day. Not a tradition for me, although
you could call me a socialist. Well, commie for you
Americans :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

At the moment, the "left" in Austria is fractured and
powerless, like everywhere. We know, we'd need a big,
communal effort, a thing that's socialism's fort√©, in order
to save this dying planet. National efforts won't work. We
need coordination on global scale. World order, but
peaceful. 

No wonder that the other side thrives. It's so much easier
to kindle hate and distrust, to lie about what we all know,
to pretend that the problems don't exist, to deny any action
at all. Voters like it too. They love hearing that
everything's ok, everything has been like this all the time,
and slow change and weak memory are a deadly combination.

Our Social Democratic Party is currently paralyzed in its
in-fight between the current female leader who can't lead, a
slightly nationalist policeman who desperately wants to
lead, and the mayor of a small town who threw his hat into
the ring, because he could. The party mostly stands behind
the current leader. 

The policeman and party head and governor of our smallest
and poorest federal country has wide appeal, but probably
with the wrong people. He definitely wants to tackle
immigration, but given that this would require a European
effort, I fear it is just cheap populism. 

If there's one thing Austria does not need at all, then it
is a shift to  the right. Much to the contrary, and people
recognize this. In two communal elections in Graz and
Salzburg, the Communist Party, the most unlikely of all, the
party always shunned in Austria since the Russian occupiers
left in the fifties, was a big winner. In Graz, they even
won the mayor.

Andreas Babler, the mayor of Baden bei Wien, is also
successful, within the Social Democrats, but on their left
wind. People recognize him as leftist, and so far, it didn't
hurt him. Well, he may even be more left than Eisenhower,
which is pretty left in today's terms :smile:

I'm not a member of the party. I have no idea if I could
enter and vote, but it's likely too late. In any case, I'd
go for the Babler.
