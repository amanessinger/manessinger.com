This is DC Tower 1. Originally DC Tower 2 should stand
opposite, slightly smaller, but showing the same design and
color. The two irregular faces should have been looking like
a big monolith, broken in two.

Won't happen. DC Tower 2 will be different. We are not
French, this is not Paris. We like to start grand things,
but we are bad at finishing them. Even our Emperor's Palace
was never finished :smile:
