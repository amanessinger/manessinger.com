And for a while that was it for the Mitakon 25/0.95. It's
not a travel lens. It's not a street shooter's lens. It's a
cheap substitute for the Olympus 25/1.2 PRO lens. It's not
even that light. It's lighter than the Olympus 1.2 line, but
it is much heavier than the Olympus 1.8 line.

You get all three lenses for what you pay for one of the
PROs.
