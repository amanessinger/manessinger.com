At the end of January 2020, we spent some days in
Loipersdorf, Styria, one of the premium spas in Austria. At
a highway service area we took breakfast, when a chinese
tourist group entered the restaurant. At that time, news of
Covid in China were already spreading. I can remember a
certain queasy feeling, that I immediately fought. A billion
chinese, a few hundred affected, what are the chances?

The image was taken in our hotel.
