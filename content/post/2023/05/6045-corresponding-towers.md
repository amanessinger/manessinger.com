Vienna changes. Interestingly enough, the tower to the left
keeps being solitary. Vienna grows high along the central
north axis, but only on the other side river Danube.

Other areas sprouting towers are in the south, along the
south-east tangent highway, mostly outside, but some inside,
and in an area north of Prater, Vienna's biggest park.

Vienna's towers begin to surround the historic city. Most
are office towers, but increasingly we see expensive
residential buildings.

For reasons of geographic distribution, we don't see the
typically dense inner-city street life, that we associate
with higher concentrations of skyscrapers. No new city
centers have been created.
