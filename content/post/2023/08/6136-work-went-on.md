Throughout the pandemic. Feeling isolated was a problem of
the privileged. You can't build a house "from home". Those
who had to go out to work had other problems though. They
were demonstrated, that they had to work, even under greater
risk, and with no more, mostly much less compensation than
the sheltered.

The pandemic increased the class divide, but in a totally
non-marxist sense. It drove workers to the right, from where
rich, well-sheltered demagogues expressed their solidarity.

Our political systems still suffer from the resulting
anti-democratic shift.
