Susi and I will retire in six and seven years. We could keep
on renting here in Vienna, but one enticing option is, to go
to Klagenfurt and live in the house my father built. 160 sqm
(plus about 60 in the basement), a garage, all on a parcel
of 1100 sqm. Equal shares belong to my sister and me, but my
sister wants to stay in Vienna for sure. Since my father's
death the house has been rented. Don't know for sure yet,
but it's an option.

Anyway. I love trees and I would immediately buy one or two
trees, likely expensive ones, because at my age, in order to
sit below them, I'd have to buy them big. No time to waste.

The linden tree is a typical tree here in Vienna, and it's
wide-spread in Carinthia as well. No chance, they grow too
slow, but actually I have no idea what trees I would buy. We
have climate change. I would hate to invest in trees, only
to see them die.
