View to the south. The mountain chain is called _Karawanken_,
and according to the Carinthian hymn, it's where _blood drew
the border_. Slovenia is on the other side, and the myth of
1920's victory in the _Carinthian Defense War_ is kept alive
by nationalist populists. Keep the hate alive. That's all
they can do.
