In 129 days from now, I will run out of processed images.
We'll still be in 2020. It's not disturbing, but I'll have
to process images more often :grin:

I won't run out of images anytime. It might happen tough,
that some of them will never get processed at all. On the
bright side: then I will have stopped caring.
