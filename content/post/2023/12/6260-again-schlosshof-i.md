In 2016, [3539 - The Day After: A Few Thoughts on
Brexit](/2016/06/3539-the-day-after-a-few-thoughts-on-brexit)
was the first post in a series with pictures made at
Schlosshof, one of Prince Eugene's castles.

It was mostly an analysis of the impact of Brexit. I just
re-read it, and I think it stands the test of time. Brexit
was so stupid and so ridiculous, that no other outcome was
possible. Labour didn't win yet, but they didn't have an
opportunity yet either. On the other side, Keir Starmer
currently acts like a Tory at the moment, so they may even
botch it, and if not, it may not make a difference.

Anyway, what I got completely wrong in an answer to a
comment below that post, was my assumption, that the US
would never vote for a Trump presidency
