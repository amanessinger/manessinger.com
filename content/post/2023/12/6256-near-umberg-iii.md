I like what I've done here. It even looks quite good,
compared to a "real" HDR as seen on an HDR monitor. In HDR,
the brightness of the sky dominates the image, turns the
focus completely away from what I wanted to show.

You see, now that Lightroom partially supports HDR (even if
the Internet doesn't), I try how past images would look, if
only I could use it.

The gist is: you can make every image look more "real", but
at the same time, especially if color detail in the
highlights has not entirely been preserved, you enter a
similar "[uncanny
valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)" as we
know it from computer games and human-like robots. The more
real an image gets, the more disturbing even the finest
differences get.
