I've just spent a few hours experimenting with real HDR, the
one that needs HDR devices for output. As already said, it's
useless right now. It's also unintuitive. Things not always
look better from the start, but from just a RAW file, you
can make everything look glorious.

It will take a whole new set of intuitions though. There are
so many more options you have, and there is nothing
obviously correct. We'll have to learn everything again. I
wonder how long it will take.
