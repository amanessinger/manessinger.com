I have no idea, why I took this image at f8, ISO 200, 1.3s.
With the OMD's image stabilization, I should have easily got
perfect sharpness, but I remember heavily shaking from the
awkward position I had to be in, in order to get the
composition.

That's the reason why I have switched to Auto-ISO with 1/10s
lower limit on speed and ISO 3200 upper limit on ISO. No
worry, DxO will fix any noise. I've done that in Rome last
spring. I still was a little worried, but the results were
perfect. At the current speed of this blog, we'll get there
in a few years :grin:
