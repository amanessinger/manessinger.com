Well, this is an interesting picture. Sometime early last
spring I've spent a lot of time trying to process it. I
ended up with a bland version, where the outside was well in
gamut and range. This was due to the incredible difference
in light levels outside, and the small amount of light
inside. It's a north-facing window, after all.

Today, when writing this post, I wondered if I could do
better.

The first thing was, to activate [HDR editing in
Lightroom](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/hdr-output.html).
I'm editing on a 2021 Macbook Pro, and on its native
display, it supports HDR.

Wow!

Absolutely crazy! The image looked gorgeous immediately, and
with a little fiddling, I managed to let it even look
better. I wish I could show you the result, but of course I
can't.

I can export it in HDR in either JPEG XL or in AVIS formats.
Adobe currently recommends AVIS, but they don't really go
into details about their three colorspace options _HDR sRGB
(Rec. 709)_, _HDR P3_, _HDR Rec. 2020_. I have tried looking
at AVIS exports with sRGB and with P3 in the only currently
available viewer, in Google Chrome. Both look fine, both
look a little different from what I see in Lightroom's edit
mode, and that's on the same display.

Yes, the only widely available viewer for these picture
formats is a browser. It's the market leader, but not
everybody has it. Not even Lightroom can display the formats
outside its editor. In Lightroom's gallery or in its
full-screen mode, it looks even blander than my initial
rendition.

And even if everybody used Google Chrome as browser for
surfing the web and especially my blog, even then I could
not use it. Most people don't have displays capable of
rendering HDR. I suppose as long as you use a modern,
expensive TV set attached to your computer, it would even
work. For most kinds of computer monitors, even for many
expensive ones, it doesn't.

HDR exports become common in the video space, but for
web-distributed pictures, the technology is still very
experimental. If you have a recent Mac (as many
photographers do), I suggest you try it yourself with one of
your HDR pictures. You'll love it, but probably you'll hate
me for the tip, once you despair trying to export it to
anything your viewers could possibly see on their devices
:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Finally, I ended up creating complicated masks, with different 
tone mappings for the landscape behind the window, the sky,
and the interior separately.

The detour into HDR edit mode was at least very instructive.
It told me, what the image is supposed to look. It made
painfully clear, how inappropriate the original version was.
What you see now is not real HDR, it does not look as good
as real HDR would, but has the same character, in induces
the same feeling.
