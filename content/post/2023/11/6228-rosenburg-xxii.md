Nice bookcases. Is this how the room originally looked? Very
unlikely, but then, who cares and who would know. Normally
they take what remaining furniture there is, after all those
centuries, and spread it in a way that hides the dearth. I
would expect paintings, tapestries and oriental carpets. On
the other hand, you wouldn't want to let legions of visitors
to wear down your expensive carpets, would you?
