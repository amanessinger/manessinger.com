These images were taken with a relatively cheap, manual focus Walimex lens - or Samyang or Rokinion, depending on where you buy it.

I bought it when it was available for 30% off on Amazon. Normally I would probably have bought the expensive and super-stellar Olympus 8/1.8 for between two and three times the price. Would it have been worth it? Probably not. This lens has plenty of sharpness, and most of the time focusing is not necessary at all. The Olympus would have given me some extra greatness, bought with extra size and extra weight.

I don't have to remember packing it, it's just available when I need it and that's surprisingly quite often. Had I bought the Olympus, I would have been forced to buy a bigger bag (NO WAY!!!) or alternatively I would have been forced to choose between the 7-14 and the fish. You see, better sometimes can be much worse ðŸ™‚
