Again, for an unexpected church, this is amazing. Loreta alone would have been be worth the trip from Vienna.

By the way, having just read the German version of the Wikipedia page that I'v linked to in yesterday's post, I can now say that the Italian church was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreto,_Marche" target="_blank">Loreto</a> in the province of Ancona.
