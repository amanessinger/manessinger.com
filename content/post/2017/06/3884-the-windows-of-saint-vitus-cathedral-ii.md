In many cities in central Europe, glass windows have not survived World War II. This is especially true for most of Germany and Austria, but it's also true for much of the occupied territories. It may also be true for parts of southern England. Aerial bombardments and glass windows make for a bad match.

Prague has been occupied, but it was largely spared the bombings that devastated so many of our old cities.

You see it. Prague looks older than, for instance, Vienna, and it has a density of sights that is far greater. Yes, from communist times you have a lot of unpleasant architecture at the outskirts, but at the center it is extremely beautiful. By contrast, in Vienna you have regions at the center that had been hastily rebuilt after the war, and the architecture used was cheap as well. But that's how it is and that's why we have to be thankful for being able to live in peace. I'm quite sure the people in Aleppo would have loved it as well.
