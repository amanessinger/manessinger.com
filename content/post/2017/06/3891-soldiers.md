Soldiers in a church? Certainly! This church was built after the victory of the emperor's troops in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_White_Mountain" target="_blank">Battle of White Mountain</a>, one of the most important battles in the Thirty Years' War. Around 5000 soldiers died in that battle, and the outcome meant that the Emperor could reclaim Prague.
