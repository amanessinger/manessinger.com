This is one of two last churches that I visited on my way out of Prague. The fisheye effect is not immediately visible because I took the image straight up into the center of the ceiling. I couldn't exactly remember the church, but using Google Maps and Wikipedia, I found out it was the <a href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostel_svat%C3%A9ho_Jilj%C3%AD_(Praha)" target="_blank">Church of Saint Giles</a>.
