So you've made it through the queue, huh? And now? What have you expected? A cathedral all for yourself? With all the other people patiently waiting outside, until you've managed to take your pictures?

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20161025_095141-Edit_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20161025_095141-Edit_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Forget about it. Well, actually it reminded me more than a little of the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel in Rome. Hmm, last time I was there, it was before my photographer days. I have no idea if you can even take photos there.

Anyway. Parts of the cathedral are off limits. You can go there, and although it is as if you were in a much smaller church, you can have that part all for yourself - for a few seconds, until the next photographer in line asks for his share ðŸ™‚
