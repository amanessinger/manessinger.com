If so, it's certainly not one of his most prominent works.

I could have documented them by taking images of the labels, but that would have taken me out of "Seeing Mode". I don't do that any more. I also used to buy museum catalogs. The problem is, that they are heavy and I don't want to haul them around. As always, the solution would be an ebook. Hmm ... actually I didn't even ask. Maybe I should have? How else would they know there is demand?
