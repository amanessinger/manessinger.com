The National Gallery in Prague is spread over a a few buildings, one or two down in the center, the rest up in front of the castle.

I've just taken a few pictures of sculptures and paintings that I found impressive or appealing for any reason.

One of today's images is of course a Rembrand, the other - I don't know. I like it though. It's a beautiful rural scene with an abundance of details.
