Oh this image! It took me at least 10 attempts to get a decently sharp image, but then, I have the best stabiliztion in the world, right? I can do 0.3s in no light at ISO 200 and an equivalent focal length of 80 mm, right?

Well, no ðŸ™‚ It would have been much better to let the camera go to ISO 1600 and get away with one quick shot. After all, there's not a world of dynamic range in this images.
