I felt I needed to mention the lens used in yesterday's post. This certainly wouldn't have been necessary today.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20161025_133103_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20161025_133103_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Years ago, in "Photoshop times", I had a plugin called "FisheyeHemi". It did some magic to partially remove the distortion along one axis, while at the same time maintaining most of the lens' extended angle of view. 

DxO can do something similar. I've just tried to play around a little with "Volume Deformation" in the variant of "Horizontal +200" and "Vertical +200". Add a little keystone correction and the result is, that the verticals in the center are almost straight, while those at the sides are still bent as hell. It's a nice effect. Maybe I'll experiment a little bit more with it tomorrow.
