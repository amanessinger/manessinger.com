Is this Saint Vitus? I have no idea. He is certainly not Wenceslaus or Adalbert, the other two saints that this cathedral is dedicated to, but the attributes don't fit to Vitus either.

On the other hand, this is the most impressive of saints in the ambulatory, the outer walk around the main altar, where everybody is lead through. Of course I could have listened to the countless guides, but I was busy photographing ðŸ™‚
