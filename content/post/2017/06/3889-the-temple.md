I had no idea that this church even exists. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreta" target="_blank">Loreta</a>. That's a kind of church dedicated to the house of the Virgin Mary. 

Well, what I've called a "temple" here, symbolizes the "Santa Casa", in German often called the "Holy Hut". Certainly kind of a nice hut, I'm sure you agree ðŸ™‚ 

Here in Prague it is in the center of a cloister. I don't know if it's always in a monastery, but I suppose it is. I've only seen one such church before, in a small city in Italy. It may have been in Perugia, and if not, it was at least not far from there.
