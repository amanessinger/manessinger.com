<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20161025_172310_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20161025_172310_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> I like to take photographs of paintings. Surprisingly it's possible in quite a few of the big museums.

Instead I try to correct the images, much like I do with my own photographs.

Over the centuries the varnish of paintings tends to get yellow, even brownish. The effect is very similar to a color temperature that's set too high. It turns out that you can very effectively remove the color cast of paintings in Lightroom. Of course I can't be sure that this is how the paintings were originally intended, but normally the results look extremely balanced.
