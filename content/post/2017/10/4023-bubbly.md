After I had bought the OM-D E-M1 Mk II, I did what I always do when I have a new toy: I used it almost exclusively for quite some time. It took not very long though, and I began to miss the light weight and the small size of my PEN-F and the tiny primes. 

Well, the 75/1.8 is maybe not that tiny and light, but for an equivalent focal length of 150&nbsp;mm it is small and light enough. Now it's October, and in the meantime I have arrived at a simple system. In general I use the PEN-F in Vienna, and in Carinthia and for major vacations I use the OM-D. Except for the exceptions, of course ðŸ™‚
