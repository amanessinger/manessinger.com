Did I ever say I love the bokeh of this 75/1.8? Well, I guess I did a few times ðŸ˜„

In the meantime a lot of things have happened. One thing is, that we had general elections. Didn't turn out well. I may write a few words about it in another post.

The other thing is, that I had found the performance of my Google Nexus 9 tablet lacking, and so much so, that I had searched for a replacement for months.

It's not so easy. Basically I want a vanilla or near-vanilla Android on a new tablet. This eliminates the Samsung S3, the seemingly best Android tablet in the market. Samsung loves to bundle lots of software that I don't want or need, and they are bad at keeping their devices up to date. Additionally the S3 is a year old. I think it got Android 7 via an update, but if it'll ever get Android 8, who knows.

There's a relatively cheap Lenovo Tab4 10 Plus with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 (same as in my phone), 4 GB of memory and 64 GB of storage (same as my phone), but only 1920x1200 (hardly more than my phone). Performance-wise I'd have been happy with it and it will very likely get the update, but I really, really wanted something with higher pixel density.

It's not a matter of price. I would have bought everything. It's only that nobody cares to offer high-end Android tablets. Actually I would even buy a Microsoft Surface, were it not for the weight. When traveling, I always have my Macbook Pro with me. That's what I use when I need a keyboard and a mouse. No tablet comes close and I don't need a tablet as notebook replacement. I need it for reading in bed.

Last Saturday I snapped. I've got an iPad Pro 10.5 now, 256 GB of memory, tons of performance, the whole German Wikipedia (pictures included) on my tablet, along with all the 7122 images that I've processed during the last 11 years. And then I've got peace of mind ðŸ˜„
