4000 blog posts, at least one per day, almost eleven years. So, why is this painful?

The image was taken at the hospital on February 20 this year. I was there with my parents to hear the results of my father's chemotherapy. Basically the cancer in his liver had not receded and instead grown. Further chemotherapy was offered tentatively, but it was clear that he would die some time this year. It was just a matter of how long his liver could carry on working.

It's a sad image.
