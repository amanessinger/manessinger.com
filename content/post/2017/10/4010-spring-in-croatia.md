Vienna is normally two weeks ahead of Carinthia, vegetation-wise. Although Carinthia is slightly south of Vienna, 250 meters of altitude make a difference. Here we are in Croatia, further south and on sea level as well. 

It's always a joy driving down to the sea in early spring and seeing flowers aplenty.
