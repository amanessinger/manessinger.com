In early March I've been in Munich's Olympiapark to see a concert. This was 45 years after the 1972 Olympic Summer Games and 45 years after that futuristic glass tent was built.

There is a certain patina of age on the buildings, which is in a stark and interesting contrast with the radically modern architecture.
