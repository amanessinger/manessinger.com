This is a cheap apartment building with a nice facade, especially in this late light. I've seen some apartment floor plans, and they are all the same and among the worst. 

Basically you have a small balcony that is the width of the whole apartment. The balcony is on the short side of a long, narrow room with no other windows. Then, in the middle of the apartment there is a bathroom without windows at all, followed by another long room with its only windows on the far side. Basically the apartments are a series of stacked tubes. It does not help either, that the balconies face a loud and busy street. Horrible.
