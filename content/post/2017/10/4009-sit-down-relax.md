Do you remember images that you've taken? Normally I do, especially those that I've decided to post-process. Of course I remember this image as well. I remember the place, the time of day, everything, but it feels like it had been ages ago.

Munich is some time ago, but it definitely feels like "this year". Even the ice images from January feel closer than this one. Why? I have no idea.
