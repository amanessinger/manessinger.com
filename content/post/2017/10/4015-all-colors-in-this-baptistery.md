When we arrived at the church, it was actually closed. By chance a nun cleaning in the interior saw us, opened the door, invited us in, gave us lots of background information and finally showed us the baptistery, a room normally closed even at opening times. That's where I made this image. It's not only a lucky one, it's also one I'm proud of ðŸ™‚
