Across the street from our office there once was a market square with lots of small booths. I never saw it, because when we got there four and a half years ago (not longer, really?), the market was abolished, the booths torn down and the square fenced in. 

People in the neighborhood had fought for their market, but to no avail. An office building was planned in that place. Or a hotel. I'm not sure. Still the square is empty and fenced in.

In the beginning the wooden fences were densely covered in adertising posters, but the furious people kept tearing them down. A few times I have taken images of the fence and the remains of the ads. Today almost all traces of ads are gone. At least it's more honest.
