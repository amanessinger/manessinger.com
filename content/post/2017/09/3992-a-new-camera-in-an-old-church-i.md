Of course I wouldn't have needed the OM-D E-M1 Mk II, but isn't it fine to have both cameras with the same resolution?

At that time I had the intention to sell the E-M1 Mk I and the E-P5, but so far I still have both. Why? Well, the prices are ridiculously bad and I didn't bother. Of course it's stupid and I should sell them, because what good is it to have them in a closet?

Anyway. This is not the first image taken with the Mk II, but it's one of the first and it's the first worth publishing. More to come.
