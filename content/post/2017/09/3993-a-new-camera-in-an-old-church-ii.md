I have no idea why I used DxO to process this image. It certainly wouldn't have been necessary. Fact is I did.

As to the camera: both images, yesterday's and today's, are extremely clean and have a lot of dynamic range. I think this camera has more dynamic range than any other Olympus camera and it is extremely sharp as well. 20 megapixels and no low-pass filter make for tremendous image quality. You have to be careful with moiré, but that's normally a very local problem and easy to fix in post. At least I've never had an image that was ruined by unfixable moiré.
