Within a day quite a lot of wet snow had fallen, and a few days later it was aready gone.

Or at least that's what I thought to remember. I don't have taken images daily those days, but from what I see now, we seem to have had at least a month of continually white landscape. Strange how memory fails ðŸ™‚
