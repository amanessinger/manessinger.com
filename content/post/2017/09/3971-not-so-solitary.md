I hope you're not getting bored. Fact is, I didn't, and least of all of doing post-processing. Actually it's a pleasure processing images of such chunks of ice, in order to bring out details that you can't see in reality. When you're there, you just see white. You take the image, hoping to later discover interesting structures. And rather often you do.
