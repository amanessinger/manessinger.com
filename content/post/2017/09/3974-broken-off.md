As a child I would have played in such a place with miniature figurines of soldiers, pretending it was the edge of a giant glacier. I could do that for hours, moving troops, sending air cover, playing battles.

Without any thought of death. War was a game, death was the time between taking a figurine out of the game and positioning it anew. Some people grow old and still have those views. Many of them rule the world.
