How much detail do I need? The PEN-F has 20 megapixels, and with a sharp lens, one like this 75/1.8, I can actually get at the limits of this sensor. Then I crop to a square, which drops me down to 15 megapixels.

Would it be enough to print the images? Well, I've recently used a printing service to make adhesive prints for a few white doors here in Carinthia. They were 70x90 in cm, that is 28x36 in inches. Big enough for a door, decently sized for a wall. Most images used were originally taken with the Nkon D200 (10 megapixels), one with the Panasonic LX5 (10 megapixels) and one with the Nikon D300 (12 megapixels).

I'd say 20 is enough for my use. And even if I'd use them to make billboards, honestly, how close do you get to a billboard?

Of course there are uses for higher resolution cameras, that's OK, and of course when Olympus makes the step to 24, that's the most likely next step, I will likely upgrade and I will surely appreciate the increase in resolution. Don't get me wrong, it will be welcome. It just won't be needed.

Why I say this? Well, it's this image and its abundance of detail ðŸ™‚
