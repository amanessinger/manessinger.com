This image does not exist. If you've seen it, try to burn it from your memory. 

It was taken in Donauzentrum, one of the biggest shopping malls in Vienna. After I've taken this single image, I was approached by a more or less friendly security person and informed that taking images there is not allowed. No explanation was given, other than that I should contact a manager. I didn't bother.

Well, I used to go there on occasion to take an image, and rarely did I leave without buying something. Never since.
