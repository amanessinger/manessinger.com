A lot of words yesterday, no solution, I know. One of the reasons why we don't have a revolution at the heart of the empire is in fact its distributedness. The other reason of course is, that most people here don't have a problem. 

Those who do have problems already walk towards the shores of the Mediterranean, and obviously the problems they have are so grave, that they come, although they likely know that they might not get through. They come, although they know that they are not welcome, because they disturb our peace of mind, by reminding us of the fact, that we are the cause of their problems.

Politicians like our smart young <a href="/2017/07/3918-frost-on-dead-leaves-on-grass" target="_blank">Sebastian</a> talk about holding them back, but in the long run we'll see what that euphemism really means.

Remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics" target="_blank">Boston Dynamics</a>, the robot company bought by Google and then sold on to a Japanese company, likely because their image could only have been seen as detrimental to what Google likes to be seen as? Take their "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE3fmFTtP9g" target="_blank">Wildcat</a>" and you'll have a hard time to not imagine it weaponized. And now imagine thousands of them patrolling the Sahara, controlled by drones with normal and infrared cameras.

Not enough? Here's another one for all those people who say they are not xenophobic and they don't want to hurt anybody, and that we just have to secure our frontiers and build a Fortress Europe: Why not nuke the Sahara? Lay a deadly belt of nuclear hell across the desert. Would work like the perfect fence, right?

But then, of course nobody in the civilized world would do such a thing, That's almost as if someone would have the idea to drop large amounts of poisonous herbicides over the jungle in a foreign country, just because they suspect a supply trail running through there, supplying their enemies in another country that they have no business in. Nobody would do that, right?

Frightening? Sure. Likely? Sure. Anything that can be done is done by our governments. We've painfully learned that since Snowden's and Manning's revelations. And it's not even because they are so evil. They are not. They just try to get reelected, and so they do our bidding and try to keep up our illusion of paradise by hiding the ugly truths.

Exaggerated? I don't think so. I've already heard one of our politicians talk about how important it would be to secure the southern Lybian border, in order to let refugees not even come to the shores of our private swimming pool.
