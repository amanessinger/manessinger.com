Here's another images that I couldn't remember having taken. Looking at the timestamp, I most likely was on the train at that time. Obviously the camera was still an hour off ðŸ™‚

As to the image itself, well, it's one of those unspectacular images that I might have deleted. Instead I tried a B&amp;W conversion and some heavy vignetting, and suddenly it began to look kind of interesting. Ymmv.
