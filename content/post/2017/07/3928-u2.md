... it turns out it also works pretty well in dramatic B&amp;W. What do you prefer?

Actually this is one of the benefits of not blogging images the day they were taken or at least processed. I've created the B&amp;W version just a few minute ago, half a year after the original. It was a sudden idea and I really like the result. Had I blogged it in November, I most likely would never have returned to that particular image.
