A camera is a computer, right? Caputure timestamps are important, right? So, please, can anybody tell me why cameras can't switch between normal and daylight saving time automatically? Yes, there is the matter of location, I know, but if we have point'n'shoots with GPS receiver modules, why can't we have them on expensive system cameras like the PEN-F?

Energy drain? Not really. You could either track location permanently (and have it recorded in your pictures, accepting energy drain) or you could check at least once every 15 minutes as long as the camera is on. 

Of course this image is one hour off, and that quite a few days after we changed from DST to standard time. Oh my!
