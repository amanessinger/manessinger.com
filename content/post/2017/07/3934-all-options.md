U-Bahn, S-Bahn and Ã–sterreichische Bundesbahnen, it's all rail-based transport, it's all public, but it's public in different ways. The latter, the Austrian Federal Railways, are an all-Austrian thing, the U-Bahn, that's Vienna's Underground, and S-Bahn, that's kind of a joint venture between the two. They all have their own signs, and in some places, where their stations overlap, we see all three signs on one post. And if the light is right, there is a nice balance between lit signs and background sky as a bonus ðŸ™‚
