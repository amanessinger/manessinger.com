Color correction for this simple image of red vines in front of a green wall was problematic, to say the least.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20161031_160031_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20161031_160031_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> As far as I remember, the wall was green and the vines were red. So far, so good. How red? How green? The white balance chosen by the camera was way off, so I couldn't rely on that.

I finally settled on 5100 / +10, a little bit cooler than what Lightroom considers "Daylight". Looks good on the wall, maybe a little too warm on the vines, but going cooler makes the wall look off. Otherwise I've adjusted vibrancy and saturation in preference of keeping detail. Maybe it looks well enough, at least that's the best I can do. In any case, this is an image that would need extra treatment for a print.
