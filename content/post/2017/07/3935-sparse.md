Villach does not have a big park. It doesn't need one. It's small enough that you're out of town and in the country in a few minutes.

Villach has a small park though with a fountain in a shallow pool. In autumn, when the pool is already empty and prepared for winter, I like to take photographs there. The russet dead leaves on the blue paint make for a very pleasing color contrast in times when nice colors are often hard to come by ðŸ™‚
