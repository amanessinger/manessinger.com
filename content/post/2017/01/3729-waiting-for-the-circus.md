This is an almost certainly wrong statement. In a way all images lie, and the more a lens deviates from the "normal" range between 35&nbsp;mm and 70&nbsp;mm, the more the image lies. Here the equivalent focal length of 120&nbsp;mm compresses the width of the street away, and it fabricates a connection between the woman most likely waiting for the bus and the circus tent far in the background.
