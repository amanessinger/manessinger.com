Every once in a while something important happens. One of those things was the introduction of USB 3.0. It happened shortly after we bought our last PC in Carinthia. In all that time since, I have endured a PC with painfully slow connections. It was OK for work, it was OK for image processing, but backing up Terabytes of data was beyond annoying. Still, you don't throw away a new computer, and so I used and used it, until it had well grown old. Now, with that PC slowly dying, two disks already gone, I've decided to buy a new one. 

Yes, of course, I have backups of everything important on a four disk RAID NAS, and the failed disks didn't contain anything important, but anyway, it was about time.

My first impulse was to buy a custom PC with a super-fast 1 TB PCIe SSD (a Samsung 960 Pro or something like that), but in the end the convenience of buying a stock Lenovo PC won. Core i7 6700, 16 GB of memory, a 512 GB SSD (SATA only) and, just because it feels good, a super-expensive server hard drive, a 4 TB Western Digital Gold for my image data. What could possibly be wrong with that?
