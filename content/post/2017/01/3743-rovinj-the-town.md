On my short trip to Rovinj, a beautiful small coastal town in Croatia, I used one of my lightest travel kits: the 9-18/4.0-5.6, the 25/1.8 and the plasticky 40-150/4.0-5.6.

The latter is easily the most underestimated lens in my whole lineup. Stopped down to f8 it's sharp, it's incredibly lightweight, and it's very cheap. I've bought it used "as new" for 150 Euros, but you often get it for less than 100. If you don't have it, get it.
