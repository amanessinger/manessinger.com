For a long time I was a Photoshop user, now I'm a Lightroom user. I once wrote a few Photoshop tutorials, but I can't even remember Photoshop's keyboard shortcuts now.

I'm a Lightroom user, but I keep Photoshop around. It's part of the Creative Cloud photography bundle anyway and I use it for the few things that I can't do in Lightroom, like "Edit / Transform / Skew". That happens less than once a month.

The other software that I keep (and actually have acquired not so long ago) is DxO. I use it for pictures like this. I've taken it on the train, I like it in a way, and although the camera's stabilization would have allowed me to get away with ISO 800 and 1/20s (maybe lower with a few tries), I forgot to change to manual mode. The result was ISO 1600 and 1/40s. ISO 1600 is by no means bad on the E-P5, but when I can make it look like ISO 400 using DxO, I'll happily do it. Basically I'm only abusing DxO as a noise reduction plugin for Lightroom, but it's so excellent at that, I'd buy it again any time. Now that I think of it, I might have to, once I switch to the E-M1 MkII ðŸ™‚
