Here's the last image of the library and the first post of 2017. Glad to see you on this side ðŸ™‚

It's not the last image taken in 2016 on this blog. Actually there are more than 300 left. I'll skip a few, I'll have a few posts with more than one image, but expect it to be mid-summer, until you see the first images taken this year. I guess I won't run out of images anytime soon. I may not run out of topics for the occasional rant either. While the former is calming, the latter is ... not.
