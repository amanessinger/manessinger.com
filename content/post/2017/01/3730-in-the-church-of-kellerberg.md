"Kellerberg? Kellerberg?", did I ask myself, "where is Kellerberg?". I had to ask Google, and they told me it's north of Villach, maybe 10 kilometers away.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160709_172859_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 0pt 0px; float: left;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160709_172859_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> It's a small village along the old road. Normally when I drive that way, I take the highway, and the few times that I took the old road, I passed through without even recognizing the village. 

Not so this time. I checked if the church was open, went in, took a few photos, and in the evening I added "Kellerberg" as a keyword in Lightroom. Then I forgot about it ðŸ™‚
