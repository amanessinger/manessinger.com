This is typical for what happens when I use a macro lens for macros ðŸ™‚

It's not that I don't know how one would theoretically approach those subjects, but it's the same as with continuous autofocus and sports photography: I'm not really interested in it, I lack any practice and therefore I also lack any skill. 

Funnily enough, I always buy macro lenses and of course I end up using them for different purposes. Next time it won't be so easy though. A week ago I've ordered a cheap <a href="http://www.zyoptics.net/product/mitakon-20mm-f2-4-5x-super-macro-lens/" target="_blank">Mitakon 20mm f/2 4.5X Super Macro Lens</a>. Ultra high 4.5:1 magnification ratio, but on the other hand it does not focus to infinity. I have no idea what I will use it for. Heaven knows, I may end up using it for real macros, because that seems to be the only way that lens can be used at all ðŸ˜„
