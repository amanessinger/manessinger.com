A small twig with leaves on a white patch of paint on the street. I didn't arrange that, I just saw it. 

Would I? 

Some people do, but even if I don't, it has nothing to do with purism at all. It's not my thing. Photography is a meditative act for me, an act of seeing, not an act of arranging. 

This is not good or bad. In the end both ways of photography are acts of creating. It's just that I find one relaxing and the other tedious. Most of the time.
