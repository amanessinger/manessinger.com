Hmmm ... 60mm lens, 120mm equivalent, this perspective, ... actually I have no idea how I've taken this image. I must have held the camera high above my head, but could I possible have achieved that weird perspective? I didn't levitate (I'd remember that), in that place there is no overlooking vantage point, and I didn't use drones either ðŸ™‚
