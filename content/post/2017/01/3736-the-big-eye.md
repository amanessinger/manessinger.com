Alternatively I could also call this post "The Fisheye" ðŸ™‚

It's interesting: I don't use that lens very often, but I use it regularly. Sure, this image was taken more than five months ago, but I've used my new fisheye every once in a while in between. 

I had one on the Nikon D300, and there it was more of a novelty. I used it for some time and then almost never again. It seems, that in the meantime I have found my way of working with this lens.
