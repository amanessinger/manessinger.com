If you think Orthanc, well, looks close, but you're wrong. Rovinj it is ðŸ™‚

So, now that I have the E-M1 MkII, was it worth it?

Yes and no. Strictly speaking, frankly, no. There is nothing earth-shattering that the new camera can and the old couldn't. If you're happy wih the E-M1 and you consider upgrading, well, you might get an few new things to like, but you won't get anything that opens up new horizons. It's the same, already almost perfect camera with a bit of further perfection. You may like some of it, some of it may come unneeded, but then, if the standard is that high, I refuse to complain ðŸ™‚

I've tried continuous autofocus on cars and people on the street. It works, even impressively so, at least as well as on the Nikon D300 ... and I don't need it. I may not use it ever again ðŸ™‚

High-speed modes? That pre-event "Pro Capture Mode"? I didn't try it and I probably never will.

The most important things for me are the 20 megapixels (finally the same resolution as on the PEN-F). the fact that I can configure the camera to leave "Magnify mode" (14 times magnification as focus aid) upon shutter half-press, The fact that I now can configure manual lenses to be recorded in EXIF, just as I can do it on the PEN-F, and the fact that I have one more fully programmable button.  Yes, it does not sound like much, but those and the few other small improvements all add up. As regards myself, I call this a success.

Is this a recommendation? Let me put it this way: If you look for a new camera and the price does not hurt you, it is certainly one of the best cameras you can possibly get, regardless of price. If you're already set for Micro Four Thirds and you are mostly a stills photographer, you can't get anything better. Panasonic may beat it in the video game, but for stills the E-M1 MkII rules surpreme.

Well, actually, yes, it's a recommendation ðŸ˜„
