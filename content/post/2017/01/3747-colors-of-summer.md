Here's a slightly unusual angle on a hotel. It's one of those buildings originating in communist Yugoslavia and later having been converted to modern 4-star accommodations. If you look very closely, there's still a little shabbiness to be seen here and there, but overall they are fine places to stay in. And look at the colors!
