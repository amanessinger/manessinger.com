Not long ago, during the Yugoslavian War, Rovinj was almost empty - shunned by tourists. Yes, this was 25 years ago (really? oh my!), but you wouldn't believe it when you see it today. 

This has been taken a bit off the night tracks. It's one of the streets leading up to the church, and most people at that time of the evening are busy finding a table in one of the countless but hopelessly overcrowded restaurants.
