Now that's the same church as yesterday, only not molten ðŸ™‚

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160802_200353_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160802_200353_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> The image of the bird is unfortunately not sharp enough to qualify for its own post. Still, the scene is too perfect to throw the image away.

Granted, I've used an unnecessary f9.0, but the focal length is only 100mm (200mm eq.), taken at 1/250s. I should have been able to easily hold that, even without stabilization. Fact is I couldn't - and this is only one out of three images. All were taken with the same technical parameters within seconds and under the same light. I wasn't in a hurry either.

This may be one of the odd combinations of camera body, lens, focal length and shutter speed, where some weird resonance renders the stabilization ineffective. The E-P5 normally has the same stabilization as the original E-M1, but I can't remember ever having seen this with the E-M1 or with any other lens. I think this is what "Anti-Shock" was introduced for. I believe the E-P5 should already have had it, but I may be wrong.
