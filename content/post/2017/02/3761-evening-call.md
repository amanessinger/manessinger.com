I stood a while and took images of this guy. A few seconds later another bird came, they had a short fight and the other bird won. I only have one image of the fight and it's been taken a second too early. The next already shows the other bird in a triumphant position with spread wings, but unfortunately the tip of one wing reaches out of the frame. I've tried it, but there's no way to save that image.

Now that I think of it, the fight of the two birds is a situation where the E-M1 MkII's "Pro Capture Mode" would have been helpful. It wouldn't have saved the image with the cut-off wing, but it would have given me at least one good image of the fight. The only problem is, I wouldn't have been able to set it up in a hurry. 

It seems like I should set up a "Custom Mode" (that's what the old "MySets" are called today). Switching between custom modes is easy as well. They finally have dedicated positions on the mode dial.
