The only way to take this image was from an elevator, through thick sheets of glass. You can imagine the image needed a lot of saturation and contrast in post-processing ðŸ™‚

Hmm, reminds me of some surrealist, maybe a little of Picasso as well. It's amazing what seemingly flat sheets of glass can do to a reflection ðŸ˜„
