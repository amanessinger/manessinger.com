Rovinj, like so many of these old mediterranean cities, wouldn't be my first choice for riding a bicycle. Cobbled, narrow streets full of tourists, much of the city perching on a hill, but hey, I'm just the photographer, and as such I was glad to have a few bikes around. For years they were one of my favorite subjects ðŸ™‚
