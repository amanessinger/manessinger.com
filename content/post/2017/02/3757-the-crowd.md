You may ask yourself, is this the right time to get an E-M1 MkII? Isn't this a little bit late? Should I wait for the next model?

Well, no. If at all, it's still a little bit early. Lightroom only has "preliminary support" for now. It looks good, but the usual Olympus color profiles like "Normal" and "Vivid" are not yet available. Neither is support in DxO. The latter is announced for February. In other words: no need to hurry ðŸ™‚
