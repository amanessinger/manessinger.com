There's nothing new that I could tell you about the E-M1 MkII. I had it with me in Vienna, but I've hardly used it at all. 

At the moment I'm on the train from Vienna to Carinthia. Tonight we had snow in Vienna, but it's already thawing, contrary to the predictions. 

In Carinthia, where we had day-highs of -7 degrees Celsius last weekend (and basically for two weeks), we seem to get +10 and more the next days. Warm and moist air from the Mediterranean, cold air from the north, wherever they meet there'll be snow. I sincerely hope it's north of the Alps ðŸ™‚
