Like in Lisbon I brought the "Big Gear", the E-M1, the trinity of PRO zooms and, because it's so small and easily fit into the bag as well, the 7.5&nbsp;mm fisheye.

Baroque it is. That's the style the fish was created for ðŸ™‚

The fish will never be a "normal" lens for me, but while I used to struggle for seeing its applicability, it now is normal to recognize the moments. It's just another tool.
