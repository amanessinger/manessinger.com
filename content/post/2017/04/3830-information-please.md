Today I've seen <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxBusiness/status/852135930831843329" target="_blank">something that I can't really believe</a>. Can anybody confirm that this is not satire? The journalist, with desire in her eyes, praying to her hero-god? The absurd pseudo-scientific expression of "five-times-better"? "Oh, of course my experts say it's 5.37 times better, but because I'm a humble man I round it down!". And then her question "unmanned"? Yeah sure, this time. Normally our bombs have pilots, but this time we knew they would explode!!!

Please, beg you please, tell me this was satire!
