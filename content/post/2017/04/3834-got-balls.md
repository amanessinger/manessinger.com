That's a wall in a <a href="http://www.pizzaontour.info/cara-mia-hardeggasse/" target="_blank">pizzeria in Vienna</a> near home. They claim to have the best pizza in town, which is clearly wrong. They are very solid performers though, and at least they are the best you can get in my district. Most of the time that's easily good enough. If not, I go <a href="http://www.spottedbylocals.com/vienna/pizza-quartier/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>.
