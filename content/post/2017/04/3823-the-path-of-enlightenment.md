Half a year has gone by since I took these images. I'm pretty thankful for my cache of pictures, because I hardly take images at all right now. Why? Stress, a transitional phase at work, and then I've got my Sony PS4 Pro, remember?

I bought it for making first steps in VR, but in reality I have spent countless hours in "<a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/skyrim/" target="_blank">Skyrim</a>". Meet Astaroth, level 47 conjurer, Archmage of the College of Winterhold, Citizen of Whiterun and Solitude, Dragonborn ðŸ™‚

I've played Skyrim's predecessors "<a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/morrowind/" target="_blank">Morrowind</a>" and "<a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/oblivion/" target="_blank">Oblivion</a>" on the PC, but at the time "Skyrim" came out six years ago, I didn't have a powerful enough graphics card. Today's "Special Edition" brings lots of new visual goodies, and on the PS4 Pro it runs buttery smooth in all its glory.
