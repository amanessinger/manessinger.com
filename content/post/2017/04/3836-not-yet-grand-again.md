This is some Grand Hotel in Prague's Wenceslas Square. The hotel is not yet grand again (but they're busy) and the square is not square at all. It's actually more like a long boulevard. There used to be a horse market in the Middle Ages, and before buying a horse, you could try riding it there. At least that's what I read. Perfectly explains the shape though ðŸ™‚
