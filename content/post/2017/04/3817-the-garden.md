The manual focus 25/0.95 Mitakon Speedmaster is a lens that feels and looks good on the PEN-F. I think in the meantime they sell it in silver as well, and that would be an even better match. The fate of the early adopter ğŸ™‚

Of course in an image like this, any lens would do. Had I used the Olympus 25/1.8, I'd even be able to tell you the aperture I've used. Must have been around f2.8, I guess.
