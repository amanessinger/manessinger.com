In fall 2008 we moved from "the country" to Villach. There we spent three years in one apartment until we finally moved to where we live now. 

In a way I miss living in the country. I took many, many more images of trees, flowers and landscapes there. No wonder, but ...

Today we have an exception. This tree is a hundred meters off the main road entering Villach from the south, maybe 150 meters further on is our apartment block. It's near all shops, it's only minutes to the next five supermarkets and so on, but it is almost as silent and rural as "in the country".

Still, it makes a difference whether you only drive by those trees or if they grow in your garden. You give more attention to those in your garden ðŸ™‚
