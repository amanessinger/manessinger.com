It won't have escaped your attention, I was in Prague last year, and you can be sure there's more to come. 

Weather was much less than ideal, far from how beautiful it was in Lisbon the year before, but I still got away with a lot of material. I finally ended up with 104 processed images. I won't strech them one per post until mid-summer, but I suppose we'll need almost two months to wade through.
