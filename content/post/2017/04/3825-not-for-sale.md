Nice chandelier, huh? Seen in Vienna's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_Church,_Vienna" target="_blank">Votivkirche</a>, a church having been "in renovation" for more than 10 years now, still far from being reopened as a church. I was there to see an exhibition of photographic reproductions of Michaelangelo's frescos in the Sixtine Chapel.

Frankly, the exhibition was disappointing. I've seen the real thing and there is nothing new to be learned from the images. Well, if anything at all, then that even large format film can't be blown up endlessly without looking blurry ðŸ™‚
