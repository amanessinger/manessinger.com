Prague, the third-largest city in Europe, immediately after Rome and Constantinople. When? At the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" target="_blank">Emperor Charles IV</a> (1346â€“1378), long before Contantinople fell to the Turks, more than a hundred years before the Age of Discoveries, almost a hundred years after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Crusade" target="_blank">the last crusade</a>, long before Renaissance, in the outgoing Middle Ages. Trade with India and China went through its traditional routes across Middle East and along the Silk Road. It was a time when Christopher Columbus' grandfather may just have been born.

Not many cities can claim a history like that.
