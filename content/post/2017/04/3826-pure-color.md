This church is pretty dark, and the patterns of colored light coming in through the stained-glass windows can be breathtaking. They are not very gentle to your sensor though. The JPEG directly from the camera was worthless, this conversion from RAW is quite decent though. I think I'm satisfied with the PEN-F's dynamic range.
