I've used DxO Optics Pro for this image. I could have done it to de-fish the picture, but that's not what I'm after. If I want ultra-wide and recti-linear, I just use an appropriate lens.

No, it's that I used 1/100&nbsp;s and ISO&nbsp;1250. The advantage is, that I've frozen the escalator's movement, and although everything up to ISO&nbsp;3200 would be perfectly OK for an image like this, I routinely use DxO for everything above 400. It's not necessary and nobody will peep at pixels, but then, there is more to DxO's PRIME noise reduction than noise reduction. Color accuracy, dynamic range, they are all better than with Lightroom. They'd better be so, given that Lightroom renders in real-time and DxO takes half a minute for an image.
