I drove around randomly, worrying about the sun, and suddenly I found rows of trees with strangly red fruit, planted around one of Villach's schools. 

No leaves, only thousand of red berries. In size they almost approximated cherries, but they were densely clustered along the twigs. Some of them were already foulish brown, many were still in red splendor. Any idea what that is?
