Yesterday my friend <a href="http://imagefiction.blogspot.com/">Ted Byrne, Artist and blogger from Lancaster, PA</a>, was here in Vienna and I've shown him a few places. We've talked a lot about politics, art and of course photography. Black and white vs color was among our topics, and this is one more example for why I use B&amp;W:

The image simply didn't work in color. First there was not much color to begin with, and then I had to selectively push exposure and increase contrast, for instance to bring out the structure of the reflections on the lower side of the blades. That's the kind of operation that ruins every color consistency and, frankly, it also raises noise. None of that is a problem in B&amp;W.
