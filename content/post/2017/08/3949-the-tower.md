This is Vienna's City Hall. Once I've worked a hundred meters from there, until four years ago our office was moved into an outer district on the other side of river Danube. 

The old office building should have been demolished long ago and already been replaced by a shiny new one, but seemingly office space does not sell that well in Vienna or the price was not right. Finally, any day now, the demolition should start.
