In all these images I used my ultra-wide at its widest, and I went pretty close to the subject. Processing-wise the challenge is to bring out color variation and contrast. 

In earlier times I would have used LAB color mode in Photoshop. It's an ideal tool for removing casts and making images more vivid. Turns out I can't do it any more. Photoshop has completely changed since I used to write tutorials, and the the things that have not changed are long forgotten ðŸ™‚
