Pretty nice, right? Of course this is not a really old church. In a way these late 19<sup>th</sup> century churches, with their architecture always mimicking some historic style, could well be dismissed as kitsch, but on the other hand I like to think that a church does have a purpose as well.  

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20160820_165014-Edit_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20160820_165014-Edit_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> If a church of roughly similar looks fit that purpose 800 years ago, I see no reason why the style shouldn't fit the purpose today. Or, look at it this way, if we accept that Yellowstone can be the subject of images after Ansel Adams, why shouldn't we accept Neo-Romanesque or Neo-Gothic architecture? 

Anyway, I like churches to be bright, and this one surprised me pleasantly.
