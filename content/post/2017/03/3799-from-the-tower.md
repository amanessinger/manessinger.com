F11 is unusable on Micro Four Thirds, they say. Well, I say if you must, you must. In this case I had to. Here I'm standing on the lookout platform of the observation tower on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidenkogel" target="_blank">Pyramidenkogel</a> in Carinthia. It's on top of a free-standing mountain and has a breath-taking view over central Carinthia and its lakes. Look at <a href="/2006/10/14-yesterday-is-here_116204551517619555.html" target="_blank">this sample</a> from my blog, posted 11 years ago.

Today's is a rather uncommon view directly down on the parking area. The red thing in the upper-left corner is a signal light a meter from the camera, the ground is 90 meters below. There was nothing to conveniently focus on between the two.
