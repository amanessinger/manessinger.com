I have no idea what they do when suddenly rain comes falling, but I found the idea of having that furniture out on the street pretty charming ðŸ™‚

By the way, I'm writing this on March 8 and yesterday Adobe released new versions of ACR and Lightroom with full support for the E-M1 MkII (among others). Sweet! I can again choose from the Olympus camera profiles (like "Standard" or "Vivid") as starting points.
