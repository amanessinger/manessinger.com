All the images that I made on Pyramidenkogel's observation tower are of the rather non-touristic type. This is home-turf, a place where I can come back any time I like (although I normally don't do it), and this puts me in a different seeing mode. Not that I don't see or look for that type of images when on vacation, but in other countries, in places that I'm not likely to visit again, at least part of my attention is on documenting.
