No battleship without a cannon, right? Well, this one looks like I would have imagined the Enterprise's Phaser cannons in my childhood. 

Star Trek was my favorite TV show in elementary school and we played it in all our breaks. My mother had sewn badges that we pinned to our shirts, my father had created wooden phaser pistols.

I was Captain Kirk, my best friends were Spock and Scotty, a girl that I secretly adored was Uhura, but now I wonder who played Dr McCoy. This all stopped when I changed school at 10, and many of them I haven't seen any more. "Scotty", who in reality became a doctor, died a few years ago. Strange to think that he is only a memory now.
