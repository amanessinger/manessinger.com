Before I began taking photographs, I played a lot of computer games and even made two maps for the game Unreal Tournament 2004. I spent lots of money on graphics cards and fast computers.

Then all changed. Today I don't even have a computer capable of playing current games. Ten years old "Half Life 2" runs pretty well on my Mac, but forget about "Far Cry 4" or anything like that.

Two weeks ago I bought a Playstation 4 Pro. I did it mostly for VR, but - as everybody else has likely found out - there are not that many good VR games currently on the market. 

The seemingly best one is "Resident Evil 7", a horror game that lets you creep through a decrepit house somewhere far away from any other people than the members of a psychopathic family who are out to kill you. It's all dark, dirty, mouldy and full of insects. Guess what? I am not interested ðŸ™‚

The VR game that I did buy is "Eagle Flight". Here's an in-game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TJdTB5qQjA" target="_blank">video on YouTube</a>. Basically you're a bird and you fly over and through a Paris without people, reclaimed by nature. 

The game has a great and intuitive control system that lets you fly wherever you look. Tilt your head to the right and you make a turn to the right, tilt to the left and turn left. It's that easy. There are only two buttons on the controller, one to accelerate, one to slow down.

That's exactly what I was looking for. I think VR works great for horror ("Jump in your face" was never so real), but it also works great for flying. My preference is clear, I prefer flying ðŸ™‚
