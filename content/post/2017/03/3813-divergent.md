And here it is, my snobbism. Along with the PEN-F I've used the all-metal 12/2.0 (yesterday's image) and the all-metal 17/1.8 (today's image). You can be sure that the third lens in my bag was the 75/1.8. It's not because I needed those lenses, it's just because they look gorgeous on that most beautiful camera that Olympus has ever produced ðŸ™‚
