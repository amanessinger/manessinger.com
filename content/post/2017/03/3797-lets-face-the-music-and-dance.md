This is my last image taken in Maribor. All in all I can say is, that I was surprised by how lovely this small city is. Maribor is actually not far from home, but it is in that unfortunate zone that is a little bit too far to drive there for a coffee, but on the other hand so near that most of the time we drive by to another destination. It shares that fate with Udine or Ljubljana. The question is always: "Why not drive a little bit further and down to the sea?". Well, this time we didn't and I'm glad about it ðŸ™‚
