A few times in my childhood I remember having used such a bus. Is that scary?

If you experience something like that, thoughts about age are not that uncommon, I guess. How about this one: I'll be 70 in 17 years. 

Today I am closer to being 70, than to the year I was finally getting my master's degree - and I was late at that.

I am closer to being 80, than I am to the year when I started working as a programmer.

I am closer to being 100, than I am to the year when I started elementary school.

It's very unlikely that my father gets 82. Practically no male in his family did. We like to think of 50 as "Half Time", but but in reality that's not even close for most of us.

Scary? Yes ðŸ™‚
