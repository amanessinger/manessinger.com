It's interesting to see how things change. This is one of a few high-rise buildings that have been built around Vienna's new central railway station. Some of the architecture is boring, some is interesting, and sometimes even the boring gets interesting when seen from the right angle.

In any case the whole area looks strangely empty. There's no organically grown infrastructure, and when you leave the immediate vicinity of the station, you are alone on empty sidewalks.
