This was the my first time in Brixen / Bressanone. I'm 53. I may visit the town once more in my life, but I'm not sure. It's not because I didn't like what I saw (much to the contrary!), it's because the world is too big and too beautiful.

The cloister is full of beautiful imagery. Stories over stories. I've taken a few pictures, and the framing was more determined by my compositional style than by anything content-related. It's sad in a way: I most likely won't ever see more of those stories than I do now, when I look at my images. It's also true that I did not concentrate on seeing while I was there. I concentrated on framing.

But then: I've been in places where I didn't take images, places where I did concentrate on seeing, and now all is lost, all is gone from my memory. These images at least will remain.
