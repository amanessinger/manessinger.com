I've seen this peculiar kind of presentation before, and I've even taken an image of it. I also know that I've seen it recently, but quickly scrolling through the pictures of up to 2009, I thought I've missed it and gave up.

In the end I searched my own blog for posts with the tag "mannequin", and sure enough, among the first hits it was, "<a href="/2013/06/2422-you-keep-me-hangin-on.html">2422 â€“ You Keep Me Hanginâ€™ On</a>", taken in Villach in 2013. Looks like a pretty good reason to keep blogging, if you ask me ðŸ™‚
