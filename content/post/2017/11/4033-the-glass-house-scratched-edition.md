A few days ago I've looked at the stats of this blog on Statcounter.com. Oh my! It's really good that I don't care any more ðŸ˜„

Basically it's at around 30 average daily unique visits with 33.5 average page views. In 2009 that were 158 and 200, and when I ran tutorials or gear reviews, then I had highs between 3k and 4k on certain days. 

I don't do that any more and it shows. On the other hand, you can do only so many things in a short life time. Why waste it on always the same? 

Again, I don't care. There is no magic in accumulating hits. It's just providing content that people want to see, promoting that content, and putting lots of work into it. And that exactly is what I currently don't want to do ðŸ™‚

It's not even the work, it's the content as well. Content people want to see, that is frequently not content that I want to produce. Sure, I could write reviews, especially of exotic pieces of equipment, that hardly anyone writes about. For instance I have bought a <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/6735804640/new-20mm-f2-4-5x-macro-lens-released-by-mitakon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mitakon 20mm F2 4.5x macro lens</a> in January.

It's probably one of my less successful purchases, because when I found out that it can't focus beyond a few centimeters, I put it back into its box and on a shelf. There it's collecting dust. I could as well have put it on a camera, the camera on a tripod, and then started to get creative with flowers or all kinds of small objects. It would have made an interesting review, and for such an exotic lens it would likely have been one of only a handful of reviews on the Internet.

Hmm ... it even begins to sound interesting, but don't count on it ðŸ˜„
