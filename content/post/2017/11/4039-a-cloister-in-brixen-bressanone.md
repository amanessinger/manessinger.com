Here we are, that was the reason why we went there: the cloister.

I think what DxO did all by itself looks better than what I did in Lightroom, therefore the DxO version became Image of the Day.

I had the idea to invoke DxO, because due to the extreme contrast and how I had to pull up the shadows, noise began to creep in. DxO is my panacea for everything noise-related ðŸ˜‰
