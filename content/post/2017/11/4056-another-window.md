This window is in Trieste, Italy. We were there for a few days in May. Trieste is one of those cities near your home that you always fail to visit. They are too near for proper vacations and too far for a day trip. They have some sights, but they are not full of spectecular ones.  There always seems to be a more luring place to go. Unless you go there. This time we went.
