Trieste was an Austrian city for some time and you see it. For me much of the architecture is extremely familiar. 

Trieste is also a city at the sea. It's only the Adriatic, and of that only the northern shore, but nevertheless, the sea is the sea. It is big enough for the opposite shore, the eastern side of the Italian penninsula, to vanish below the horizon. And that's what counts.
