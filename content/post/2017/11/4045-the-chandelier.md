Now that I think of it, I have no idea how old these chandeliers in old churches really are. Obviously this one is electric. I wonder when it was that it replaced a predecessor, that still carried real candles. And what did that predecessor look like? When was it lit for the last time? And how long did it take? Did they have to use a ladder or were they able to lower the chandelier?
