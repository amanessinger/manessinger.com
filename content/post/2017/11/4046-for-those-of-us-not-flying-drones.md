Have you ever flown a drone? I certainly didn't, although I think I could afford one. But then, I have pretty high expectations when it comes to the quality of still photography, and on the other hand I am not at all interested in creating videos. Seems like I'd want to fly a drone that could be able to carry one of my Olympus cameras, or at least something of similar quality. Maybe, after all, I can't afford a drone ðŸ˜„
