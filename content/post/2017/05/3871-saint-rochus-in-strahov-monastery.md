Saint Rochus is something like the "spare church" in Strachov Monastery. It's a gallery today and when I was there, they had classic modern paintings on display. Chagall, Ernst, that kind.

Well, the paintings were interesting, but what really fascinated me was the church with its blank, white walls. Mesmerizing.
