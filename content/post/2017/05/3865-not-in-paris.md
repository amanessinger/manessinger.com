This is <a href="https://www.pragueexperience.com/places.asp?PlaceID=604" target="_blank">Pet&#345;&iacute;n Lookout Tower</a> (Pet&#345;&iacute;nsk&aacute; rozhledna), a smaller cousin of Paris' Eiffel tower, built only two years later. There's a restaurant at the base and a long spiral stairway along the spine. It does not look like it, but the spine even contains an elevator.

I could have managed the stairway up, but I was curious and took the elevator instead. I was lucky, but you might have to wait in a row. Down I took the stairs and I suggest you do so as well, at least in one direction.
