Vtraba Garden is built into the steep side of a hill. Terraces are connected by stairs, and the whole ensemble is a microcosm of baroque taste.

Most of them favor size and control of nature over actual beauty. Think of Versailles or Vienna's Sch√∂nbrunn. This one's the exception.

When you enter the garden, it is extremely steep and it looks very small. It's a work of Art though. Each view is carefully designed, everything is controlled, but in a very playful way. When being in Prague, this is truely a place that must not be missed.
