There's a hill on the western side of Prag. You can either take a cog railway up or just walk. I decided to walk. Multiple ways first meander through meadows with a progessively more impressive view across the city, often connected by stairs. The last part crosses a forest, and there I found a big block of mossy sandstone with all sorts of tags carved into it. Generations seem to have left their tags. This is one of them.
