Yeah, I know, don't tell me: I'm milking Saint Nicholas. At least this will be the last wide-angle image of the church ðŸ™‚

But then: isn't it beautiful? It took quite some preprocessing, I've played a little bit with the colors, but basically that's what it feels like to stand up there and looking across this gorgeous hall.
