This is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge" target="_blank">Charles Bridge</a>, where you see tourists all through the day and most of the night. It's the most famous and most beautiful connection between Old Town and Lesser Quarter.

I really like the colors in this image. Of course they are completely faked, but they look natural nevertheless.

What I did was to go down with the color temperature all the way until the wall of the tower in the middle looked good. I can't remember exactly, but I must have taken out a lot of blue, though that still left me with a lot of greenish ghostly yellow. A drastic shift of the yellows towards red did the trick. DxO's PRIME noise reduction took care of noise and color purity. Again, I think the result looks vivid and natural. Not at all the fake that it is ðŸ™‚
