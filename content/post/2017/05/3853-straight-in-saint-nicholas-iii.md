Today's the 8<sup>th</sup> of May, for some among my fellow citizen still a controversial date. It's the day Nazi Germany surrendered in 1945. 

Almost every city has a street named after the date, but for many it was always seen as a Day of Defeat rather than the day Austria got back its freedom. Every year we still see functionaries of the so-called Freedom Party (FPÃ–) gather that day to "remember the victims", which is a mostly a euphemism for remembering the "Good Old Days".
