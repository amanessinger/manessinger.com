That's one of those typical images where I relish my camera's depth of field. The colors are heavily pushed though. In reality it was exceedingly drab and I couldn't stand it.

Actually I prefer color, but this may because the image is a memory for me as well. My memories tend to be colorful. Even of drab days ðŸ™‚
