This is the same church as yesterday's but today we are inside. And again: the fisheye is exceedingly well suited for baroque architecture, especially when you shoot just straight up into a cupola.

<a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2016/20161024_113259-Edit_lr.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0px 0pt 10px; float: right;" src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0150x0150/2016/20161024_113259-Edit_lr.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a> Interestingly enough it works as well when straight lines begin to bend. There are so many curves, it doesn't matter if we have some more.

By the way, both of these pictures have been processed with "Edit / Skew" in Photoshop. Standing in the church, bending backwards and trying to get a perfectly symmetric shot is so hard that I prefer to add perfection after the fact ðŸ˜›
