I also had not intended to take pictures, but after I tentatively tried one and nobody stepped in to stop the copyright violation, I took a few more.

I don't even know how old the images are. From the style I'd say not earlier than 1870, but there is no reason why they couldn't be much younger. I simply don't know and Strachov's website only mentions one DÃ¼rer, lots of Baroque and 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> century bohemian landscapes.
