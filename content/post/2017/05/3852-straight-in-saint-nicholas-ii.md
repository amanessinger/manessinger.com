Rectilinear lenses are so much easier to use than fisheyes. They exaggerate the corners, while the view through a fisheye comresses everything near the edges. This makes it much harder to compose precisely. A good viewfinder helps (and the E-M1's is very good), but when viewing a fisheye image on the monitor, you're almost guaranteed to find flaws.
