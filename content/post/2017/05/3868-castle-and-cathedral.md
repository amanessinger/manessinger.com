The hill with castle and cathedral is Hrad&ccaron;any, or actually that's the name of the quarter connecting on its western side. From Pet&#345;&iacute;n Lookout Tower I took the way down towards north-west to Strahov Monastery.

This image at 24mm (48mm effectively) has a very natural perspective, this is what it looks like to be up there. Nice.
