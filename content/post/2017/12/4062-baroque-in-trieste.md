I have stopped tagging images the same day that I've taken them. It's too much work. I still tend to tag them with country and city immediately after import, but that's pretty much all I do. Half a year later (like now) I sit and wonder what church this could be.

Does it matter? Not very much. This is baroque, an already quite international style. Yes, I know, the spanish and latin american variant can look very much different, but everywhere else it's by and large the same.
