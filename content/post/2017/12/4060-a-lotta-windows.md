Like Lisbon, Trieste has a big main square at the sea front. It's not as big and impressive as Lisbon's, but you get the idea. At the far side you see the City Hall, an actually pretty beautiful building, I think. Well, forget the tower for a moment (although you'll see a few details of it), just look at the sheer amount of window area. Looks like steel has been used to stabilize the frame. Otherwise the windows would have to be smaller, I think.

Well, indeed, it was built between 1872 and 1875, says Wikipedia. Seems I could be right.
