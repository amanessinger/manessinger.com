Did I say something about seriously mixed styles? Well, this church has them all ðŸ™‚

Not only that. You also have to cope with extremely mixed light and a variety of color temperatures. 

From above though the windows you get cold blue light, while the artificial light on the altars is extremely warm. In all of these images I have used gradients with different color temperatures to cope with that. All processing has been done in Lightroom.
