In Trieste there's not much flat space between the sea and the hills. That and the innumerous one-way streets make driving by car ... let's say ... challenging. Navigating public transport may not be easy either. Of course you can walk, but then you may not only have to expect a few stairs, you'll also be surprised by how long a stretch the city is.
