After Passo di Falzarego, we descended to Arabba, a typical
small winter sports town. We just passed through, there was
nothing of interest. This is one of the two images I made,
not of the town, but of infrastructure. Today it's a
high-voltage power line. Again black and white, again
because of bad light.
