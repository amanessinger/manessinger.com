I didn't get a good picture of Drei Zinnen in good light,
but I think this one of a similar rock formation is not bad.
There could have been some decorative clouds, but other than
that I am satisfied.

By the way, the big panorama of yesterday's should be up on
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/) by
now. Still not the full size, because that exceeds Flickr's
size limits, but much bigger than the biggest size on my
blog.
