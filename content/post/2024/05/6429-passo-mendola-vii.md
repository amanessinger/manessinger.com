It must habe been nice sitting here and drinking coffee or
local wine. Basically we are directly above Kaltern and
Kalterer See, one of the most famous wine regions in South
Tyrol. A light, red wine, that had its time of mass
production (like practically every wine in Austria), but is
of high quality today (like in Austria :smile:).
