There were lots of interesting place along this steep and
winding road up Passo Mendola. The only problem is, you
can't stop the car. This is one of those famous
South-Tyrolean motorcycle routes, and it is also frequented
by bicycles. After all, Italy is a bicycle sports nation.
The road is narrow, the rocks are steep, and most of the
time you see an option to stop, another car blocks the spot.

It is what it is. This is Europe: beautiful but populated. On
the other hand: we have no rattlesnakes, no crocodiles and
no polar bears. If your car breaks down, you don't die of
thirst and don't get eaten by wildlife, you call for help
with a mobile, walk to the next inn and drink a beer :smile:
