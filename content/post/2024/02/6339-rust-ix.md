Rust is at the shore of a lake, Neusiedler See. Well, at
least that's what's called a lake and a shore in Burgenland.
The lake has a surface of 315 kmÂ², is nowhere deeper than
two meters, and the water is muddy. While wading in water
reaching only to my knees, the immediate danger to my camera
was negligible. The water's color let me opt for black &amp;
white though :grin:
