It's a pretty thick wall. Could you design it? Well, I
certainly couldn't. I've learned my share of math, I've been
at a technical high school, I've even calculated simple
building statics at school, but this is not simple at all.
And even if I'd know the math, it would all depend on the
materials. 

There will certainly be steel in the wall, will it? What
steel? How do you make it? How do you know that you've
managed to create the desired quality? Where do you get the
iron ore? How do you mine it? How do you even know what iron
ore is? Do you know what it looks like? Do you know where to
find it, how to extract it? How do you transport it and how
will you create the temperatures necessary to melt it? And
then? Cast iron is brittle. A smith would know how to make
steel. Do you? Do you know any smith? Even if, we don't talk
about ploughs or swords, we talk about uniform bars with
certain stability-enhancing profiles and lengths of tens of
meters. Thousands of them, each weighing a ton, all having
reliable quality. You can't just make that with hammer and
anvil :smile:

We've only talked about a small part of necessary materials
yet. What about building the wall? Where do you get the
machines? How do you power them? Can you safely build such a
wall without sacrificing thousands of workers? Do you have
proper incentives to make workers work voluntarily and
without forcing them?

Such a dam creates a lot of electricity at times when it is
needed: in winter, at night. It is important to have a few
of them, in order to maintain a steady supply of energy.
There is a tremendous social value in having a steady supply
of energy, but it is kind of an abstract goal to build a dam
for a storage lake. It's not like building one's own house.
Do you have a population, that is educated enough to strive
for such shared goals? Finance them?

Even in the best of cases: constructing such a building will
involve certain dangers. Some people will get hurt. Do you
have the ambulance cars or helicopters to drive or fly them
to the hospital? Do you even have hospitals? Medical
doctors? Emergency rooms? Antibiotics?

That's what the freedom- and gun-loving preppers don't get:
when civilizations go down, all knowledge goes down. So does
technology. After the apocalypse, you can't just rebuild.

Knowledge will be gone, skills will be gone, machines will
be gone, power supply will be gone, heating will be gone and
so will be cooling. Most food will be rotten in weeks.

We will lack the materials, we will lack the knowledge to
use them, and we will lack the knowledge and infrastructure
to re-acquire what we've lost. That's why we'll lose more,
that's why the fall will be so deep.
