This is one of the images I processed immediately after
arriving home. I normally do that, to have at least some
orientation in my Lightroom catalog of the current year.

It's funny how different I used to process images only four
years ago. It looks good, there's no problem with it, but I
suppose it would look less ... homogeneous ... today.
