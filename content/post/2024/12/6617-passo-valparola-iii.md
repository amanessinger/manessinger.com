Looks innocent? In practice, this image was hard to process,
due to the insane contrast. Of course, you can use some HDR
mode, but I really prefer doing images like this the
old-fashioned way. 

Lots of masks here, but all done in Lightroom. For
processing photos, there's hardly a need to go to photoshop
anymore.
