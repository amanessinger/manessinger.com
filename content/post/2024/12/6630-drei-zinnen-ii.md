And here we are again. I had speculated about being at this
mountain at or around sunset. After all, you can't visit
South Tyrol without a proper image of this iconic mountain
group, can you? 

Turned out we could. In the end, we already felt the drag of
the long travel across mountain passes. Eager to get home,
we passed with another mediocre image.
