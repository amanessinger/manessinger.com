This is an image, that is impossible to take. At 12 mm, I
had to shoot at an angle upwards. It's not that you can't
fix the resulting distortions, but you normally lose a lot.
Just like in this version:

<div class="center"><a target="_blank" href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2020/20200907_134207_lr.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2020/20200907_134207_lr.jpg" /></a></div>

In the end I've fixed it with generative fill in Photoshop.
The right side was easy, the left took me quite a few
attempts.

Sure, it's invented, but it's plausible, and it's in those
parts of the image, that nobody ever looks at. At least as
long as they are not miissing. From now on, I'll do this
routinely and without any bad conscience :grin:

Still, from now on, images altered with generative AI will
be tagged `generative-ai`.
