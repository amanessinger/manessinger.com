In Italian, the castle we saw yesterday, Fischburg, is
actually named after the valley and the pass that the valley
leads to: Gardena. We're driving across Passo Gardena
(Gr√∂dner Joch) now. As always, it's not ease to tell exactly
where each image was taken.

There is a mountain called Wolkenstein (Cloudstone), and if
it is not this exact one, honestly I think it should be
:grin:
