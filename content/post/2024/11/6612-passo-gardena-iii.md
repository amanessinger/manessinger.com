The same view direction as yesterday's detail, only this
time a wider angle. It's funny, I didn't recognize it when
processing the images, and I think I've not processed them
at the same day. This one is much more colorful, even in the
right upper spot, from where I took the detail. Had I
recognized it, I'd have tried to match them.
