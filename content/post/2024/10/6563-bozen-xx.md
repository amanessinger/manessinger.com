The guy on the pedestal was not emperor nor king, just a
minstrel, albeit the German-speaking world's most famous
one, Walther von der Vogelweide.

The picture is actually ... bad. I don't know what I was
thinking. I should obviously have stood a meter or two to
the left, in order to get a better rhythm of tower and
statue. As it is, it's embarrassing :stuck_out_tongue:

Anyway, weather was a mess, I remember the two tourists
sticking in that position endlessly, and the red car was
annoying as well.
