The day before, we had missed Lana and its famous
Schnatterpeck altar. It had been on the way from Meran, but
it was late and I think it began raining when we left Meran.

On the road towards Lana, we came through Terlan. We didn't
know anything about the church, but I decided to stop and
have a peek. Glad I did :grin:
