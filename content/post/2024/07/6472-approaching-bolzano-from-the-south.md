And so we returned to Bolzano. Between a third and a half of
the way is Salurn, and these are the ruins of Haderburg.
There's a restaurant today, called "Haderburgsch√§nke zum 18.
Fass". I haven't been there, I only found it on Google Maps
when looking for that rather characteristic ruin. In my
memory, it had been very close to or almost in Bolzano :grin:
