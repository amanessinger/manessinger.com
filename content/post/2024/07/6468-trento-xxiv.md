I'm not sure where this is. It's some detail, and I can't
locate it on Street View. Anyway, it's not far away from the
last spot, because was taken only 11 seconds later :grin:

Oh, yes, after some searching, I found it at the same
crossing, the last house in Via San Pietro. It's on the wall
of the second floor above a jeweler's shop. I don't know
why, but somehow it's satisfying finding such details four
years later.
