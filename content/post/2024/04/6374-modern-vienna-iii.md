You can't take a wide-angle image of a mirror-clad building
without distracting reflections. Here the problem was
two-fold:

The colors of the neighboring buildings clashed with the
color of glass and sky. It completely distracted from the
shape of the office building.

The other thing is, that these reflective windows have a
certain thickness. Vertically, along "meridians", if I may
borrow this term, they are aligned in a plane. Note though,
that my angle of view through the glass depends on the
height of the individual pane. 

Imagine a ray cast from the camera to a lower pane. It does
not cut through the pane at a right angle, but let's assume
it is 80 degrees. When it enters the glass, it runs through
the glass for a certain length, slightly longer then the
thickness of the glass.

The ray through a window at the top will enter at a much
smaller angle, and its way through the glass will be longer.

Now two things happen: glass has a color, and the longer the
ray's way through the glass, the more it is tinted by the
glass. On the other hand, there is the independent effect of
more reflections with smaller angles. The latter is also
moderated by the reflectiveness of the glass.

These two effects cancel each other.  In the lower parts,
the color change in the glass is dominant, but the higher
you get, the more the reflected sky begins to dominate. The
net effect is, that the color of the glass seems to change
with height.

And here you have them, my reasons for going black and
white. 

In other images, without reflections of other buildings, I
usually go the route of linear gradients with shifts of
color temperature and contrast. It's wrong, but it looks
right. In this case I happily went black and white :grin:
