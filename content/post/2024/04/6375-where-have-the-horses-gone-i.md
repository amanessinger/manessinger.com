The modern building you saw in the last three posts is one
of those, that cut into Krieau. The area once was
exclusively reserved for horse racing, and to be precise,
harness racing. Gallop racing took place in Freudenau, about
two kilometers downstream.

There are still races from time to time, but it's not the
wildly popular sport anymore. As a consequence, residential
towers and office buildings eat into the grounds. There is
just too much money in that.
