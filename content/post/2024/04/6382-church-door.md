I couldn't remember where the church with this door was, but
Google's timeline and the timestamp of the image saved me
from the embarrassment. 

The church is [Sankt Othmar unter den
Weißgerbern](https://st-othmar.at/). Weißgerber is German
for Currier, which again is a special subgroup of tanners.
We're near Donaukanal on the downstream side relative to the
historic center. Tanning needs water and produces stench.
That's why.

The image is in black and white, because it had no
attractive color differences at all :smile:
