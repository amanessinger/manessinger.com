Toblach is the German name, Dobbiaco the Italian one. When
South Tyrol fell to Italy, many places had no Italian name
at all. They were deep in exclusively German-speaking
territory. Names had to be invented.

Many a bomb has been thrown about those matters 60 years
ago, but, by all means, things have been resolved. They always
do. It's Europe. There's not even a border. There is a sign
telling you that you leave Austria, and there's another sign
welcoming you to Italy. That's it. Everybody makes business
with everyone. Just like it should be.
