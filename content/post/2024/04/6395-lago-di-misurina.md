An interesting, small lake, but yes, this is the only image.
It was almost impossible to find a place for the car, and
there were so many people, cars and motorbikes, that it
wouldn't have made sense to look for a better point of view
anyway. It's a place you have to be in at a certain time of
day, in good weather and without tourists. This is close to
impossible :grin:

I'm repeating myself? Yes, I know, but really, it's that hard.
