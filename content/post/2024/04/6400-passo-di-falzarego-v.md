I wanted to use this image in order to keep it in my memory.
I tend to remember images, that I've processed and later
written about. This was not an easy one, and I had to use
various masks for a manual "dehaze". It's not perfect, but it
will do as a memory. Probably more of the tedious process
than of the place, but then, oh well :grin:
