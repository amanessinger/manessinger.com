Actually, the term "most dramatic" is always to be seen
relative to the lens used. This is the 7-14/f2.8, and, well,
this gave me some more options :grin:

Remember what I said about reflections, the color of glass
and the angle of view on reflective buildings? This image
and the previous are examples of how I normally solve the
problem. It's not what things look like in reality, but for
my purpose of abstraction it's superior.
