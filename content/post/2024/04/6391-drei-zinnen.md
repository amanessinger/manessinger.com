"Drei Zinnen" is one of the most iconic mountains in South
Tyrol. On our way, we passed it from two sides. Actually we
didn't intend to take a good image of it. Millions have been
taken, and in order to make an impact, you'd have to stay
there at the right time of the year, the right time of day,
be lucky to have the right weather, probably with
interesting clouds and so on. You'd do so with lots of other
photographers, and you'd try to not get into each other's
way.

We just wanted to drive an interesting route towards
Bozen-Bolzano, and we wanted to arrive at our hotel at
daytime.
