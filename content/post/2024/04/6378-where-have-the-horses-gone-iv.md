What do I think about it? Is that tragic? Just as things change?

Well, I think unrestricted capitalism turns every city in
the world into an equal of one of the most boring cities in
the US. Pick one from the popular lists on the Internet.

Cheap architecture always wins, and cheap architecture never
preserves a place's intrinsic character. Once it's lost,
it's lost.

Good architecture is better, but with enough Calatrava
buildings, every city becomes Valencia. Take a few other
star architects, Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, etc., and you find
their buildings all over the world. Rich places tend to
accumulate them, but again, that makes all rich places
visually similar.

In my opinion, a city needs to protect its characteristic
styles. If it does not, it will have lost its attraction to
tourists. It might still be a good place to live, but in
most cases of municipal neglect, it won't even be that.
