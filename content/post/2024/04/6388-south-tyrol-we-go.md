On vacation again. This is a series about a week in what we
loosely call _South Tyrol_. It's a part of Italy with a
large German-speaking minority (actually majority in parts),
and it is a result of the disintegration of the
multi-ethnic, multicultural, multilingual Austro-Hungarian
Empire.

The area is split between different Italian provinces, a
case of [divide et
impera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule). I
won't normally report the exact province we are in.

We'll drive along to get a feeling for landscape, and a
means is, to "make" as many mountain passes as possible
:grin:
