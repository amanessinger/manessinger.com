Another black and white image. I guess I did it, because I
already was at it.

It's funny, because if they had called it "Permanent Make-Up
& More", the shop's name would be completely in English.
This happens a lot. Most immigrants know English better than
German, especially in the beginning, and these kinds of
shops are frequently opened by immigrants.
