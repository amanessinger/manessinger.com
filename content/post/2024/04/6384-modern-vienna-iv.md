Here's the last black and white image for a while. I wanted
at least some drama in the sky, and that was much easier to
achieve in black and white than in color.

I wanted to contrast the modern building with the old
lantern. By the way, here's where the smaller sensor of
Micro Four Thirds helps tremendously. The lantern is on the
center-side of Donaukanal, the modern building is on the far
side. I'm standing much closer to the lantern than to the
building, and I probably should have used f10 in hindsight,
but even at f8, I got the lantern in acceptable focus.
