Romeno is a small town along the road. I wouldn't have
included this image, if it were not the first on my blog
where I've removed something with Lightroom's new generative
AI.

Is it good? Well, it works. It produces acceptable results,
arguably much better than the context-sensitive fill before,
but it does not match the resolution of the image. It's good
for small patches, and you can help it along by painting
some noise over the patch to fake more detail. Here I've
removed two small but obnoxious blue and white signs marring
the two church towers, and two more signs in between, part
of a parking car on the right side and a car and a tractor
at the end of the street.

I won't do that regularly, but this was a good image to try
generative AI. The result is really ok, no cats were hurt
and apart from the signs, there are days you can see the
street like this. Just not when I was there.

It's a fine line. We'll discuss the ethics and a possible
framework soon.
