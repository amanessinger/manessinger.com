My pictures were taken in September 2020, almost four years
ago. When I [look at the house in
streetview](https://www.google.at/maps/@46.4184345,11.2043448,3a,60y,245.85h,115.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s56fbaKbFILHLAjBUgb65DA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu),
I currently see the state in September 2023 with scaffolding
all over the facade. I'm afraid though, it will end up as
another apartment building, and I'll never sip wine there
:grin:
