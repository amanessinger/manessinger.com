What you see here is a look into Trentino, one of the
provinces that South Tyrol was partitioned into. It's named
after Trento/Trient, the place where the famous [Council of
Trent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Trent) was
held between 1545 and 1563. Trento was our target.

Trentino is one of the big Apple producers in Europe. Down
in the valley, those big patches, these are shading nets
protecting the apples. In fact there are apples everywhere
and not everything is shaded, but either they move the nets
or they grow different sorts of apples. Actually I saw only
Green and Red Delicious. Maybe one of them needs the shades.
