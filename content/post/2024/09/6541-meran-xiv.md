This is ISO 200, 0.6s, taken with the non-stablized
7-14/2.8. In-body stabilization did its thing, but the
result is much worse than that at 1.0s of the stabilized
12-100/4 in the image yesterday. 

In short, today I won't do these things anymore. It's
stupid. I've completely stopped worrying about ISO. Today, I
set the camera to a maximum exposure time of 1/10s, auto ISO
to a maximum of 12800, and if an image comes out noisy at
ISO 8000, DxO fixes the image perfectly.

I've stared doing so in April 2023 in Rome. It will take us
a while until we get there. On the blog, we are still in 2020.
