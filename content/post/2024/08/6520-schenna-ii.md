Looking south-west now, we see Meran/Merano in the valley
below. That's our next target, but first Schenna, the
beautiful resting place of Archduke Johann of Austria.
We're here for his mausoleum.

If you think this image and the previous have unnatural
colors, you're right, they have. It's what you get when
trying to rescue long distance images with lots of haze in
them. Nothing to be proud of, but, you know, you might never
return.
