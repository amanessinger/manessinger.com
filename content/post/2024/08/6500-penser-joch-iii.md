[I've used to celebrate the
500s](/2008/02/500-half-of-it-dearie.html), but not so much
now :smile:

Oh, funny, on that linked post I had 13 comments. The
indicator is still there, but the comments are not
displayed. 

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), my static site generator, the
only one that can build 6500 posts and all the link pages in
12 seconds, has recently deprecated the function I use to
read the comment files. I had switched to the recommended
replacement, but obviously, as the euphemism goes, mistakes
were made :stuck_out_tongue:
