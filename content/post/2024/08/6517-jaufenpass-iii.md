An advantage of the weather was, that fewer motorcycles and
bicycles were on the road. All those mountain passes in
South Tyrol are a paradise for motorbikes - and you hear it.
Bicycles, on the other hand, frequently come in big groups,
slowing you down on the narrow, curvy roads. And of course
you hear similar things about cars and each other from both
sorts of bikers :grin:
