Pretty extreme, huh? Why do I do that? Well, of course you
can't possibly see this picture. Your eyes are not built for
that. But does this mean the image is useless as a memory?

It's not. I was there. I have looked around. I have seen all
that, just serially, and all that has found its way into my
memory. My eyes are not built to catch the whole scene, but
my memory is built to hold it.

In other words: I know the proportions are wrong, but they
don't feel like it. Looking at the picture, again I scan its
regions, again I see the parts. It's much less different
from being there than one would think.
