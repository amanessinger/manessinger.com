This largely failed attempt to capture the whole structure
is a panorama of two or three images, stitched in Lightroom
and then manually massaged in Photoshop. I know it's not
accurate, but I don't know how close or far I got. On that
perch, you can't stand in a position where you could take
that image. Never mind, just google "schenna mausoleum" and
change to the image tab. There are a few images taken by
drones or from nearby hills.
