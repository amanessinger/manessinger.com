Austria always was a catholic country. The Habsburg dynasty
would rather risk self-destruction of its Holy Roman Empire
during a bloody 30 years war, than allow people to choose
their religion. Vienna was their capital, and it is full of
and surrounded by monasteries. Klosterneuburg is one of
them.
