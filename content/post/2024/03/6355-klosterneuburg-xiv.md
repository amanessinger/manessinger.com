A chapel near the entrance. I had to be quick to get the
shot. The lighting was ... problematic. Still, shooting RAW,
I could achieve a satisfying white balance. Well, rather
white balances, I should say, because I had to treat the
upper part different from the rest. As most of the time in
such situations, blue is the signal color to get right.
