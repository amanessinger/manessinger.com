In the 18<sup>th</sup> century a complete rebuild to a
monastery/imperial residence, similar to Spain's Escorial
was started, but only one of the planned four courts was
ever finished. Still, it's pretty impressive for an
unfinished building.

By the way, unfinished imperial buildings are one of
Austria's specialties. Same with Vienna's Saint Stephen's
(lacking the second tower) and indeed Hofburg, the Imperial
Palace in Vienna.
