The first image from two days ago, pointed straight towards
the altar, had been taken at f8, ISO&nbsp;200 and
2.5&nbsp;s. I had needed different color corrections in
different sections of the image. The contrast between the
light through the plain windows behind the altar, and the
back of the church, lit from one side through this blue and
golden window, couldn't have been more brutal.

DXO DeepPRIME XD had saved the shadows in the first image.
The image of today would have been impossible without DXO.

The original was mostly black, except the window and a few
streaks of color, where the light is reflected on the
benches. It was a single exposure. Normally I would have
taken a bracketed series of five images, but here I failed
to do so, probably because to my eyes the contrast was
strong but not extreme.

I've tried Lightroom, and the result was really poor. I
tried an earlier version of DxO DeepPrime, and it was
better, but still unsatisfying. This one is nice. I think,
this is the best you can get without an HDR output device -
and [I've already talked about the problems of
that](/2023/11/6232-rosenburg-xxvi.html).
