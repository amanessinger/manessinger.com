This is the only image taken in Schlosshof using the
ultra-wide at 7&nbsp;mm. For Micro Four Thirds, this is a
pretty big and heavy lens. Given how rarely I use it, you
could question the value of lugging it around, but then, if
you need it, you need it, and be it for a single image
:grin:

By the way, welcome to 2024. Hopefully it will be a more
peaceful year. You can always hope, can you?
