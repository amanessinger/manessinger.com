There were some images that probably would have been more spectacular, but for its simplicity and geometric quality  I like this one a lot. <br/><br/>This is a new hotel, right opposite of where I work. While going for lunch I noticed the reflections on the facade, together with the already visible signs of weather. There was not much choice about composition, because to both sides there were traffic signs, but actually I like the juxtaposition of the group and the loner.<br/><br/>I have pushed contrast and color a little bit in Photoshop, but not too excessive.
