After these about 30 minutes I was confident to have at least two or three good candidates, all of them in vivid colors.<br/><br/>I was wrong. In the evening, on my way home, I came by Gutenberggasse in Vienna's 7<sup>th</sup> district. On the corner there was an open garbage can, one of the sort that are mounted on lamp posts. Normally they have a cover on top with only a small opening, but this one had the lid raised. I don't know why, but somehow this attracted me, maybe because it looked different in a way. I put the camera on the garbage can, set the Sigma 10-20/4-5.6 to 10mm/f.8, held my breath and clicked. It took two exposures to get a sharp one.<br/><br/>According to the terminology of yesterday, this is again a (3), a weird perspective. What makes the image for me are the curves of the garbage can and its lid.
