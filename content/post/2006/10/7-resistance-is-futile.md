Otoh, for photography this is a feast. I have shot the image today, already in Carinthia, Villach to be precise, on an overcast day. Isn't this dark ruby red spectacular? There are some others as well, but this one made it for the ondulating lines of the leaves.<br/><br/>Oh, and, when I finally drove home at about 18:00 I found myself in the most horrible situation: Being on a motorway, driving along at 130 km/h, suddenly the clouds broke up and there was the most spectacular sundown I have seen in months. Bad luck, I'd say ðŸ™‚
