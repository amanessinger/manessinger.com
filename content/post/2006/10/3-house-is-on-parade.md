I couldn't find anything suitable today, thus I had to resort to the archives. This house entrance was so vivid in color that it reminded me of flags and parade uniforms.<br/><br/>Hmm ... so far I really seem to fancy the color red ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>A week ago I finished Bryan Peterson's book "Learning To See Creatively". A wonderful book about photography from a man who seems to value nothing higher than rich, vivid colors. Well worth a read, because it made me hunt for colors like I never had done before.
