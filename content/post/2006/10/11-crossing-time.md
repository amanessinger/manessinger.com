Normally this does not prevent me from taking photographs, though it probably makes finding motives a bit harder. Not so today. I had no time at all, thus here we go with one from the archives. This is a door in Seidengasse, in Vienna's 7<sup>th</sup> district, that's where I live.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is a perfect match for today's overall feeling. I have taken the image on October, 5<sup>th</sup>. I used the Sigma 30/1.4 wide open. I really love this lens as it is a "standard lens" on the D200, and it forces me to try harder on composition. Many of the images I take with this lens have somewhat strange angles and strong lines that frequently originate in corners. Actually the style I have at the moment in general, even with the Nikon 18-200 zoom, is strongly influenced by my working style with this lens. The images of the day numbers 8 and 10 are good examples.<br/><br/>What fascinates me in this image is the combination of Art DÃ©co ornaments and Christian connotation. In fact it looks like a cross looming large above me, but at the same time, with the face at the center, it has a strangely heathen aspect. Along with the angle this makes for a disturbing quality.
