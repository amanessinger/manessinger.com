I am completely ignorant. I can't tell you what kind of seeds they are, but for sure they are in a most unlikely place. They look arranged, but who's done it? A child? Probably, as this is near a playground in Vienna.<br/><br/>At first I didn't even see them. It took the attentive eye of my companion who pointed them out. I have made two attempts, the first one focusing on the second seed from the front, but this one was better. It is not the seeds though, that make the image, it is the curve.
