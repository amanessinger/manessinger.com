I got up at 4:30 in the morning with the intent of driving up Dobratsch, a mountain in Carinthia near Villach. I got there much too late, civil twilight was almost over, and I had only about 5 minutes of shooting before the sun came up. I was quite lucky though, because the sun soon vanished in semi-transparent clouds. That kept the overall atmosphere and gave me much more time.<br/><br/>In this image I have zoomed halfway in to the left of the sun for the amazing layers of fog pierced by rays of light, the valley being all foam.
