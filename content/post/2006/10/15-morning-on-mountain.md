Being there and watching the sun rise gets quite addictive. I had a morning and an evening session, the morning with a wonderful sunrise and the evening with a mediocre sundown. Let's talk about the morning.<br/><br/>This image was shot after the immediate stress of sunrise, of not wanting to miss one magic moment, was over and I had time to experiment with the warm light of the new day on some very old wood.<br/><br/>Compositionally the small dark tree plays the role of counterpoint to the big chunk of wood to the left. It struggles to do so and in hindsight I wish it was a tad more dominant.
