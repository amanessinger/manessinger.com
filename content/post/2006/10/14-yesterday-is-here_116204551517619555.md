I had a busy day yesterday and simply forgot posting the IOTD. Lazy me, this means two for today, here comes the first one. <br/><br/>This is WÃ¶rthersee in Carinthia, probably our most beautiful lake, as seen from the tower atop Pyramidenkogel (which means "pyramid hill", named for its form). I was there for sundown, but they close the tower only 5 minutes into civil twilight. I guess it is not administered by a photographer. Never mind, sundown was disappointing anyway.<br/><br/>The most important fact about this image is, that it was shot with my new Sigma 10-20/4-5.6. I had pondered quite a while about buying an ultra-wide lens and was always undecided between the Tokina 12-24/4 and the Nikon 12-24/4. Well, to be honest, the main points for the Sigma were that it was available right at the shop which the Tokina was not, and that it is incredibly affordable which the Nikon is not. Finally its range perfectly complements my Nikon 18-200 which both others don't, and it is the widest of all. Quality is nothing to complain about. Is is sturdily built, very sharp, at least beyond f8 (I have not tried anything else yet, but why should I use such a lens below???), has next to no CA, even in the corners at 10mm, in other words: this is a bargain and I am very satisfied ðŸ™‚
