I still wanted an image, thus I drove to Sternberg, a small church on top of basically a big rock. It has an awesome view and at this time of the year you can even see a sundown from there. Not that there would have been anything mentionable about the sundown, as the sky was featureless blue. Maybe I'll show some sundown images this winter, though I doubt that the road is usable throughout winter.<br/><br/>After some tinkering around with color versions, I decided to present the image in B&W, as this seems to give better balance.
