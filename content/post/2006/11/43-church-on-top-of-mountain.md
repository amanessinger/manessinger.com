Enough to keep it out of the fog in all but the most severe cases, accessible via a good street throughout the year. 2000 years ago the Romans were there, and they came only after the Celts. Today there is an archeological park near the top and opposite of the church is an inn, open all of the year as well.<br/><br/>Yesterday (yes, I'm a tad late with this entry) I was there with my father to shoot the sundown. I did, it was quite spectacular, but then I can't always post sundowns, can I?
