On the other hand I needed an image of the day. Normally this is a good reason to mount the Nikon 18-200 and go for some macro shooting. The 18-200 is not the first choice for macro, but as long as I don't have the new Nikon 105/2.8 VR this is my best tool for the job.<br/><br/>Today though I didn't even feel like changing lenses ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>I kept the Sigma 10-20 and went through the garden and around the house, looking for interesting geometry. Soon enough I found some tomatoes at the edge of the terrace and had all: geometry and color. It took me some exposures to come up with anything usable, because for the perspective I wanted to use a focal length of 10mm, but on the other hand that made compositing not exactly easy.<br/><br/>The final image is not exactly the composition I wanted, it's the result of a crop, but I am still satisfied.
