Thanks, guys.<br/><br/>The image is from yesterday evening. Today, Friday, is my travel day and you can hardly expect a good image from me on Fridays. <br/><br/>Anyway. I came by this motorcycle while on my way home. I had taken a somewhat unusual route, and there it was in all its beauty. I had the Nikon 18-200 on the camera and didn't want to change, so I made one lame exposure and  went along. Seeing the image at home on screen made me weep - regardless of the cold I had to go out again, this time with the Sigma 10-20. I shot a series of about 10 images and went home, only to find out that I was an idiot: I had forgotten to remove a green plastic bottle under the front tyre, that ruined almost every shot. Thus I went out again. This image is from that third series.
