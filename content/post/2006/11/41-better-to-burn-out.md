In my wide-angle frenzy and the recent Lensbaby-mania it has seemed unattractive, lackluster. Well, I could not have been more wrong. Funnily enough, once you're gone, you can always come back ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Basically there is no other lens that challenges and inspires me so much. Let's be honest: It's so incredibly easy to please with the ultra-wide, it's so incredible easy to evade every challenge with the Nikon 18-200 VR, and the Lensbaby has a tendency to go for the cheap effect anyway. Don't get me wrong, I love all these lenses, but ...

 The first few minutes after mounting the 30/1.4 I always feel restricted, uncomfortable, likely to miss all opportunities, and then, suddenly, I begin not only to see, I begin to create. And that's what photography is all about, isn't it?<br/><br/>Rock and roll is here to stay!

<strong>EDIT:</strong> This was the first post on my blog, that contained a song reference, something that later became a regular feature, the Song of the Day. Originally this post contained only the oblique references, so let's make it clear:

The Song of the Day is "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/n/neil_young/hey_hey_my_my.html">Hey Hey My My (Into The Black)</a>" from the 1979 Neil Young classic "Rust Never Sleeps". See a fantastic performance on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA-DjpLitCA">YouTube</a>.
