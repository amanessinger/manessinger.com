I was so tired, I simply couldn't. Therefore you get two images today, this one actually being from yesterday. <br/><br/>I got this fish for my birthday years ago from a good friend, and it is at work on my desk since. I guess it likes my new lensbaby. At the moment I experiment with this amazing little toy (the lensbaby, not the fish) wide open, as it makes for the most effect. I have no final verdict yet, but one thing's for sure: it is not meant for scenic landscape ðŸ˜„
