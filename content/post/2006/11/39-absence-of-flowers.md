Today I got the macro kit, a set of two near lenses, one with 4 diopters, one with 10. They can also be combined. The minimum focusing distance using the combo is between 5 and 8cm. One more toy ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Ideally I would have tried it with a flower, but having none at home I had to resort to  a candle holder, basically a small cup of glass.
