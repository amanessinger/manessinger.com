Anyway, at 15:30 I took the car to get me some images. A short glance at the sky made clear that there was the potential for a rather spectacular sundown. <br/><br/>At that time I had two choices: Magdalensberg, a free-standing mountain near Klagenfurt with a view from north-east to north-west, and again the lake. I was not sure if I could make it for Magdalensberg, thus I chose the lake.<br/><br/>Sundown was not quite as spectacular as I had expected, but with some foreground of the pier it was good enough to bother you with another Image of the Day ðŸ™‚
