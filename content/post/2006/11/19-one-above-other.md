In the meantime you may know my fancy for weird angles, but this image was taken the way it was taken out of necessity. <br/><br/>This is a medieval cult room of the Order of the Templars. It lies below the courtyard of a castle and receives light through an opening in the ceiling. Directly below is a small pool collecting rain. The room is dark and has an apsis with an altar at its rear. <br/><br/>The atmosphere of the room cannot be properly acknowledged without seeing lighthole, pool and altar all at once. It took 10mm, a weird angle and Photoshop trickery and deceit to get the ingredients into the picture and properly distribute the tones.
