<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061124_094148_bw.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2006/20061124_094148_bw.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>I shot this image yesterday morning purely by chance. I did not recognize it for what it is. That alone would not have been a problem, but it was not even sharp. Yesterday noon I tried it again, the light was too harsh and there were some harsh shadows. Impossible, thus I came back this morning, found the same light, shot eight exposures and then I had it.<br/><br/>This was shot with the Sigma 30/1.4, of course. I don't do these things with any other lens. At least not that regularly ðŸ™‚
