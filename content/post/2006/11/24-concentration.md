I had considered choosing an image from the archives, but, in reality, that's not what this blog is all about, and I really do it only if there is no other choice. Quite uninspired I made some experiments  and suddenly there was this: a globe of light dancing on a pattern of concentric rings, altogether vaguely reminding me of Saturn.<br/><br/>Or is it a spiral? Hey, it is, otherwise the parts of my kitchen lamp would immediately  crush to the ground, wouldn't they?
