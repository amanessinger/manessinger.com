The sculpture in the foreground may be something by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, as it looks startlingly like his architecture.<br/><br/>It's been quite a while that I needed so much time to prepare a photo in Photoshop. I had two (and maybe half) candidates for the IOTD. I decided to use this one, mostly because it was technically challenging. At first I tried to go for color, finally I settled with high-contrast B&amp;W. The challenge was to come up with high contrast and rich tonality, keeping noise low and being true to the original atmosphere as I remember it.
