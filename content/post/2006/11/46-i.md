Mount a fast lens on your camera, the camera on the tripod, and shoot a series of self-portraits, of course ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing how many exposures you need to get anything decent. Anyway, as far as I can say now, I'm back at work tomorrow, thus I won't bother you with myself any more.
