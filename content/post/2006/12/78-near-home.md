When I could, it was too late to get to any of the fancier places, thus I kept near home.<br/><br/>This is little more than 1 kilometer from where I live. I came back from a session just out of the fog, at the edge of a forest, and when I drove back, I got to this place, just in the transition zone. This is, of course, the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm.
