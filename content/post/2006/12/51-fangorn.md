In the early afternoon I took the car and drove west, towards Villach. The fog vanished after only a couple of kilometers, though I was told that at home it stayed all day.<br/><br/>My target was <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=13&ll=46.693784,13.912768&spn=0.112562,0.21183&om=1" target="_blank">Gerlitzen</a>, a mountain north-east of Villach. I took the western road from Treffen, because that's nearest the highway. After about one hour I was on the parking site at Kanzelhöhe, 1524m above sea level and in glorious sunshine. From there I went almost all the way up to the summit and finally turned back at about 1900m when the sun set.<br/><br/>I spare you the sundown images. They are not too bad, but we already had a couple of that. I took this image on the road from Treffen up to Kanzelhöhe, maybe at about 900 or 1000m. I was not sure if I could capture the magical atmosphere and actually am quite satisfied with the result. I used the Nikon 18-200 at 65mm (97mm equiv.), f8, 1/30s, ISO 125.<br/><br/>Btw, this is the first time I used links to <a href="http://maps.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>, and that's something I'll do on a regular basis from now on. My home in Carinthia, for instance, is in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=13&ll=46.540207,14.120607&spn=0.112881,0.21183&om=1" target="_blank">Franzendorf</a>, which is a part of Ludmannsdorf.
