It is incredibly quiet here between Christmas and New Year. I can't say that I had much time for photographing, but at least I got inspiration for two shots I'll try to repeat tomorrow. One desperately needs a polarizer, which I didn't recognize in my hurry, and the other needs slightly different framing, but both seem repeatable.<br/><br/>Anyway. It's always a little harder to come up with usable images in Vienna. I have much less time and mostly rely on isolating details. My best tools in that struggle are the Lensbaby and the Sigma 30/1.4, both wide open. In this case we are back to the Sigma.<br/><br/>This is part of a fence guarding a sapling in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=17&ll=48.200236,16.345285&spn=0.006951,0.013239&om=1" target="_blank">Seidengasse</a>, right between Zieglergasse and Bandgasse.
