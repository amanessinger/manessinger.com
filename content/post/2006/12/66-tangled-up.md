I, for instance, have pondered for months about a macro lens and had already decided to buy the new Nikon 105 VR. It seemed the obvious choice, at least, yes, at least until over at <a href="http://www.slrgear.com/" target="_blank">slrgear.com</a> I read an absolutely enthusiastic review of the <a href="http://www.slrgear.com/reviews/showproduct.php/product/180/cat/30" target="_blank">Sigma 150mm f/2.8 EX DG HSM APO Macro</a>. What an impressive name ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>Not only is this lens said to be excellent, no, it is even about a third cheaper than the Nikon, and, honestly, when I was asked last week in the <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/">Radiant Vista</a> forum if I have an idea why someone should need VR when shooting macro, I was not really sure what to answer.<br/><br/>The advantage of the Sigma over the Nikon is, that you have more flexibility in your working range. The disadvantage is clear as well: at 895g the Sigma is quite a heavy-weight. No problem, I'm a strong man ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>So you may ask yourself, what's the point of all this? Simple: I've made my decision, today I have bought the Sigma. I can't say anything decisive about its quality yet, but you can expect me to begin posting one or the other macro shot soon.<br/><br/>As regards this image, well, this is obviously the Lensbaby in action. When at noon I went to my photo dealer to buy Capture NX and a 77mm polarizer (yes, it's been an expensive day), I found this bicycle on <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&amp;z=16&ll=48.203583,16.355252&amp;spn=0.013186,0.016136" target="_blank">Spittelberg</a> (you remember, the mountain in Vienna that's no mountain at all), leaning against a fence, entangled in some shrub, almost becoming part of it in a very organic way.
