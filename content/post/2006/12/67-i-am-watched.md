An excuse? Maybe, because on my way home I bought two daylight lamps and an orchid. At home I assembled the lamps and mounted them to both sides of the kitchen table, put the orchid in between, freshly sprayed with a mist of water, arranged lighting, put the camera with the new Sigma 150 macro on the tripod and shot away. <br/><br/>Many shots.<br/><br/>I won't show them here. I have to learn. I have to look around on the web for good macro shots, what makes them, what breaks them. Muku Muku strongly agrees.
