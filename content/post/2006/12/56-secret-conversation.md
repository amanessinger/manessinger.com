Sorry, I could not make up my mind. Yesterday I had quite a variety of mediocre images and some good ones, this one probably the best. I drove to Klagenfurt for some night images, finding myself quite disgusted by the Christmas decoration and all the traffic, but there are some quiet spots, even in these busy times.<br/><br/>One of those places is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=46.621825,14.308813&spn=0.00658,0.007467" target="_blank">half-open yard</a> at the Dome, facing Lidmannskygasse. Here I found this secret conversation between the Holy Hemma of Gurk and an angel.
