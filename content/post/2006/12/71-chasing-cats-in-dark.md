<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061223_165722.JPG"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2006/20061223_165722.JPG"/></a><br/><br/>Today was the first time that I drove up "<a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=13&amp;ll=46.603813,13.661156&amp;spn=0.105319,0.119476" target="_blank">Dobratsch</a>" in the afternoon for a sundown shooting. Being my sunrise mountain and at the parking area facing east, it is not a logical candidate, but I had business nearby in Villach anyway. I figured there would be some hill easily reachable from the parking area that gets at least late sun, and so it was.<br/><br/>I shot quite a number of nice images with the Sigma 10-20, and when I went back to the car it was already quite dark as a snowcat passed me by. I grabbed the camera, but it on the tripod, sort of composed, and instead of getting the light trail that I had hoped for, I was only able to catch the image you see here, with the snowcat all but gone. When I finally saw the image, I realized that it was entirely different from what I had intended, but had its own charme. The image is  the unmodified JPEG that came out of the camera.
