The weather report stated, that the fog would clear up in all of Carinthia by early afternoon, and so it was. All could have been so well.<br/><br/>When I came back home at noon, I wanted to stow everything away, and as I went into the cellar to put a frozen cake into the freezer, I had the certain feeling that something was wrong. Things inside the freezer should have been frozen, but they were not. The chicken were soft as - chicken. The freezer was disconnected from the mains!<br/><br/>Thinking about when this could have happened, I suddenly remembered when last week I had a problem activating the dryer. No wonder, because it was not connected. Therefore I disconnected the old freezer that was switched off anyway ... or so I thought. In reality I had instead disconnected the new freezer.<br/><br/>This had been five or six days past. I was quite sure that there was not much to do but throwing everything away, but to verify that I called a laboratory in Klagenfurt that specializes in food analysis. They confirmed my suspicion: I have to throw away 20 or 30 kg of meat, some pizzas, vegetables, herbs and what else.<br/><br/>At that time I was so fed up and time had progressed so much, that I saw no chance for the trip I had planned for the afternoon, a trip to at least two, maybe three waterfalls in the mountains.<br/><br/>This image is one of a series I took in the early afternoon, images from the mountains on the other side of the valley. The waterfalls can wait for tomorrow.
