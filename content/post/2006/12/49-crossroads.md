That's a whole order of magnitude and not at all shabby. The effect was, that I had no time left for photographing, even more problematic, because today was this week's first sunny day.<br/><br/>When I arrived in Carinthia, at Klagenfurt's main station, I had to wait two or three minutes, and in that time I made two shots at the parking site of the station's super market. The first was rubbish, the second, the only survivor, is this image. Due to the cars there was not much choice regarding composition, but I am quite satisfied anyway.
