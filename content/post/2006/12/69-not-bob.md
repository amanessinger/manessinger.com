It's 3:29 in the morning and finally I get to posting my Image of the Day. <br/><br/>Anyway. Originally I intended to post another door, shot with the Lensbaby, and to call it "... said the Joker to the Thief", just to connect it to yesterday, but at about 1:30 in the morning I decided to give the Sigma 150 macro another try. After all this is about photography, not Bob.<br/><br/>From my first ventures into macro photography I had not only the orchid brought along but also three small pumpkins, one gloriously molding in pure white and blueish green. I set things up on the kitchen table, used a daylight lamp for lighting and made about 20 shots of which 9 survived. I finally selected this one for its simplicity.
