<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061225_165706_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2006/20061225_165706_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This is from yesterday's afternoon session. I was out in the vicinity for some foggy landscapes. On my way home I found this wonderfully lit tree, about halfway between <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=14&ll=46.607882,14.051514&spn=0.052655,0.059738" target="_blank">Velden and Augsdorf</a>. It was a bit awkward, because in order to avoid including the fence, I had to shoot slightly upward. With the ultra-wide this gave me the intended perspective on the tree, but the pieces of fence at the bottom were awkwardly distorted.<br/><br/>Using the vertical perspective slider in Photoshop's lens correction filter would cut away too much of the tree, thus what I did was a two-layer approach. First I did color correction and cloning away of some distracting details at the edges. Then I duplicated this layer and ran the lens correction filter on the duplicate. With a mask I restricted the corrected image to the bottom part. Luckily the image lends itself easily to such manipulations. I really like the result.<br/><br/>The other new thing (and the reason for me posting yesterday's entry so late) is, that I have registered with the forum at <a href="http://lensbabies.com/" target="_blank">Lensbabies.com</a>. There is quite some traffic, but detailed critiques are scarce. I guess there is only one <a href="http://www.radiantvista.com/" target="_blank">Radiant Vista</a> after all. Anyway, at the Radiant Vista was no traffic and I thought, a change of perspective is always a good idea.
