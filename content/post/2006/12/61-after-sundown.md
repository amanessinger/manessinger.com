<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061213_165544_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2006/20061213_165544_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This is the same church as in "<a href="/2006/11/43-church-on-top-of-mountain.html" target="_blank">The Church on Top of the Mountain</a>", only this time after sundown and from the front. I shot the image on <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&amp;z=11&ll=46.727036,14.420929&amp;spn=0.420313,0.477905" target="_blank">Magdalensberg</a> , my "sundown mountain", about 10 kilometers north-east of Klagenfurt. It is a pretty safe bet when you want to escape the fog, and that was exactly what I needed today.<br/><br/>Remember the <a href="/2006/12/59-not-everything-is-frozen.html" target="_blank">not-so-frozen</a> meat? Well, today we had the pleasure to empty the freezer, sort its contents into meat, organic but not meat, and packaging. Afterwards I took the meat and drove it to Klagenfurt, where they have a refuse disposal service specialized on meat.<br/><br/>We'd had fog all day and by the time I was rid of the meat, Magdalensberg was really my only option. Traffic was a bitch (don't you love the scene in Robert Altman's "The Player", when Bruce Willis uses that phrase as an excuse why he is so late rescuing Julia Roberts?) and I didn't make it for any direct sunlight. The sun just vanished below the horizon when when I was maybe 50 meters below the summit.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough this incredibly drab, foggy day had been absolutely cloudless, thus the sundown was not spectacular at all. I made some pictures of the panorama, the animals up there and the church, this one already in very low light, 30 seconds at f16, of course with the Sigma 10-20 at 10mm.
