I was quite busy all day and had no time for photographing until I drove to Klagenfurt to visit my parents. I thought afterwards would be a good time to try out my new MC-36 shutter release cord. <br/><br/>About two weeks ago I had already tried to take certain shots at Klagenfurt's "<a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=17&ll=46.623166,14.300047&spn=0.00658,0.007467" target="_blank">Lendhafen</a>", the place where the channel "Lend" ends, this channel that leads from the lake into town. In earlier centuries the channel was used to transport goods into the town. Nowadays people skate there in winter, but that's about its only use. Two weeks ago I failed miserably, because 30 seconds were not enough.<br/><br/>This time I had all the equipment. I began with ISO 1600 and made a test exposure for 10 seconds. This was about OK for a moderate overexposure. Now I switched back to ISO 100 and exposed for 2 minutes and 40 seconds, and then again half that time, and again, all in all three exposures. Back home I combined the three exposures to an HDR image. That's what you see here.<br/><br/>Merry Christmas to you all, and peace to the world. We bitterly need it.
