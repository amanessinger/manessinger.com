I was almost late to work in the morning, I was not out shooting at noon, this means I have no Image of the Day. So far in these situations I have taken one from October, 10<sup>th</sup> (there are still some left), but this time we go back for only three days.<br/><br/>This image is from the same session as <a href="/2006/12/74-out-of-fog.html" target="_blank">74 - Out of the Fog</a>. It is a part of the so called "Red Cliff", in this case not so red, not at all.
