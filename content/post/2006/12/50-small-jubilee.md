I have slept long, found the day foggy - that's epidemic at this time of the year in Carinthia - and when I was ready to drive away, it was little more than an hour before sundown. I surrendered, and drove to town for shopping.<br/><br/>This image was shot at October, 10<sup>th</sup> in Vienna, in front of an Asian flower shop in Lerchenfelderstra√üe. It's from the same series as <a href="/2006/11/28-rising-flames.html">28 - Rising Flames</a>.
