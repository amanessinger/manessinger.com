<a href="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/1200x1200/2006/20061209_163638_ps.jpg"><img src="https://d25zfm9zpd7gm5.cloudfront.net/0600x0600/2006/20061209_163638_ps.jpg"/></a><br/><br/>This image was taken yesterday (I am a day late again, yes, I know) on <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=12&amp;ll=46.575855,13.658409&amp;spn=0.210746,0.238953" target="_blank">B111 </a> between NÃ¶tsch and the Highway A2, facing Dobratsch, the mountain where I at other times hunt sunrises.<br/><br/>It was a cold, rainy day and we visited a relative in Hermagor, quite a bit west of where I took the image. In the evening we had an invitation, thus I had almost no time for photographing. Not the best of images, but the best I could get.<br/><br/>On a side note, I returned from the invitation with a Sigma 170-500 that our friend Wolfgang gave me for a week. He has a considerable analog Nikon equipment, but since more than a year almost exclusively shoots digital, at the moment with a bridge cam.<br/><br/>Weather today is quite as gruesome as it was yesterday, but maybe I can take the 170-500 to use anyway. We'll see in the evening.
