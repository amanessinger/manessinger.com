In the evening I'll leave to Vienna, back to my usual routine of work there and weekends here. What a long time and how many images. I have never written a diary before and I do not know if this is a general effect that writing diaries has, but writing this blog gives me the strong feeling that time passes slower, lets itself be experienced more intensely.<br/><br/>Today the fog is so high that it does not make sense to search for sunshine, thus I've shot some fog images from our garden down the valley, and this will be it.
