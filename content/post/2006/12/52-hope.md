Sorry for not having posted earlier, I could not decide which one to take and grew soo tired over it ðŸ™‚<br/><br/>This image was taken on <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=13&amp;ll=46.586002,13.762264&amp;spn=0.112786,0.21183" target="_blank">Dobratsch</a> again, from that long street winding up, called Villacher AlpenstraÃŸe, looking south. Comparing with the map, you can fairly well recognize the area called "OberschÃ¼tt". The image was taken with the Sigma 10-20 and quite heavily post-processed in Photoshop to cope with the high contrast, keep some color and accentuate those delicate rays of light.<br/><br/>Originally I had intended to take a longer trip, but the weather seemed very unstable, and as it turned out, I really had had the best light in the beginning. Nevertheless quite satisfied I turned home at noon.
