The only flaw, that I could possible think of, is the obvious lack
of a swimming pool. 

Oh, and, where we stand now, that's not a theater, it's a massive
late 17th century exedra, dedicated to St. Francis Xavier, who
stayed at the former castle on the site in 1537.

Still, that would be a damn good place for a party :joy:
