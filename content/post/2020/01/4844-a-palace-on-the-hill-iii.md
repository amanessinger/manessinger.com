This is the only image, that I managed to take of the palace's
chapel, the tiny Oratorio di San Giorgio. A few seconds later a
grumpy guardian told me it was forbidden to take photos. Thankfully
he didn't ask me to delete this one :smiley:

Fact is, I'm happy to pay for a photo permit, but more often than
not there is no choice. It's not much of a problem in Italy though,
and almost none in Austria.
