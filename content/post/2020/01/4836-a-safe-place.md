This is one of those images where I've corrected geometry fully. In
fact, you can't possible take a picture straight at those windows.
You'd have to levitate.

In earlier days my default solution would have been to take the
picture in an extremely oblique angle and to even exaggerate the
distortion. I still do that at times, and I still think it's a valid
method, but I've since learned to like plain old symmetry as well.

None is better than the other, tomorrow my decision could be
different :smiley:
