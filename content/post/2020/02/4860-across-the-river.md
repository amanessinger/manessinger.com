Another day, another trip west. The flat plains west of Chioggia are
criss-crossed by rivulets and canals. Here's a railway bridge and,
yes, I know, one shouldn't do that :smiley:

Technically this is a merge of two exposures, one without car across
the tracks on the other side, one with car but with more foreground.
That's one more reason why I still use Photoshop occasionally.
