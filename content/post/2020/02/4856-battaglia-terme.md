Oh the power of Google! This is somewhere between Praglia and
Chioggia. After one and a half year I couldn't tell where. Was it a
village along the road or had we touched the outskirts of a small
town?

Today we have a few options to find out what in my youth would have
been hard to recover. One way is Google Maps. I could just have
looked for the most likely route, and at promising places I could
have dropped into Street View. I do that a lot, but in this case
there was an easier way.

You see the house to the right in the background. Well, I just
googled the telephone number on the sign. It was just barely
readable in 2:1 enlargement, but sure enough the shop was in
Battaglia Terme.
