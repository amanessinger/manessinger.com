Let's close Este with a panorama, taken from the hills a few
kilometers west of Este.

It's a little bit small here on the blog, but you can always look at
the big versions on my [Flickr
account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/). Normally it
is pretty synchronous with the blog, but sometimes you'll have to
wait a day or two. At the moment it's a day in advance. From Flickr
you can download up to the original sizes ... and it's all free
:smiley:
