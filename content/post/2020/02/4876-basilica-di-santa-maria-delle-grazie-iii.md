By the way, you may have seen discussions about Olympus' third
iteration of the OM-D E-M1. You read a lot of bad things about it,
normally culminating in an outraged "Nothing has changed!". Well,
yes, it already was an almost perfect camera :smiley:

It is also wrong. Yes, I had hoped for an updated electronic
viewfinder, although the current one is extremely good and fast.
Other than that, well, they've added a joystick for focus points
(that's fine), moved the menu button into a completely different
position (which is not fine if you use both cameras), have made
processing faster, the autofocus even more precise, etc.

For me the single most important point is, that they have improved
stabilization even beyond the already insane level. I like that and
I've ordered one. Might take two weeks.

As always I've ordered the big eyepiece (Olympus EP-13) and a black
Kalahari Kaama M leather wrist strap.
