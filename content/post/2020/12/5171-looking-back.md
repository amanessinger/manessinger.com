A look back at San Vigilio and into the light. I wonder how a
general availability of HDR monitors (and I mean higher than what's
currently sold under that name) will influence how we process this
kind of images. Currently we have no choice but distributing as much
detail as possible within the small dynamic range of today's
monitors.

As a thought experiment: even if we had high dynamic range monitors,
even if everybody had them, and even if we could process for such a
standard and expect to see viewers to see what we see, would we want
to see it that way? The blinding light? Would we want to stare into
the sun?

And if so, what would this mean to photos processed today?
