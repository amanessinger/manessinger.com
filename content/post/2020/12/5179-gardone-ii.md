All in all, Gardone is not an especially beautiful place. It's a
narrow strip between lake and hills, cut in two by the busy western
lake road. The Grand Hotel in the background looks rather old and a
little shabby from closer up. There is also a deserted former
minigolf ground about where this image was taken. Gardone has
seemingly had better times.
