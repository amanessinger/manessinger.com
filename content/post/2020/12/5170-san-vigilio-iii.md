> “There are three areas in the world: Africa, Asia, Europe; Europe
is the most beautiful in the world; Italy is the most beautiful in
Europe; Lombardy is the most beautiful in Italy; Garda is the most
beautiful in Lombardy; San Vigilio is the most beautiful in Garda.
Thus, San Vigilio is the most beautiful place in the whole world.” -
Agostino Brenzone, 1540

I've copied that from their [homepage](http://www.locanda-sanvigilio.it/?lang=en). Currently they can't be booked, no prices available, but if you browse their page, you'll certainly get an impression :smiley:
