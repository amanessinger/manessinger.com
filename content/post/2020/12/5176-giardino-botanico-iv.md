The border between the Italian provinces of Veneto and Lombardy runs
right through the lake. The western shore, where we are now, is in
Lombardy. This has not always bee so. Remember the words of Agostino Brenzone:

>"Lombardy is the most beautiful in Italy; Garda is the most
beautiful in Lombardy; San Vigilio is the most beautiful in Garda.
Thus, San Vigilio is the most beautiful place in the whole world.”

Today, San Vigilio, situated on the eastern shore, is in Veneto.
Times change, so do borders, and if things go well, like they did in
Italy, borders become meaningless over time.
