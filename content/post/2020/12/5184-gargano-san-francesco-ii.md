The statue on this altar is brightly lit, everything else much less
so. I've exposed for the highlights, thus much of the picture was in
deep shadow. Did it hurt the image, that I raised the shadows?
Yes, there is some fine-grained noise in the dark parts, but
honestly, I didn't even have to use DxO's superior noise reduction.
Today's cameras are incredible devices.
