You know that a river runs through a city (as opposed to
tangentially touching it), when you constantly cross it, as a
tourist or in daily life.

I don't do that in Vienna. Yes, I cross the Danube by Underground
(even on a bridge actually), when I need to go to the center or to
the railway station, but that's not what I mean. In Budapest the
river equally divides the center. The density of bridges is high,
and you need to use them all the time. So I did.
