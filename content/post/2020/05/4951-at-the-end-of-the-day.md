I'm angry. So much dangerous stupidity out there, so many people
trying to actively sabotage everything that could possibly help ease
the situation.

Wear your mask, install the damn app, try for once not to live out
your individuality by behaving anti-social. Is that so hard? I
generally refuse to quote Trump, but: it will go away.

It will go away easier, if you cooperate. It will go away painfully,
if you don't. But even then: it will go away. So why not just shut
up and do your duty?
