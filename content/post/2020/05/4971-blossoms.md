It's now pretty exactly two years since I was in Budapest. In the
meantime we're in the midst of a pandemic. I won't complain, things
are fine here in Austria. It pays to have a government that actually
does its job. 

Mild distancing and masks in shops, that all which is left for now.
Not totally safe, but well under control. Travel restrictions still
apply. Let's see where I can get this year.

Not that I run out of pictures, but my new camera is slightly
under-utilized and I fear I'll have a lot of boring pictures to
show, a year from now :smiley:
