That's Saint Gell√©rt's view. The bridge is quite modern, I suppose
it had to be replaced after WWII. As a fact, all of Budapest's
bridges have been razed by the Germans, in order to slow the Red
Army's progress. Budapest may just have run out of the money needed
to restore it in its original style.
