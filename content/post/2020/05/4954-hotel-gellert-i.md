The Gellért is not the most expensive or the most luxurious hotel in
Budapest, but it is attached to a big thermal spa. Part of it is
indoors, part outdoors. The sauna is nothing to write home about,
because Hungary does not seem to have a sauna culture. On the other
hand, two of the indoor pools have a temperature of 38 degrees
Celsius. You can't stay in them for too long, but for a short time
it's heaven :smiley:

In essence, it is slightly overpriced for the hotel itself, but
combined with the spa, it is one of the best places to stay in
Budapest.
