Our beloved
[Empress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria),
Hungary's queen, murdered in Geneva by an anarchist. Here at the
Buda shore, near the bridge named after her, we find her monument.
She might have been slightly less sweet than portrayed in our 1955
movie [Sissi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissi_(film)).
