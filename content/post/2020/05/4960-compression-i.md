My first lens for the Nikon D200 was the 18-200/3.5-5.6 VR (28-300
eq.), a stabilized so-called travel zoom, and it was really decent
for its time. The Olympus 12-100/4.0 (24-200 eq.) is wider, shorter,
insanely better stabilized and very much sharper. In fact, it rivals
all primes I've ever had. Wide open. It's a marvel of a lens.
