I'd say the architecture of Budapest's Marriott definitely qualifies
as
[Brutalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture).
It was originally built in 1969 as the [Duna InterContinental
Hotel](https://www.nealprincetrust.org/id670.html).

I like that kind of architecture. It's amazing how much more courage
architects had in the 20 years after World War II, compared to now.
Just look at all those luxurious skyscrapers, that have been built
in Manhattan in recent years. They look all the same. Flat glass,
thin, as high as possible. Compared to that, these old, brutalist
buildings are each a unique landscape by itself.
