Things in Europe are rapidly improving. Borders to Germany, Slovenia
and Croatia are open now. At the moment you still need a corona test
not older than four days, or a two-weeks quarantine upon return, but
this is likely only a matter of days. I expect the Czech Republic
and Slovakia to follow soon. Hungary ... who knows. Italy will
likely be out of reach this year. Which is a shame.
