Tagging. My friend [Ted Byrne](https://imagefiction.blogspot.com/)
hates it. Hmm ... guess I'd hate it as well, if it were my house
:smiley:

Actually I don't understand the impulse to do it. It's not artistic,
it's repetitive, and I suppose it can get pretty expensive. Even
worse, once they get you for one, all the others, where you got
away, are instantly attributable to you. Sounds like a pretty stupid
way to risk your future - for nothing. But then, what do I know?
