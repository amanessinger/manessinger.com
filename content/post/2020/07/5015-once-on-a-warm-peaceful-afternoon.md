Carinthia. Land of mountains, lakes and pastures. This place is on a
hill between Klagenfurt, my hometown, and Sankt Veit, Carinthia's
capital of old. Far in the background, on a freestanding rock,
Castle Hochosterwitz, a spectacular medieval fortress. 

You can't really see Hochosterwitz at this size, you'll have to see
it on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/amanessinger/). Did you
know, that all of my images since 2011 are on Flickr? Not from the
start, but for most of that time, I have uploaded full sizes. They
are available for download - for free under <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. After all, this is a hobby, not a
business :smiley:
