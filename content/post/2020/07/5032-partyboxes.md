OK, it's a sex shop, but wtf are "partyboxes"??? 

I guess I've grown old :smiley:

By the way, I wanted to write "what the fuck", but my IntelliJ IDEA
integrated development environment berated me that "fuck" is
considered offensive. It also gave be the option to add an exception
for "fuck", an offer that I gladly accepted :grin:
