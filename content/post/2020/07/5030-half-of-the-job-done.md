The sticker on this post was popular during our previous government.
The two guys are our former and current Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, a
slick politician with undoubtedly the qualities of a man of action.
He led us through the Corona crisis. Actually I'm grateful for that.
Still, he is a master of intrigue and a habitual liar. His party has
been part of governments for more than 30 years. They are corrupt,
arrogant and believe to have a god-given right to govern.

The other one is H.C. Strache, who committed political suicide on
the party island of Ibiza. One more to go.
