Sometimes light situations are almost impossible to represent. Here
we have extremely low summer evening light. The camera's automatic
white balance was way too warm, the image looked like an old color
negative - for those of us, who still remember :smiley:

Is this true to reality? Nope. Apart from the tricky question what
reality is, one thing is for sure, computer monitors of today are
deeply inadequate. One has to choose, and my choice was for an
extremely cool temperature. Everything is still more or less orange,
but at least there are hints of original colors.
