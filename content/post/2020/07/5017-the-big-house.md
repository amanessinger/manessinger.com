Modern housing is available to a large part of the population today.
Well, at least here in Europe. The majority of appartment blocks in
Austria are built by companies, that are at least partly communal
property, or that get subsidized for conforming to communal needs.
It's market-oriented (no way the rich could miss out), but subsidies
and the public shares guarantee, that even low incomes enable living
in dignity.

Of course, prices still rise, especially in the non-subsidized
sector, and of course the "conservative" parties try their best to
break the system. So far, it's been remarkably resistant though.

Basically it's always easy to scare people of what they could have.
Once they have it, it's much harder to convince them, that having
something they take for granted, should better be taken from them.
