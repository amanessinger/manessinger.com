Like everywhere in Eastern Europe, Budapest sees a frantic effort to
renovate. Of course, we have it in Western Europe as well, but here
everything has been gradual for the last 75 years.

In the inner court of this building, there was a big shop called
"Paloma - Fashion &amp; Art". It seems to be closed now. Google says
it's temporary, but the home page does not exist anymore, so maybe
it's permanent. Next time I visit Budapest, I must not forget to
visit the place. I wonder what it looks like now.
