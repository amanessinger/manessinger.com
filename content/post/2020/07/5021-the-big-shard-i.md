12 mm are quite a challenge at times. I really should consider
buying the Laowa 7.5 mm rectilinear lens. That's 15 mm eq, with good
optical quality, and it comes with just 170 g. By the way, they also
have a 9 mm "Zero-D" lens for APS-C. If I had a Sony, that's what
I'd buy for going light. 210 g for 13.5 mm eq!

On the other hand, I haven't used anything but the OM-D E-M1 mk iii
and the 12-100/4 in a long time :smiley:
