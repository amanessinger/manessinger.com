Insects are as alien as it gets. Some people eat them, we all may
end up doing this, but most people feel a strong disgust for the
majority of them. Let's be honest, even a ladybug looks horrible if
you come close enough.

Nevertheless, a world without insects would be doomed to die.
Blossoms wouldn't be pollenized, birds would starve. The whole food
chain would break down.
