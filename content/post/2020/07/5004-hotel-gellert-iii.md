All two USB ports on my Mac are blocked now. 512 GB on each side.
One I've named **BigLight**. It carries the Lightroom catalogs of
2006 and 2007. The other, **BigMusic**, has all my music, ripped
from about 3000 CDs, as well of lots of MP3 downloads from Amazon.

Turns out I've exclusively streamed Spotify for years, because I
didn't have my music with me where I hear it most: on the train
:smiley:

It's also not so important to have all my Lightroom catalogs with me
all the time. On the Mac's SSD I have 2018 (that's what I currently
blog about), 2019 (that's what I still have not finished processing)
and 2020.

Having 2006 and 2007 on the permanently mounted stick gives me the
option to continue re-working old images with new tools and new
experience.

And then: in reality I lack time for all of that :stuck_out_tongue:
