Sometimes I ask myself what must a politician do today, in order to
get forced to resign? Our H.C.&nbsp;Strache, former leader of the so
called Freedom Party, a right fringe, conspiration mongering, deeply
populist party, that in the end always caters to the rich, this
Strache, had to resign after being caught on video, discussing all
sorts of intended corruptions. Lots of alcohol was involved, and
the white lines on the table may or may not have been sugar. After
all, doesn't sugar always naturally fall in straight lines? 

There was much more. Party money purportedly spent for private
purposes, blatant attempts to put cronies into important positions
in publicly owned companies, and so on and so on.

And now, a year after? H.C.&nbsp;Strache has a new party and is a
candidate for the office of Mayor of Vienna. Don't get me wrong, he
won't make it, but just that he can run for office, and that
anything between five and 10 percent of Vienna's voters plan voting
for him is a scandal.

And Trump? 70.000 and rising. Just one other country in the world
has an equally idiotic response to Covid-19, and that is governed by
an equally idiotic president.

Will they get away with it? It is our duty, to make sure they don't.
It is our duty, to elect a government rooted in reason. It is our
choice. This is not a game, and if we treat it like one, we can only
lose.
