I must have made countless images like this in Vienna. 

Is this a tremendously stupid sentence? I guess it is, but: there
are definitely more then I bother to ever count.

And: you can clearly see that Austria and Hungary were united during
a defining period of the currently still dominating architecture. In
their centers, that is.

Outside of the center (and I haven't been there, I've only seen it
on [Google
Maps](https://www.google.at/maps/place/Budapest,+Hungary/@47.4882832,19.270052,3546m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x4741c334d1d4cfc9:0x400c4290c1e1160!8m2!3d47.497912!4d19.040235)),
Budapest is a city made mostly of small, one-family homes. Budapest
is different from all other former communist capitals. Everywhere
else you see badly built high-rise buildings. Buapest is different.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's something in the
Hungarian national character, maybe it's the fact that all is flat,
but Budapest is a sprawl like otherwise only found in the US.

Anyway. Judging from their respective centers' architectural styles,
you'd have a hard time telling Budapest and Vienna apart.
