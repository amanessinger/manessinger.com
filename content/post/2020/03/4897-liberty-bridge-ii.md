I write this post on March 11, while being on the train from Vienna
to Carinthia.

Trains are pretty empty these days, and so are the streets of
Vienna. It's not like in Italy, but it's already less crowded. We
brace ourselves for the coming lock-down. Already all sports events
have been canceled, universities closed, and schools will follow
soon. I wonder how long I will be able to commute freely.

This is inconvenient for many, tragic for everyone in tourism
business, but it doesn't particularly impede me. I can write my
programs everywhere.

In face of the situation it is the only sensible way to go. We have
206 total cases today, +24 against yesterday. That's still pretty
moderate. A general public washing hands, holding distances and
avoiding crowds, that's the recipe for slowing the increase and
keeping the peak low. That's the main target now: never have more
severe cases than available intensive care beds.

Vienna, with about 25% of Austria's population, has about 700
intensive care beds. Of course they are not all empty. If you take a
look at Italy, they have about 8.500 active cases and 877 of them
severe or critical. Milan, the biggest and richest city in the worst
affected region, has about two thirds of Vienna's population. They
are already slightly over their capacity.

That's what everybody tries to avoid: not being able to treat the
worst cases, those who wouldn't survive without intensive care.

Or you can have [other
priorities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-coronavirus-politics)
like Donald Trump.

Edit: oops! 206/+24, that an intermediate result. Today we really
have 246/+64, and that's a dramatic rise!
