And here we have it. The last image from Chioggia. I wonder when
I'll return.

I write this on March 1. The post will appear in 10 days. The
COVID-19 outbreak in Italy has started 10 days ago. Today there are
1694 cases in Italy, with so far 34 deaths. My post for today,
written a week ago, was overly optimistic and obviously stupid from
today's POV.

Impossible to know what will be when you read this post.
