If you neither want to climb Gell√©rt hill nor walk along river
Danube on the busy street between hill and river, your first way
each day is across [Liberty
Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Bridge_(Budapest)).

Originally the bridge was named after our good Emperor Franz Josef,
but when the monarchy was past, the Emperor was out of fashion. Not
his wife Elizabeth, by the way. She still has her bridge, one
upstream.
