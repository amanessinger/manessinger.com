The [Hotel
Gell√©rt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Gell%C3%A9rt) is
slightly off-center, on the same side as the Buda Castle, but with a
hill in between. The hotel is  part of an impressive thermal spa
complex. It's not cheap but well worth it. The room was fine and the
view pretty nice as well :smiley:
