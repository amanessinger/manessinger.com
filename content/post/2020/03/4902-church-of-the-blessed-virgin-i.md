And here we are in our first church. It's the Church of the Blessed
Virgin, one bridge upstream, on the eastern shore.

Btw: it's hard to appreciate in times of the virus, but: welcome to
Spring. At least on my half of the globe. For everyone down under:
let gentle rains of fall soothe your burned land.
