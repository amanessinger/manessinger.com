Part of my lamentable inability to have a good overview of my past
can be solved and will be solved next fall. Basically I could solve
it now, but I won't replace my current Macbook Pro as long as it
gets supported with updates.

This should stop in fall. Theoretically I could keep the current Mac
for a while, even if it gets no security updates any more. For
instance I could keep it, as long as I get updates for Lightroom, my
programming tools and my browsers. Everything that I use to
interface with the Internet is open source anyway.

The current computer is also fast enough and has enough memory. Yes,
I really could keep it.

So it's not a necessity to upgrade, at least not for one or two more
years, it's just that I yearn for finally a decently sized SSD.
What's decent, you ask? Well, the current top model has 8 TB SSD.
That's decent :yum:

Of course 4 TB would be enough as well, but given that I intend to
keep my next Macbook Pro for another six years, it would be stupid
to not buy it maxed out. I see that with my current machine. The
price of the 1 TB model was 500â‚¬ higher, and I've regretted that
"saved amount" soon after and every day since.

Once I have a decently sized SSD, I'll be able to have all my images
of 14 years in one big Lightroom catalog. Ready to be searched,
always ready to be worked upon. That will solve my problem :smiley:
