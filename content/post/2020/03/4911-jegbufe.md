So it seems I've given up the idea to go back to Windows. You may
remember, last year I bought a Windows laptop with quite decent
specs for a moderate amount of money. It was light, only 13 inches
and with only HD resolution, but otherwise more or less up to par
with my Mac.

I used it to find out whether I can work on Windows or not. At that
time that was not the case when it came to programming. I gave the
laptop to my sister and this was that.

A year ago, the Linux subsystem on Windows was still a little
isolated and some of my tools didn't work on it. I tried using a
virtual machine, but that proved clumsy compared to the seamlessness
on the Mac. I mean, a Mac is not Linux, but it's UNIX and that's
close enough. I can perfectly work on a Mac and at that time I still
couldn't on Windows. Many people will disagree, but it depends on
how much Linux programming you do, and I do a lot.

In the meantime, Microsoft has made big strides towards advanced
integration of Linux. A new version of the Windows Subsystem for
Linux (a strange name, it's actually the other way round) is now
generally available.

Currently [WSL 2 is only available for members of the Windows
Insider
Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install).
It's probably a good time to try it now. Of course the laptop is not
available any more, but I have a fairly powerful Windows desktop in
Carinthia, that I use for Gaming and for work. There I just download
Windows 10, version 2004, the preview of what will be generally
available next month. I'll keep you updated :smiley:

This could change things. Unfortunately the Windows laptop
manufacturers so far don't catch up on SSD capacity. 2TB is still
the maximum amount you can get, and that's not enough for my planned
single Lightroom catalog. 4 TB would probably suffice. So, I might
still make the switch, but it all depends on SSD capacities on the
market this fall.
