This "canal" is part of the moat around the castle in the center of
Sirmione. It's maybe 50 meters from the hotel.

I think this was the last vacation that I've used the 12-40/2.8 and
the 40-150/2.8. These days I almost exclusively use the 12-100/4.
And why not? Look at this picture: It's f3.5 and 1/15s. 

At f4 I'd have maybe 1/10s, but with the combined stabilizations of
lens and body, I can hold 12mm reliably at 1s, most of the time at
2s, and if I brace myself, 4 seconds are an option. I don't even
have to raise ISO for that. If I do, and if I go to still very clean
ISO 800, I win two more stops. If I need to, I comfortably raise ISO
to 1600 or even 3200, and still am able to process the image.
