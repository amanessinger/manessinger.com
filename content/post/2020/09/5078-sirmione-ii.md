Sirmione is in the middle of an extremely narrow peninsula, reaching
into the lake from its southern end. At the northern tip is a rock
with the remains of a Roman palace.

These two buildings are our hotel, the Hotel Sirmione e Promessi
Sposi. It's right inside the city wall. Extremely recommendable. The
city is closed for tourist cars and has a big parking area in front
of the walls. If you rather be nearer to your car, there's also a
Grand Hotel directly outside. It faces east though, and the
roundabout between it and the city gate is busy all day. I prefer
the comparative silence inside and looking into the sundown.
