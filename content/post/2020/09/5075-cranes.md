Two years ago, these were the first cranes that they've erected
opposite of my apartment in Vienna. In the meantime, there are about
15 blocks, and it's still not finished.

Almost all of them are apartment blocks. The city really tried hard
to get a mixed use, but the market for offices is extremely
competitive, and when you only have apartments, it's not very
attractive for shops and restaurants either. What you want
are busy streets during the whole day, but what you get from the
invisible hand of the market are bedroom communities.
