This rather spooky view of Sirmione's castle was processed with DxO
and it's incomparable PRIME noise reduction. It's ISO 200, but the
walls were so dark, that Lightroom couldn't get any detail in the
shadows. With DxO, the result is very decent.

Oh, by the way, did I tell you, that DxO had an update and I can use
it on Catalina again? So happy :sweat_smile:
