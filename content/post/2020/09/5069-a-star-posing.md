Three or four years ago I've bought an Olympus TG-5. It's an amazing
compact camera, waterproof down to 15 meters, I think (look it up
before trying though), and I use it once or twice a year while
skin-diving. Well, let me tell you, framing under water, trying to
get down as far as possible, that's a tough challenge
 
No, I didn't frame it that way. This is a crop :smiley:
