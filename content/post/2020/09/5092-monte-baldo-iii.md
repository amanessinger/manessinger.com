We were moderately lucky. No clouds at the top. There was a lot of
haze in the valley and on the lake though. In the end I did my best
to cut through it in Lightroom. I'd say the result is not too bad.

That's always the problem with vacation photography: you are never
there at the best of times. Obviously that's a common problem. Image
searches of iconic locations often yield a remarkable number of
impressive images in the most dramatic lighting conditions. Not so
much here though. 

Depending on your hotel's location, it's a multi-hours drive to the
bottom terminal in Malcesina. Then you have to wait in line for your
ticket, for your car. The first car goes up at 8:00, the last goes
down at 18:45. In other words, if you are there for golden hours,
sunrises or sunsets, you are quite restricted. It shows in people's
pictures. It does in mine :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
