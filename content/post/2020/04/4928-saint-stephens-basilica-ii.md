This is a good example for why I use Olympus Micro Four Thirds
cameras, why I've recently upgraded, and why I'd probably do the
next upgrade as well: stabilization.

In a dark church, focal length 100&nbsp;mm (eq. 200&nbsp;mm), ISO
200. Conventional wisdom says, you need 1/200&nbsp;s. Well, even
unstabilized, I think I could always hold 1/100&nbsp;s, maybe
1/50&nbsp;s. This is 1/5&nbsp;s though. And that's still the old
camera :smiley:
