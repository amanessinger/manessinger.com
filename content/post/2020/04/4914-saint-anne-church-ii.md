I have spent less than five minutes in this church. I've spent maybe
10 minutes on each picture, maybe the same time writing about it.
It's not much, but it might give me a chance to remember the church.
At least while I see the 2018 Lightroom catalog at least once a day.

When I try to remember the images of 2017, not much is present. The
2017 catalog is archived. In order to see its pictures, I'd have to
use an external drive. I thought I would, but I never do. That's why
I crave for at least 4 TB of SSD in my next laptop :smiley:
