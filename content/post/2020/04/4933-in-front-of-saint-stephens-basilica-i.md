Here's a typical win for black and white. The image is about
contrast anyway. There are some flares, but they don't distract in
black and white. The dark sky has its problems with halos, but,
well, for me it's still acceptable. Should I ever want to print it
big, I'd have to take care of them.

I love it how the movement on the stairs flows into the square and
then on into the gap of the road on the opposite side. I also love
what the condensation trails do with the tower on the far side.
