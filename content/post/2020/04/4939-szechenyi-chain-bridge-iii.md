Crowds again on a beautiful bridge, this time in nostalgic black and
white :smiley:

Frustration? Yes, but I'm privileged as hell. I have a job, that's
perfectly suited for home office, my employer can't go out of
business, and in reality I can't complain about anything but
boredom.

In general, Austria does a lot for its people. Not only for its
industries, but also for its people. It's a sane system. Nobody will
go hungry, nobody will stay uneducated, nobody will be left sick.
Our system is about as socialist as Bernie Sanders visions go. We
live what neo-liberals say is impossible. A communist society? No,
we are governed by a Conservative and a Green party. We prosper and
still take care of each other. And that's **really** the normal.
