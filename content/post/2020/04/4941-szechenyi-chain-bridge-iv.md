It seems like we'll get kind of a life again. Restrictions will
still apply to a certain extent, but more shops and even restaurants
will open, small events will be possible, and even hotels and spas
will be accessible again.

At the same time, a storm of fake news and propaganda rages. 5G has
been identified as the reason for COVID-19, vaccines are going to
kill all of us, and if you dig deeper, you quickly find open
anti-semitism again. The militant Right has found fertile grounds,
and armies of idiots feel suddenly vindicated. We knew it!!!

We are not at the point yet, when Flat Earthers gain reputability,
but we can't be too far. And I pretty much know which president will
embrace them.
