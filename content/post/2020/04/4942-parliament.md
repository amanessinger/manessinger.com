Budapest has a certain quality, that I love in cities. A river runs
through it! Of course Vienna also lies on river Danube, but their
relation is more tangential. In Budapest (like in London, Rome,
Florence or Paris), the river goes right through the center. The main sights are along both shores. Parliament is one of them.
