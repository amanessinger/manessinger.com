Below the main altar is the crypt. Frequently, crypts are basically
a story below the main floor. Not so here. The crypt is slightly
below, but the main altar is a story above. 

It's a variation on the theme of the choir screen that you see in so
many monastery churches. The choir was for the monks, the nave
for the lay people.
