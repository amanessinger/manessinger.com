Here's a detail from above the altar. Not Mantegna obviously. Why
not more Mantegna? Doesn't the altar have six major fields?

Well, it has, but trying to get a picture without someone's head in
it is not a trivial task. It's not as bad as trying to take a photo
of the Mona Lisa (or just having a look on it), but it can be bad
enough.
