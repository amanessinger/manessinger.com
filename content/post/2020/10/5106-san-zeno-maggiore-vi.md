You see, no fountain! I wonder if there ever has one been, and if
yes, why they destroyed it. Or else, what the pavillion was used
for? Yes, I know, this is the 21<sup>st</sup> century, so let's look
it up in Wikipedia :stuck_out_tongue:

Ok, Wikipedia was it no, but gladly the websites of Italian churches
tend to be excellent. It was a washhouse and the fountain was
nearby, on the north side of the cloister :grin:
