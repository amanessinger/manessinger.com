It's funny how people get obsessed with computing fashions. One of
them is dark mode. I'm not sure where this fad originated. Was it
Apple, as so often? Was it the developer community?

Nevertheless, meanwhile all operating systems have more or less good
dark mode support. None of them is perfect, not even Apple's MacOS,
maybe not even iOS, but for lack of an iPhone or iPad I can't tell.

I've tried it. It looks good. I've set every program on my Mac to
use "System mode", I've manually changed everything that could be
changed but didn't follow system mode, I've even set colors manually
where they wouldn't fit.

The result looked slick.

Just as it's supposed to do.

And then we got an expensive, big marquee for our terrace in
Villach. I could sit in the shade, I could work outside, except that
I couldn't. Dark mode is fine for working at night. It makes you
feel like Batman, and that's certainly a cool feeling. During
daylight and outdoors? Forget it.

I would probably try switching automatically, depending on time of
day, but as I said, not even on the Mac all programs play by the
rules. Until then, I'm back to wonderfully uncomplicated black and
white.
