Believe me, whatever you'll buy in that shop will please you. 

In its prestigious first district, Vienna also has shops like this:
old, small and offering only the finest products. The difference is,
in Vienna these shops are outrageously expensive. They are survivors
from an imperial past and they show it. In Italy, they are shabbier
but more lively. Normal people buy there.
