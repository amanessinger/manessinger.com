This is the same structure as in the last image, only I've used a
longer lens. This is the Santuario della Nostra Signora di Lourdes.
I have not been there. It's modern architecture, not outstanding,
but I guess next time I'll pay a visit, if alone for the view.

I'm writing this post on October 31, and when you read it, we may
already know how the elections went. This would be in the case of a
blue landslide. Biden would be decisively ahead in the morning, and
from there on, the outstanding ballots would only increase his lead.
Everybody but Trump would concede Biden's victory. The game would be
over.

That's the best case. 

I don't think that Trump can win a fair election, but I am sure that
he would use the tiniest lead in the morning, to immediately claim
victory, and to try to suppress counting further votes. This might
not work, but he would try to bring it to "his" Supreme Court, and
from there everything could happen. Let's see. By the time you read
this, we might at least have an idea.
