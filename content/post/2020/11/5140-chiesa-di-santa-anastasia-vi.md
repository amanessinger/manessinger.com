Now this comes as a little bit of a surprise. The filename of this
image is 20180911_142351-Pano_lr.jpg, which means, that I've
stitched the image as a vertical panorama from two exposure already
ultrawide.

Turns out the result is pretty good and maybe I should do that more
often. And, of course, this is so easy with Lightroom.

Lightroom (much more than Photoshop) is my main reason to not use
Linux. I'd love to have a Linux laptop for work, but alas, I need
this one proprietary software. Just that one.
