One more side chapel. There are quite a few in this church. 

Corona-wise things are scary at the moment. Austria had one of the
better responses in Spring, but this fall, like in most of Europe,
we failed pretty badly.

We have a strong lockdown again, tentatively scheduled to last until
December 7. Actually we will need it. Numbers of new infections are
already stagnating, though on a high level.

How bad is it? Peak values for new infections were up to 9.500
before the weekend. They were back to 4.500 on Monday, but Monday is
always low. Still, less than half, that would indicate a slowdown.
Compared to the US, this is worse. We have 1/40<sup>th</sup> of the
population, thus it's as if the US had 380.000 per day. This means
it's twice as bad here.

Deaths are still rising and will continue to rise. We are not yet
saturating our health system, but we are slightly over 50% of ICUs
used. That means no more doubling. 

Over the weekend, we seem to have had 85 and 83 deaths per day. In
the US, this would mean ~2.500, that'S slightly lower than when the
US peaked out at 2744 on April 21. Wow, that is bad!
