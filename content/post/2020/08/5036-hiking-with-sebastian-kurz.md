Sebastian Kurz is our young chancellor, head of the government. He
was the youngest politician to ever reach this position. 

As foreign minister, he toppled the then leader of ÖVP, Austria's
People's Party, the traditional conservatives in Austria. ÖVP was
minor partner in a coalition with the Social Democrats. He broke the
coalition for early general elections, and after a dirty campaign on
both sides, he remained victorious.

Kurz formed a government with the far-right Freedom Party, and
together they were a successfully self-serving, deeply populist
team. After the Freedom Party's self-destruction with the so-called
Ibiza scandal, another election strengthened Kurz even more. He now
governs with the left to moderate Green Party. Quite the change!

The new government has handled the critical initial phase of the
corona crisis very well. For that he has earned my respect. He's a
man who knows how to reach his goals. In general, I think we'd be
better off with someone less talented in intrigue, someone less
interested in his own career, someone less masterful in acting the
role of the responsible head of government, someone more being it.
He might grow though.

Anyway. So far, the moderation of the Greens manages to balance his
ambitions. This will go on as long as Kurz believes to need them.
We'll see.
