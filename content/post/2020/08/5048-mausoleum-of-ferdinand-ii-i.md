No, this might seem like stutter in the title, but it is not. This
is the first in a series of posts featuring the mausoleum of Emperor
Ferdinand II in Graz.

He was the original "Gran Fernando", that Monteverdi devoted his
8<sup>th</sup> Book of Madrigals to. Ferdinand was married to a
Gonzaga princess, Monteverdi worked at the Gonzaga court, so this
was a natural affair. Unfortunately Ferdinand died shortly before
publication. Therefore, his son, Ferdinand III, ended up as
Monteverdi's "Gran Fernando". Always good to have choices
