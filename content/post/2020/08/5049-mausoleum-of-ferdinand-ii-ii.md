Again I've made this image an HDR. You've got the altar top with
brightly lit windows behind. Contrast is insane.

I used to use special HDR tools, but I haven't done so in a long
time. I don't even know the names any more. Photomatix Pro? Well, I
think that was the best ten years ago. Today you just use Lightroom,
and it does a marvelous job.
