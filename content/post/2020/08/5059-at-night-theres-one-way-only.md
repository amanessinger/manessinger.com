We had a few posts about my doubts concerning future Apple
computers, my speculations about the viability of a Windows-based
high-end notebook, and I've finally made a decision:

I've bought a new power supply for my current mid-2014 Macbook Pro
:stuck_out_tongue:

4 cores, 8 threads @ 2.5 GHz regular, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, two 512
GB USB micro thumbdrives for media, the upcoming MacOS Big Sur
supported. I've decided I have no pain points, I can wait one more
year. My power supply couldn't.
