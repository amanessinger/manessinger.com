This is one of those high contrast situations, that DxO handles so
well: Expose for the highlights, lighten up the shadows and use DxP
PRIME noise reduction to get rid of any noise creeping up. On my Mac
it takes 40 seconds per image. That's slow, but when you realize,
that for every pixel DxO analyzes 1000 neighboring pixels (at least
that's what I remember to have read), it's actually fairly quick.
The result is the best I've ever seen for any noise reduction
software.

It's only, that it doesn't work anymore. Today I wanted to start it
and see if there's an upgrade. I'm not sure if I've ever used it
since upgrading my Mac to Catalina. In any case, it hangs on start.

It obviously lacks permission to access the pictures folder and
external drives. I can see that in the Security and Privacy panel.
Other programs are listed, DxO is not. Normally, when a program
tries to access a location where it has no permission, the system
asks whether to grant or refuse the request. That's how programs get
into the list. 

With Catalina, Apple has taken away the option to manually add a
program to the list and give it permissions. It's also not a matter
of just entering something in Google and getting the solution. Other
people seem to have no problem.

There have been initial problems with DxO and Catalina, but DxO
considers them fixed. They warn to upgrade the program before
upgrading to Catalina. Well, I didn't, because I need the program
only once in a long while.

This makes me the proud owner of DxO Photolab 3 Elite, a wonderful
tool that I can't use at all. Now I can only sit and wonder who to
blame, DxO or Apple :rage:
