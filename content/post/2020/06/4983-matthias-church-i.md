Hungary has a favor for painted churches. This one is freshly
renovated. It might seem garish at first, but while we've become
accustomed to white-washed church walls and naked stone, in reality
all churches originally were richly painted. I don't know if this is
a true restoration or a bold re-interpretation, but I definitely
like it.

Technically the image is an HDR. HDR merging programs (like the one
built into Lightroom) have options to reduce "ghosts", but here it
would have been completely futile, with all the people in the
church, constantly coming and going.

This is one of the main attractions in Budapest. You simply
have to accept it and take what you get. If you think of it: trying
to take a photo of Mona Lisa is worse :smiley:
