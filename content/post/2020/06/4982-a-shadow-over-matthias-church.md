Extreme perspective correction is always problematic, but in this
case less so than the extreme distortions of the out-of-camera file.
Yes, the tower looks too high. Shooting from a higher vantage point
solves the problem, but unfortunately I lack the power of
levitation. At least that's more or less what the church looks like.
