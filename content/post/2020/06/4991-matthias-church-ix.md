I'm writing this post while on the train from Vienna to Carinthia.
If Amazon is right, a small parcel awaits me with temporary relief
for my storage problems.

Remember my Mac? 512 GB SSD, that felt cramped a month after I
bought it?

Well, a few years ago I bought a 128 GB USB stick. A short one, that
protrudes just five or six millimeters. Two years ago capacity had
doubled, and when I recently looked, SanDisk had one with 512 GB.
That's cool :)
