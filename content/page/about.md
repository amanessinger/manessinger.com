My name is Andreas Manessinger and this is my blog. It‚Äôs a photo blog, and that means, every post has a photo. Well, apart from those rare administrative posts that have none. Posts with photos have a number in their title, counting upwards.

This is not only a photo blog, it‚Äôs a daily photo blog as well, meaning that I post a photo per day. In fact I post at least a photo per day, but only one of them is the Image of the Day. ‚ÄúDaily‚Äù is a relative term though. It does not mean ‚Äústrictly every day‚Äù, rather it means, that in the long run there is a numbered post per day. At every given moment I may be one, two, seldom more, days behind my schedule, but normally I catch up within a few days, sometimes posting more than one entry per day.

I am never ahead of schedule. The reason is, that I post images that were taken on the day that the post represents. This is a hard rule that I break every once in a while, normally because I had no time, weather was bad or I found any other excuse. On such days I resurface something from the archives. It does not happen too often though.

I live in Austria. That‚Äôs at the heart of Europe, the home of Mozart, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Adolf Hitler, the best skiing nation in the world and the worst in soccer, rich in culture, dramatic in landscapes, timid in politics. It‚Äôs a small, rich and beautiful country, Vienna being its capital. Vienna is where I work during the week, programming computers, and Carinthia, the sunny south of Austria, a region of mountains and lakes, is where is spend my weekends. I was born in Carinthia, studied in Vienna and have been living there since 1984.

I began taking photographs in 2004, then using a five megapixel Kodak DX 7590 bridge camera. In May 2006 I bought my first DSLR, a Nikon D200, and since November 2007 I have its successor, the D300, a camera that currently fulfills all my needs and that I may continue to use for quite a while. I use a variety of lenses from Nikon, Sigma, Tokina, and sometimes I even use a Lensbaby.

Artistically I am mostly interested in results, not in process, thus I have no inhibitions at all to use Photoshop. I am an artist, not a journalist. You may catch me twisting and bending things, conjuring them up or making them vanish. You will have a hard time characterizing my ‚Äústyle‚Äù. At least it cannot be defined in terms of process. This is a feature üôÇ

And now I don‚Äôt want to keep you any longer from enjoying the pictures.
