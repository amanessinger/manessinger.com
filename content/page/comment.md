Thanks for coming here to leave a comment. Very much appreciated üëç

Please note that:

* The name that you leave will be published alongside with your comment. You may use any name you like, although I favor real names. Your choice though.
* If you leave an email address, it will of course neither be published on my site nor in the source repository of this site on GitHub. I value your privacy highly. I may reply by email though.
* If you leave a website URL, your name will be published as a link to your website.
* Between the time you submit your comment and the time I moderate
  it, (up to a maximum of 14 days, normally much shorter) all the
  data you submit is stored in an Amazon AWS SQS message queue. 
  Nobody but me can read from that queue. As soon as your comment 
  has been processed, it is removed from the queue.
